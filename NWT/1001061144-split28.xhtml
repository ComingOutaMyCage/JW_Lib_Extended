<p id="p238" data-pid="238" class="p238 sb"><span id="chapter28_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> And look! a great earthquake had taken place, for Jehovah’s<span id="footnotesource193"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote193">*</a> angel had descended from heaven and had come and rolled away the stone, and he was sitting on it. <span id="chapter28_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow. <span id="chapter28_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Yes, out of their fear of him, the watchmen trembled and became as dead men.</p>
<p id="p239" data-pid="239" class="p239 sb"><span id="chapter28_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> But the angel said to the women: “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was executed on the stake. <span id="chapter28_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> He is not here, for he was raised up, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying. <span id="chapter28_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead, for look! he is going ahead of you into Galʹi·lee. You will see him there. Look! I have told you.”</p>
<p id="p240" data-pid="240" class="p240 sb"><span id="chapter28_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples. <span id="chapter28_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> And look! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” They approached and took hold of his feet and did obeisance<span id="footnotesource194"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote194">*</a> to him. <span id="chapter28_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> Then Jesus said to them: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers so that they may go to Galʹi·lee, and there they will see me.”</p>
<p id="p241" data-pid="241" class="p241 sb"><span id="page1348" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1348" data-before-text="1348"></span><span id="pos133283"></span><span id="chapter28_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. <span id="chapter28_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> And after these had gathered with the elders and had consulted together, they gave a considerable number of silver pieces to the soldiers <span id="chapter28_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> and said: “Say, ‘His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’ <span id="chapter28_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> And if this gets to the governor’s ears, we will explain the matter to<span id="footnotesource195"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote195">*</a> him and you will not need to worry.” <span id="chapter28_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed, and this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.</p>
