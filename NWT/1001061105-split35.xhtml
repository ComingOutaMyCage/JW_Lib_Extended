<p id="p293" data-pid="293" class="p293 sb"><span id="chapter35_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him: “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst, and cleanse yourselves and change your garments, <span id="chapter35_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> and let us rise and go up to Bethʹel. There I will make an altar to the true God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever<span id="footnotesource262"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote262">*</a> I have gone.” <span id="chapter35_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried<span id="footnotesource263"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote263">*</a> them under the big tree that was close to Sheʹchem.</p>
<p id="p294" data-pid="294" class="p294 sb"><span id="pos139804"></span><span id="chapter35_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> When they traveled on, the terror of God struck the cities around them, so they did not chase after the sons of Jacob. <span id="chapter35_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Jacob eventually came to Luz, that is, Bethʹel, in the land of Caʹnaan, he and all the people with him. <span id="chapter35_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> There he built an altar and called the place El-bethʹel,<span id="footnotesource264"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote264">*</a> because there the true God had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother. <span id="chapter35_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Later Debʹo·rah, Re·bekʹah’s nurse, died and was buried at the foot of Bethʹel under an oak. So he named it Alʹlon-bacʹuth.<span id="footnotesource265"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote265">*</a></p>
<p id="p295" data-pid="295" class="p295 sb"><span id="chapter35_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> God appeared to Jacob once again while he was coming from Padʹdan-aʹram and blessed him. <span id="chapter35_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> God said to him: “Your name is Jacob. Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel will be your name.” And he began to call him Israel. <span id="chapter35_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> God further said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and become many. Nations and a congregation of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you.<span id="footnotesource266"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote266">*</a> <span id="chapter35_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will give it, <span id="page89" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span>and to your offspring<span id="footnotesource267"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote267">*</a> after you I will give the land.” <span id="chapter35_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.</p>
<p id="p296" data-pid="296" class="p296 sb"><span id="chapter35_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. <span id="chapter35_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> And Jacob continued to call the place where God had spoken with him Bethʹel.</p>
<p id="p297" data-pid="297" class="p297 sb"><span id="pos141200"></span><span id="chapter35_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> Then they pulled away from Bethʹel. And while they were still some distance from Ephʹrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was very difficult. <span id="chapter35_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17</sup></strong> But while she was struggling to deliver the child, the midwife said to her: “Do not be afraid, for you will have this son also.” <span id="chapter35_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18</sup></strong> Just as her life was slipping away<span id="footnotesource268"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote268">*</a> (for she was dying), she named him Ben-oʹni,<span id="footnotesource269"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote269">*</a> but his father called him Benjamin.<span id="footnotesource270"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote270">*</a> <span id="chapter35_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19</sup></strong> So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephʹrath, that is, Bethʹle·hem. <span id="chapter35_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20</sup></strong> Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.</p>
<p id="p298" data-pid="298" class="p298 sb"><span id="pos141799"></span><span id="chapter35_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> After that Israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of Eʹder. <span id="chapter35_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> Once while Israel was dwelling in that land, Reuʹben went and lay down with Bilʹhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.</p>
<p id="p299" data-pid="299" class="p299 sb">So there were 12 sons of Jacob. <span id="chapter35_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23</sup></strong> The sons by Leʹah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuʹben, then Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun. <span id="chapter35_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24</sup></strong> The sons by Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. <span id="chapter35_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25</sup></strong> And the sons by Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphʹta·li. <span id="chapter35_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26</sup></strong> And the sons by Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, were Gad and Ashʹer. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Padʹdan-aʹram.</p>
