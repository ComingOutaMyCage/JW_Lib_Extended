<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="p31 sb"><span id="pos11840"></span><span id="chapter4"></span><span id="chapter4_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>4</strong> </span>Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced<span id="footnotesource32"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote32">*</a> a male child with the help of Jehovah.” <span id="chapter4_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="p32 sb">Abel became a shepherd of the flock, but Cain became a cultivator of the ground. <span id="chapter4_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> After some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah. <span id="chapter4_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> But Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat. While Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering, <span id="chapter4_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> he did not look with any favor on Cain and on his offering. So Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.<span id="footnotesource33"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote33">*</a> <span id="chapter4_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Then Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you so angry and dejected? <span id="chapter4_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> If you turn to doing good, will you not be restored to favor?<span id="footnotesource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote34">*</a> But if you do not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door, and its craving is to dominate you; but will you get the mastery over it?”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="p33 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> After that Cain said to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.” So while they were in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him. <span id="chapter4_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> Later on, Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?” <span id="chapter4_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> At this He said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. <span id="chapter4_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. <span id="chapter4_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its produce.<span id="footnotesource35"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote35">*</a> You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth.” <span id="chapter4_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The punishment for my error is too great to bear. <span id="chapter4_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> Today you are driving me from the land,<span id="footnotesource36"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote36">*</a> and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me.” <span id="chapter4_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times.”</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="p34 sb">So Jehovah set up<span id="footnotesource37"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote37">*</a> a sign for Cain in order that no one finding him would strike him. <span id="chapter4_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> Then Cain went away from before Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Exile,<span id="footnotesource38"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote38">*</a> to the east of Eʹden.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="p35 sb"><span id="pos14005"></span><span id="chapter4_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17</sup></strong> Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Eʹnoch. Then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son Eʹnoch. <span id="chapter4_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18</sup></strong> Later Iʹrad was born to Eʹnoch. And Iʹrad became father to Me·huʹja·el, and Me·huʹja·el became father to Me·thuʹsha·el, and Me·thuʹsha·el became father to Laʹmech.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="p36 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19</sup></strong> Laʹmech took two wives for himself. The name of the first <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>was Aʹdah, and the name of the second was Zilʹlah. <span id="chapter4_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20</sup></strong> Aʹdah gave birth to Jaʹbal. He was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. <span id="chapter4_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> His brother’s name was Juʹbal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe.<span id="footnotesource39"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote39">*</a> <span id="chapter4_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> Also, Zilʹlah gave birth to Tuʹbal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tuʹbal-cain was Naʹa·mah. <span id="chapter4_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23</sup></strong> Then Laʹmech composed these words for his wives Aʹdah and Zilʹlah:</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="p37 sz">“Hear my voice, you wives of Laʹmech;</p><p data-pid="37" class="p37 sz">Give ear to my saying:</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="p38 sz">A man I have killed for wounding me,</p><p data-pid="38" class="p38 sz">Yes, a young man for striking me.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="p39 sl"><span id="chapter4_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24</sup></strong> If 7 times Cain is to be avenged,</p><p data-pid="39" class="p39 sz">Then Laʹmech 77 times.”</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="p40 sb"><span id="pos15109"></span><span id="chapter4_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25</sup></strong> Adam again had sexual relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth<span id="footnotesource40"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote40">*</a> because, as she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring<span id="footnotesource41"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote41">*</a> in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” <span id="chapter4_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26</sup></strong> There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Eʹnosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah.</p>
