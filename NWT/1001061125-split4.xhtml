<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="p40 sb"><span id="pos9057"></span><span id="chapter4"></span><span id="chapter4_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>4</strong> </span>Again I turned my attention to all the acts of oppression that go on under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and there was no one to comfort them. And their oppressors had the power, and there was no one to comfort them. <span id="chapter4_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> And I congratulated the dead who had already died rather than the living who were still alive. <span id="chapter4_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> And better off than both of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the distressing deeds that are done under the sun.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="p41 sb"><span id="pos9535"></span><span id="chapter4_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> And I have seen how much effort<span id="footnotesource29"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote29">*</a> and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="p42 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> The stupid one folds his hands while his flesh wastes away.<span id="footnotesource30"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote30">*</a></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="p43 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="p44 sb"><span id="pos9831"></span><span id="chapter4_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> I turned my attention to another example of futility under the sun: <span id="chapter4_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> There is a man who is all alone, without any companion; he has no son or brother, but there is no end to all his hard work. His eyes are never satisfied with riches. But does he ask himself, ‘For whom am I working hard and depriving myself<span id="footnotesource31"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote31">*</a> of good things’? This too is futility and a miserable occupation.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="p45 sb"><span id="pos10216"></span><span id="chapter4_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> Two are better than one because they have a good reward<span id="footnotesource32"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote32">*</a> for their hard work. <span id="chapter4_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> For if one of them falls, the other can help his partner up. But what will happen to the one who falls with no one to help him up?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="p46 sb"><span id="chapter4_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> Moreover, if two lie down together, they will stay warm, but how can just one keep warm? <span id="chapter4_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> And someone may overpower one alone, but two together can take a stand against him. And a threefold cord cannot quickly<span id="footnotesource33"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote33">*</a> be torn apart.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="p47 sb"><span id="pos10676"></span><span id="chapter4_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> Better is a poor but wise child than an old but stupid king, who no longer has enough sense to heed a warning. <span id="chapter4_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> For he<span id="footnotesource34"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote34">*</a> went out from prison to become king, although in that one’s kingship he was born poor. <span id="chapter4_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> I considered all those alive who walk about under the sun, as well as how it goes with the young successor who stands up in the other’s place. <span id="chapter4_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> Although there is no end to all his supporters, those who come later will not be happy with him. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.</p>
