<p id="p1095" data-pid="1095" class="p1095 sl"><span id="chapter42_verse2"></span> <strong><sup>2</sup></strong> “Now I know that you are able to do all things</p><p data-pid="1095" class="p1095 sz">And that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you.</p>
<p id="p1096" data-pid="1096" class="p1096 sl"><span id="chapter42_verse3"></span> <strong><sup>3</sup></strong> You said, ‘Who is this who is obscuring my counsel without knowledge?’</p>
<p id="p1097" data-pid="1097" class="p1097 sz">Therefore I spoke, but without understanding</p><p data-pid="1097" class="p1097 sz">About things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.</p>
<p id="p1098" data-pid="1098" class="p1098 sl"><span id="chapter42_verse4"></span> <strong><sup>4</sup></strong> You said, ‘Please listen, and I will speak.</p>
<p id="p1099" data-pid="1099" class="p1099 sz">I will question you, and you inform me.’</p>
<p id="p1100" data-pid="1100" class="p1100 sl"><span id="chapter42_verse5"></span> <strong><sup>5</sup></strong> My ears have heard about you,</p><p data-pid="1100" class="p1100 sz">But now I do see you with my eyes.</p>
<p id="p1101" data-pid="1101" class="p1101 sl"><span id="chapter42_verse6"></span> <strong><sup>6</sup></strong> That is why I take back what I said,<span id="footnotesource374"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote374">*</a></p><p data-pid="1101" class="p1101 sz">And I repent in dust and ashes.”</p>
<p id="p1102" data-pid="1102" class="p1102 sb"><span id="pos103199"></span><span id="chapter42_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite:</p>
<p id="p1103" data-pid="1103" class="p1103 sb">“My anger burns against you and your two companions, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has. <span id="chapter42_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt sacrifice for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you. I will surely accept his request<span id="footnotesource375"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote375">*</a> not to deal with you according to your foolishness, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.”</p>
<p id="p1104" data-pid="1104" class="p1104 sb"><span id="chapter42_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> So Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite, Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite, and Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite went and did what Jehovah had told them to do. And Jehovah accepted Job’s prayer.</p>
<p id="p1105" data-pid="1105" class="p1105 sb"><span id="pos103882"></span><span id="chapter42_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> After Job had prayed for his companions, Jehovah removed Job’s tribulation and restored his prosperity.<span id="footnotesource376"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote376">*</a> Jehovah gave him double what he had before. <span id="chapter42_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> All his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and ate a meal with him in his house. They sympathized with him and comforted him over all the calamity that Jehovah had allowed to come upon him. Each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.</p>
<p id="p1106" data-pid="1106" class="p1106 sb"><span id="chapter42_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> So Jehovah blessed the last part of Job’s life more than the beginning, and Job came to have 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 pairs of cattle, and 1,000 female donkeys. <span id="pos104499"></span><span id="chapter42_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> He also came to have seven more sons and three more daughters. <span id="chapter42_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> He named the first daughter Je·miʹmah, the second Ke·ziʹah, and the third Kerʹen-hapʹpuch. <span id="chapter42_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> No women in all the land were as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.</p>
