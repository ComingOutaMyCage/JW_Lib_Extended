<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"><span id="pos63"></span><span id="chapter1"></span><span id="chapter1_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>1</strong> </span>Long ago God spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many occasions and in many ways. <span id="chapter1_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> Now at the end of these days he has spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> <span id="chapter1_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. And after he had made a purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. <span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> So he has become better than the angels to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="pos694"></span><span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”? And again: “I will become his father, and he will become my son”? <span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all of God’s angels do obeisance to him.”<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> Also, he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> a flame of fire.” <span id="chapter1_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> But about the Son, he says: “God is your throne forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.<span id="footnotesource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> <span id="chapter1_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.” <span id="chapter1_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> And: “At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands. <span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out, <span id="chapter1_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> But about which of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”? <span id="chapter1_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> Are they not all spirits for holy service,<span id="footnotesource5"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?</p>
