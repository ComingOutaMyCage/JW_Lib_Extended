<p id="p177" data-pid="177" class="p177 sb"><span id="pos114502"></span><span id="chapter20"></span><span id="chapter20_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>20</strong> </span>On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple and declaring the good news, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came <span id="chapter20_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> and said to him: “Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority?” <span id="chapter20_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> He replied to them: “I will also ask you a question, and you tell me: <span id="chapter20_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?”<span id="footnotesource184"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote184">*</a> <span id="chapter20_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Then they drew conclusions among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ <span id="chapter20_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> But if we say, ‘From men,’ the people one and all will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” <span id="chapter20_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> So they replied that they did not know its source. <span id="chapter20_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Jesus said to them: “Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”</p>
<p id="p178" data-pid="178" class="p178 sb"><span id="pos115283"></span><span id="chapter20_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> Then he began to tell the people this illustration: “A man planted a vineyard and leased it to cultivators, and he traveled abroad for a considerable time. <span id="chapter20_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. The cultivators, however, sent him away empty-handed, after beating him. <span id="chapter20_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> But again he sent another slave. That one also they beat and humiliated<span id="footnotesource185"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote185">*</a> and sent away empty-handed. <span id="chapter20_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> Yet again he sent a third; this one also they wounded and threw out. <span id="chapter20_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> At <span id="page1415" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1415" data-before-text="1415"></span>this the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my son, the beloved. They will likely respect this one.’ <span id="chapter20_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> When the cultivators caught sight of him, they reasoned with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours.’ <span id="chapter20_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them? <span id="chapter20_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> He will come and kill these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others.”</p>
<p id="p179" data-pid="179" class="p179 sb">On hearing this, they said: “Never may that happen!” <span id="chapter20_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17</sup></strong> But he looked straight at them and said: “What, then, does this mean where it is written: ‘The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone’?<span id="footnotesource186"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote186">*</a> <span id="chapter20_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18</sup></strong> Everyone falling on that stone will be shattered. As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.”</p>
<p id="p180" data-pid="180" class="p180 sb"><span id="chapter20_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19</sup></strong> The scribes and the chief priests then sought to get their hands on him in that very hour, but they feared the people, for they realized that he told this illustration with them in mind. <span id="pos116868"></span><span id="chapter20_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20</sup></strong> And after observing him closely, they sent men whom they had secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous in order to catch him in his speech, so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor. <span id="chapter20_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> And they questioned him, saying: “Teacher, we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality, but you teach the way of God in line with truth: <span id="chapter20_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> Is it lawful<span id="footnotesource187"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote187">*</a> for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” <span id="chapter20_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23</sup></strong> But he detected their cunning and said to them: <span id="chapter20_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24</sup></strong> “Show me a de·narʹi·us.<span id="footnotesource188"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote188">*</a> Whose image and inscription does it have?” They said: “Caesar’s.” <span id="chapter20_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25</sup></strong> He said to them: “By all means, then, pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar but God’s things to God.” <span id="chapter20_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26</sup></strong> Well, they were not able to trap him in his speech before the people, but amazed at his answer, they became silent.</p>
<p id="p181" data-pid="181" class="p181 sb"><span id="pos117709"></span><span id="chapter20_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27</sup></strong> However, some of the Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him: <span id="chapter20_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28</sup></strong> “Teacher, Moses wrote us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife, but he was childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’ <span id="chapter20_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29</sup></strong> Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife but died childless. <span id="chapter20_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30</sup></strong> So the second <span id="chapter20_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31</sup></strong> and the third married her. Likewise even all seven; they died and left no children. <span id="chapter20_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32</sup></strong> Finally the woman also died. <span id="chapter20_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33</sup></strong> Consequently, in the resurrection, whose wife will she become? For the seven had her as a wife.”</p>
<p id="p182" data-pid="182" class="p182 sb"><span id="chapter20_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34</sup></strong> Jesus said to them: “The children of this system of things<span id="footnotesource189"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote189">*</a> marry and are given in marriage, <span id="chapter20_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35</sup></strong> but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. <span id="chapter20_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36</sup></strong> In fact, neither can they die anymore, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children by being children of the resurrection. <span id="chapter20_verse37"></span><strong><sup>37</sup></strong> But that the dead are raised up, even Moses made known in the account about the thornbush, when he calls Jehovah<span id="footnotesource190"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote190">*</a> ‘the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob.’ <span id="chapter20_verse38"></span><strong><sup>38</sup></strong> He is a God, not of the dead, but of the <span id="page1416" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1416" data-before-text="1416"></span>living, for they are all living to him.”<span id="footnotesource191"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote191">*</a> <span id="chapter20_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39</sup></strong> In response some of the scribes said: “Teacher, you spoke well.” <span id="chapter20_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40</sup></strong> For they no longer had the courage to ask him a single question.</p>
<p id="p183" data-pid="183" class="p183 sb"><span id="pos119129"></span><span id="chapter20_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41</sup></strong> In turn he asked them: “How is it they say that the Christ is David’s son? <span id="chapter20_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42</sup></strong> For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘Jehovah<span id="footnotesource192"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote192">*</a> said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand <span id="chapter20_verse43"></span><strong><sup>43</sup></strong> until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’ <span id="chapter20_verse44"></span><strong><sup>44</sup></strong> David, therefore, calls him Lord; so how is he his son?”</p>
<p id="p184" data-pid="184" class="p184 sb"><span id="pos119441"></span><span id="chapter20_verse45"></span><strong><sup>45</sup></strong> Then, while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples: <span id="chapter20_verse46"></span><strong><sup>46</sup></strong> “Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and front<span id="footnotesource193"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote193">*</a> seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals, <span id="chapter20_verse47"></span><strong><sup>47</sup></strong> and who devour the houses<span id="footnotesource194"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote194">*</a> of the widows and for show<span id="footnotesource195"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote195">*</a> make long prayers.
