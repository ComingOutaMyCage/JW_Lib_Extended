<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="p2 sb"><span id="pos43"></span><span id="chapter1"></span><span id="chapter1_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>1</strong> </span>Now in the days when the judges administered justice,<span id="footnotesource1"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> a famine occurred in the land; and a man went from Bethʹle·hem in Judah to reside as a foreigner in the fields<span id="footnotesource2"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Moʹab, he along with his wife and his two sons. <span id="chapter1_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> The man’s name was E·limʹe·lech,<span id="footnotesource3"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> his wife’s <span id="page392" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="392" data-before-text="392"></span>name was Na·oʹmi,<span id="footnotesource4"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> and the names of his two sons were Mahʹlon<span id="footnotesource5"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and Chilʹi·on.<span id="footnotesource6"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> They were Ephʹrath·ites from Bethʹle·hem in Judah. And they came to the fields of Moʹab and remained there.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="p3 sb"><span id="pos506"></span><span id="chapter1_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> After some time E·limʹe·lech, Na·oʹmi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. <span id="chapter1_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> The men later married Moʹab·ite women; one was named Orʹpah, and the other was named Ruth. They remained there for about ten years. <span id="chapter1_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Then the two sons, Mahʹlon and Chilʹi·on, also died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband. <span id="chapter1_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> So she started out with her daughters-in-law to return from the fields of Moʹab, for she had heard in Moʹab that Jehovah had turned his attention to his people by giving them food.<span id="footnotesource7"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="p4 sb"><span id="pos1045"></span><span id="chapter1_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> She left the place where she had been living with both of her daughters-in-law. As they were walking on the road to return to the land of Judah, <span id="chapter1_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Na·oʹmi said to both of her daughters-in-law: “Go, return, each of you to your mother’s home. May Jehovah show loyal love to you, just as you have shown it to the men who have died and to me. <span id="chapter1_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> May Jehovah grant<span id="footnotesource8"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> that each of you finds security<span id="footnotesource9"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> in the home of your husband.” Then she kissed them, and they wept loudly. <span id="chapter1_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> They kept saying to her: “No, but we will go with you to your people.” <span id="chapter1_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> But Na·oʹmi said: “Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still give birth to sons who could become your husbands? <span id="chapter1_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> Return, my daughters. Go, for I have grown too old to marry. Even if I could hope to find a husband tonight and could also bear sons, <span id="chapter1_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> would you keep waiting for them until they could grow up? Would you refrain from getting remarried for their sakes? No, my daughters, I feel very bitter for you, because the hand of Jehovah has turned against me.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> Again they wept loudly, after which Orʹpah kissed her mother-in-law and departed. But Ruth stuck with her. <span id="chapter1_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> So Na·oʹmi said: “Look! Your widowed sister-in-law has returned to her people and her gods. Return with your sister-in-law.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="p6 sb"><span id="chapter1_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> But Ruth said: “Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you; for where you go I will go, and where you spend the night, I will spend the night. Your people will be my people, and your God my God. <span id="chapter1_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17</sup></strong> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May Jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should separate me from you.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="p7 sb"><span id="pos2729"></span><span id="chapter1_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18</sup></strong> When Na·oʹmi saw that Ruth insisted on going with her, she stopped trying to convince her. <span id="chapter1_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19</sup></strong> And they both continued on their way until they came to Bethʹle·hem. As soon as they arrived in Bethʹle·hem, the whole city became stirred up over them, and women were saying: “Is this Na·oʹmi?” <span id="chapter1_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20</sup></strong> She would say to the women: “Do not call me Na·oʹmi.<span id="footnotesource10"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> Call me Maʹra,<span id="footnotesource11"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me. <span id="chapter1_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> I was full when I went, but Jehovah made me return empty-handed. Why should you call me Na·oʹmi, when it is Jehovah who opposed me and the Almighty who caused me calamity?”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="p8 sb"><span id="page393" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="393" data-before-text="393"></span><span id="chapter1_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> This is how Na·oʹmi returned from the fields of Moʹab, along with her Moʹab·ite daughter-in-law Ruth. They came to Bethʹle·hem at the beginning of the barley harvest.</p>
