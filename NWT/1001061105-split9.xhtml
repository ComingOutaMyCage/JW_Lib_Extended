<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="p72 sb"><span id="pos28631"></span><span id="chapter9_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: <span id="chapter9_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> “I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you, <span id="chapter9_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> and with every living creature<span id="footnotesource75"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote75">*</a> that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth. <span id="chapter9_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> Yes, I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh<span id="footnotesource76"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote76">*</a> be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.”</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="p73 sb"><span id="chapter9_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>am making between me and you and every living creature<span id="footnotesource77"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote77">*</a> that is with you, for all future generations. <span id="chapter9_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. <span id="chapter9_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud. <span id="chapter9_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> And I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living creature of every kind;<span id="footnotesource78"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote78">*</a> and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh. <span id="chapter9_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind<span id="footnotesource79"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote79">*</a> on the earth.”</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="p74 sb"><span id="chapter9_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17</sup></strong> God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”</p>

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="p76 sb"><span id="chapter9_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20</sup></strong> Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard. <span id="chapter9_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself inside his tent. <span id="chapter9_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside. <span id="chapter9_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23</sup></strong> So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="p77 sb"><span id="chapter9_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24</sup></strong> When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him, <span id="chapter9_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25</sup></strong> he said:</p>
<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="p78 sz">“Cursed be Caʹnaan.</p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="p79 sz">Let him become the lowest slave to his brothers.”</p>

<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="p84 sb"><span id="chapter9_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28</sup></strong> Noah continued to live for 350 years after the Flood. <span id="chapter9_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29</sup></strong> So all the days of Noah amounted to 950 years, and he died.</p>
