<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="p41 sb">I replied: “I see a flying scroll, which is 20 cubits<span id="footnotesource16"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote16">*</a> long and 10 cubits wide.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="p42 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> Then he said to me: “This is the curse that is going out over the face of all the earth, because everyone who steals, as written on its one side, has gone unpunished; and everyone who makes a sworn oath, as written on its other side, has gone unpunished. <span id="chapter5_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> ‘I have sent it out,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘and it will enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one who makes a false oath in <span id="page1290" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1290" data-before-text="1290"></span>my name; and it will remain inside that house and consume it and its timbers and its stones.’”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="p43 sb"><span id="pos9324"></span><span id="chapter5_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said to me: “Look up, please, and see what is going out.”</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="p44 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> So I asked: “What is it?”</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="p45 sb">He replied: “This is the eʹphah container<span id="footnotesource17"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote17">*</a> that is going out.” He continued: “This is their appearance in all the earth.” <span id="chapter5_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> And I saw that the round lid of lead was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the container. <span id="pos9703"></span><span id="chapter5_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> So he said: “This is Wickedness.” Then he threw her back into the eʹphah container, after which he thrust the lead weight over its mouth.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="p46 sb"><span id="pos9845"></span><span id="chapter5_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward, and they were soaring in the wind. They had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the container between the earth and heaven. <span id="chapter5_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> So I asked the angel who was speaking with me: “Where are they taking the eʹphah container?”</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="p47 sb"><span id="chapter5_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> He replied: “To the land of Shiʹnar<span id="footnotesource18"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote18">*</a> to build her a house; and when it is prepared, she will be deposited there in her proper place.”</p>
