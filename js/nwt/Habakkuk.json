[["A pronouncement that Ha·bakʹkuk the prophet received in a vision: \n \n","How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, but you do not hear? \n \n\tHow long must I ask for help from violence, but you do not intervene? \n \n","Why do you make me witness wrongdoing? \n \n\tAnd why do you tolerate oppression? \n \n\tWhy are destruction and violence before me? \n \n\tAnd why do quarreling and conflict abound? \n \n","So law is paralyzed, \n\n\tAnd justice is never carried out. \n \n\tFor the wicked surround the righteous; \n\n\tThat is why justice is perverted. \n \n","“Look among the nations and pay attention! \n \n\tStare in amazement and be astounded; \n\n\tFor something will happen in your days \n\n\tThat you will not believe even if it is told to you. \n \n","For here I am raising up the Chal·deʹans, \n\n\tThe ruthless and impetuous nation. \n \n\tThey sweep through vast stretches of the earth \n\n\tTo seize homes not theirs. \n \n","They are frightening and fearsome. \n \n\tThey establish their own justice and authority. \n \n","Their horses are swifter than leopards, \n\n\tAnd they are fiercer than wolves in the night. \n \n\tTheir warhorses gallop forward; \n\n\tTheir horses come from far away. \n \n\tThey swoop down like the eagle rushing to feed. \n \n","All of them come bent on violence. \n \n\tThe assembling of their faces is like the east wind, \n\n\tAnd they scoop up captives like sand. \n \n","They scoff at kings \n\n\tAnd laugh at high officials. \n \n\tThey laugh at every fortified place; \n\n\tThey pile up a dirt ramp and capture it. \n \n","Then they move forward like the wind and pass through, \n\n\tBut they will become guilty, \n\n\tBecause they credit their power to their god.” \n \n","Are you not from everlasting, O Jehovah? \n \n\tO my God, my Holy One, you do not die. \n \n\tO Jehovah, you appointed them to execute judgment; \n\n\tMy Rock, you established them for punishment. \n \n","Your eyes are too pure to look on what is evil, \n\n\tAnd you cannot tolerate wickedness. \n \n\tWhy, then, do you tolerate the treacherous \n\n\tAnd keep silent when a wicked man swallows up someone more righteous than he is? \n \n","Why do you make man like the fish of the sea, \n\n\tLike creeping things that have no ruler? \n \n","All of these he hauls up with a fishhook. \n \n\tHe catches them in his dragnet, \n\n\tAnd he gathers them in his fishing net. \n \n\tThat is why he rejoices greatly. \n \n","That is why he offers sacrifices to his dragnet \n\n\tAnd makes sacrifices to his fishing net; \n\n\tFor by them his portion is rich, \n\n\tAnd his food is choice. \n \n","Will he then keep emptying out his dragnet? \n \n\tWill he go on slaughtering nations without compassion? \n"],["At my guardpost I will keep standing, \n\n\tAnd I will station myself on the rampart. \n \n\tI will keep watch to see what he will speak by means of me \n\n\tAnd what I will reply when I am reproved. \n \n","Jehovah then answered me: \n \n\t“Write down the vision, and inscribe it clearly on tablets, \n\n\tSo that the one reading aloud from it may do so easily. \n \n","For the vision is yet for its appointed time, \n\n\tAnd it is rushing toward its end, and it will not lie. \n \n\tEven if it should delay, keep in expectation of it! \n \n\tFor it will without fail come true. \n \n\tIt will not be late! \n \n","Look at the one who is proud; \n\n\tHe is not upright within himself. \n \n\tBut the righteous one will live by his faithfulness. \n \n","Indeed, because the wine is treacherous, \n\n\tThe arrogant man will not reach his goal. \n \n\tHe makes his appetite as large as the Grave; \n\n\tHe is like death and cannot be satisfied. \n \n\tHe keeps gathering all the nations \n\n\tAnd collecting for himself all the peoples. \n \n","Will not all of these speak a proverb, an allusion, and riddles against him? \n \n\tThey will say: \n \n\t‘Woe to him who accumulates what is not his \n\n\t—For how long?— \n\n\tAnd who makes even greater his own debt! \n \n","Will not your creditors rise up suddenly? \n \n\tThey will wake up and violently shake you, \n\n\tAnd you will become something for them to plunder. \n \n","Because you plundered many nations, \n\n\tAll the rest of the peoples will plunder you, \n\n\tBecause of your shedding men’s blood \n\n\tAnd your violence to the earth, \n\n\tTo the cities and those living in them. \n \n","Woe to the one who makes evil gain for his house, \n\n\tSo as to set his nest on the height, \n\n\tTo escape the grasp of calamity! \n \n","You have plotted shame against your house. \n \n\tBy wiping out many peoples you sin against yourself. \n \n","For a stone will cry out from the wall, \n\n\tAnd from the woodwork a rafter will answer it. \n \n","Woe to the one who builds a city by bloodshed, \n\n\tAnd who establishes a town by unrighteousness! \n \n","Look! Is it not from Jehovah of armies that peoples will work hard to feed the fire, \n\n\tAnd that nations tire themselves out for nothing? \n \n","For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah \n\n\tAs the waters cover the sea. \n \n","Woe to the one who gives his companions something to drink, \n\n\tAdding to it rage and anger, to make them drunk, \n\n\tIn order to look on their nakedness! \n \n","You will be glutted with dishonor rather than glory. \n \n\tYou too—drink and expose your uncircumcised condition. \n \n\tThe cup in the right hand of Jehovah will come around to you, \n\n\tAnd disgrace will cover over your glory; \n\n","For the violence done to Lebʹa·non will cover you, \n\n\tAnd the destruction that terrified the beasts will come upon you, \n\n\tBecause of your shedding men’s blood \n\n\tAnd your violence to the earth, \n\n\tTo the cities and those living in them. \n \n","Of what benefit is a carved image \n\n\tWhen its maker has carved it? \n \n\tOf what benefit is a metal statue and a teacher of lies, \n\n\tEven though its maker trusts in it, \n\n\tMaking worthless gods that are speechless? \n \n","Woe to the one who says to a piece of wood, “Awake!” \n \n\tOr to a speechless stone, “Wake up! Instruct us!” \n \n\tLook! It is overlaid in gold and silver, \n\n\tAnd there is no breath at all within it. \n \n","But Jehovah is in his holy temple. \n \n\tBe silent before him, all the earth!’” \n"],["The prayer of Ha·bakʹkuk the prophet, in dirges: \n \n","O Jehovah, I have heard the report about you. \n \n\tI am in awe, O Jehovah, of your activity. \n \n\tIn the midst of the years bring it to life! \n \n\tIn the midst of the years make it known. \n \n\tMay you remember to show mercy during the turmoil. \n \n","God came from Teʹman, \n\n\tThe Holy One from Mount Paʹran. ( Selah ) \n \n\tHis majesty covered the heavens; \n\n\tWith his praise the earth was filled. \n \n","His brightness was like the light. \n \n\tTwo rays flashed from his hand, \n\n\tWhere his strength was hidden. \n \n","Before him went pestilence, \n\n\tAnd burning fever followed at his feet. \n \n","He stood still and shook the earth. \n \n\tWith a look, he made nations leap. \n \n\tThe eternal mountains were smashed, \n\n\tAnd the ancient hills bowed down. \n \n\tThe paths of long ago are his. \n \n","I saw trouble in the tents of Cuʹshan. \n \n\tThe tent cloths of the land of Midʹi·an trembled. \n \n","Is it against the rivers, O Jehovah, \n\n\tIs it against the rivers that your anger is burning? \n \n\tOr is your fury against the sea? \n \n\tFor you rode on your horses; \n\n\tYour chariots were victorious. \n \n","Your bow is uncovered and ready. \n \n\tThe rods are assigned with an oath. ( Selah ) \n \n\tYou split the earth with rivers. \n \n","Mountains writhed in pain at the sight of you. \n \n\tA downpour of waters swept through. \n \n\tThe deep roared with its voice. \n \n\tIt lifted its hands high. \n \n","Sun and moon stood still in their lofty abode. \n \n\tYour arrows went out like the light. \n \n\tThe lightning of your spear was brilliant. \n \n","You marched through the earth with indignation. \n \n\tYou trampled the nations in anger. \n \n","You went out for the salvation of your people, to save your anointed one. \n \n\tYou crushed the leader of the house of the wicked. \n \n\tIt was exposed from the foundation to the top. ( Selah ) \n \n","You pierced the head of his warriors with his own weapons \n\n\tWhen they stormed out to scatter me. \n \n\tThey were overjoyed to devour an afflicted one in secret. \n \n","Through the sea you trod with your horses, \n\n\tThrough the surging of vast waters. \n \n","I heard and I trembled within; \n\n\tAt the sound my lips quivered. \n \n\tRottenness entered my bones; \n\n\tMy legs beneath me were shaking. \n \n\tBut I quietly wait for the day of distress, \n\n\tFor it is coming upon the people who attack us. \n \n","Although the fig tree may not blossom, \n\n\tAnd there may be no fruit on the vines; \n\n\tAlthough the olive crop may fail, \n\n\tAnd the fields may produce no food; \n\n\tAlthough the flock may disappear from the pen, \n\n\tAnd there may be no cattle in the stalls; \n\n","Yet, as for me, I will exult in Jehovah; \n\n\tI will be joyful in the God of my salvation. \n \n","The Sovereign Lord Jehovah is my strength; \n\n\tHe will make my feet like those of a deer \n\n\tAnd cause me to tread on high places. \n \nTo the director; with my stringed instruments. \n"]]
