[["In the 30th year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiled people by the river Cheʹbar, the heavens were opened and I began to see visions of God.","On the fifth day of the month—that is, in the fifth year of the exile of King Je·hoiʹa·chin—","the word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel son of Buʹzi the priest by the river Cheʹbar in the land of the Chal·deʹans. There the hand of Jehovah came upon him. \n \n","As I was looking, I saw a tempestuous wind coming from the north, and there was a huge cloud and flashing fire surrounded by a bright light, and from the midst of the fire was something that looked like electrum.","Within it were what looked like four living creatures, and the appearance of each one was like that of a human.","Each one had four faces and four wings.","Their feet were straight, and the soles of their feet were like those of a calf, and they were shining like the glow of burnished copper.","They had human hands under their wings on all four sides, and the four of them had faces and wings.","Their wings were touching one another. They would not turn when they went; they would each go straight forward. \n \n","Their faces had this appearance: Each of the four had a man’s face with a lion’s face on the right, a bull’s face on the left, and each of the four had an eagle’s face.","That is how their faces were. Their wings were spread out above them. Each had two wings that were touching one another and two wings covering their bodies. \n \n","They would each go straight forward, going wherever the spirit would incline them to go. They would not turn as they went.","And the living creatures had the appearance of burning coals of fire, and something that looked like torches of bright fire was moving back and forth between the living creatures, and lightning was flashing out from the fire.","And when the living creatures would go forth and return, their movement had the appearance of flashes of lightning. \n \n","As I was watching the living creatures, I saw one wheel on the earth beside each of the living creatures with four faces.","The wheels and their structure appeared to glow like chrysʹo·lite, and the four of them looked alike. Their appearance and structure looked as though a wheel were within a wheel.","When they moved, they could go in any of the four directions without turning as they went.","Their rims were so high that they inspired awe, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.","Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels would move along with them, and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels would also be lifted up.","They would go where the spirit inclined them to go, wherever the spirit went. The wheels would be lifted up together with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures was also in the wheels.","When they moved, these would move; and when they stood still, these would stand still; and when they were lifted up from the earth, the wheels would be lifted up together with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures was also in the wheels. \n \n","Over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an expanse that sparkled like awesome ice, stretched out above their heads.","Under the expanse their wings were straight, one to the other. Each one had two wings for covering one side of their bodies and two for covering the other side.","When I heard the sound of their wings, it was like a sound of rushing waters, like the sound of the Almighty. When they moved, it was like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they would let their wings down. \n \n","There was a voice above the expanse over their heads. (When they stood still, they would let their wings down.)","Above the expanse that was over their heads was what looked like a sapphire stone, and it resembled a throne. Sitting on the throne up above was someone whose appearance resembled that of a human.","I saw something glowing like electrum that was like a fire radiating from what appeared to be his waist and upward; and from his waist down, I saw something that resembled fire. There was a brilliance all around him","like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. That was how the surrounding brilliant light appeared. It was like the appearance of the glory of Jehovah. When I saw it, I fell facedown and began to hear the voice of someone speaking. \n"],["He then said to me: “Son of man, stand up on your feet that I may speak with you.”","When he spoke to me, spirit came into me and made me stand up on my feet so that I could hear the One speaking to me. \n \n","He went on to say to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me. They and their forefathers have transgressed against me down to this very day.","I am sending you to sons who are defiant and hardhearted, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.’","As for them, whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will certainly know that a prophet was among them. \n \n","“But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and do not be afraid of their words, although you are surrounded by briars and thorns and are dwelling among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, and do not be terrified by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.","You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or not, for they are a rebellious people. \n \n","“But you, son of man, listen to what I am telling you. Do not become rebellious like this rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.” \n \n","When I looked, I saw a hand stretched out to me, and in it I saw a written scroll.","When he spread it out before me, it had writing on both front and back. Dirges and mourning and wailing were written on it. \n"],["Then he said to me: “Son of man, eat what is before you. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” \n \n","So I opened my mouth, and he made me eat this scroll.","He went on to say to me: “Son of man, eat this scroll that I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.” So I began to eat it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. \n \n","He said to me: “Son of man, go in among the house of Israel and speak my words to them.","For you are not being sent to a people who speak an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel.","You are not being sent to many peoples speaking an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue, whose words you cannot understand. If I would send you to them, they would listen to you.","But the house of Israel will refuse to listen to you, for they do not want to listen to me. All those of the house of Israel are hardheaded and hardhearted.","Look! I have made your face exactly as hard as their faces and your forehead exactly as hard as their foreheads.","I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or be terrified by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.” \n \n","He went on to say to me: “Son of man, take to heart and listen to all my words that I speak to you.","Go in among the exiles of your people and speak to them. Tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.” \n \n","A spirit then carried me along and I heard behind me a great rumbling sound that said: “May the glory of Jehovah be praised from his place.”","There was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they were brushing against one another, and the sound of the wheels next to them, and the sound of a great rumbling.","And the spirit carried me along and took me, and I went in bitterness and in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah rested strongly on me.","So I went to the exiled people at Tel-aʹbib, who were dwelling by the river Cheʹbar, and I stayed there where they were dwelling; and in a dazed condition, I stayed among them for seven days. \n \n","At the end of seven days the word of Jehovah came to me: \n \n","“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman to the house of Israel; and when you hear a word from my mouth, you must warn them from me.","When I say to someone wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ but you do not warn him, and you fail to speak in order to warn the wicked one to turn from his wicked course so that he may stay alive, he will die for his error because he is wicked, but I will ask his blood back from you.","But if you warn someone wicked and he does not turn back from his wickedness and from his wicked course, he will die for his error, but you will certainly save your own life.","But when someone righteous abandons his righteousness and does what is wrong, I will put a stumbling block before him and he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die for his sin and his righteous acts will not be remembered, but I will ask his blood back from you.","But if you have warned the righteous one not to sin, and he does not sin, he will surely keep alive because he was warned, and you will have saved your own life.” \n \n","The hand of Jehovah came upon me there, and he said to me: “Get up, go to the valley plain, and I will speak with you there.”","So I got up and went to the valley plain, and look! the glory of Jehovah was there, like the glory that I saw by the river Cheʹbar, and I fell facedown.","Then spirit entered into me and made me stand up on my feet, and he spoke to me and said: \n \n“Go, shut yourself inside your house.","As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you with them so that you cannot go out among them.","And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will become mute, unable to reprove them, because they are a rebellious house.","But when I speak with you I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.’ Let the one listening listen, and let the one refusing to listen refuse, because they are a rebellious house. \n"],["“And you, son of man, take a brick and put it in front of you. Engrave on it a city—Jerusalem.","Lay siege to it, build a siege wall against it, raise up a siege rampart against it, set up camps against it, and surround it with battering rams.","Take an iron griddle and place it as an iron wall between you and the city. Then set your face against it, and it will be under siege; you are to besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel. \n \n","“Then you should lie on your left side and lay the guilt of the house of Israel on yourself. You will carry their guilt for the number of days that you lie on your side.","And I will impose on you 390 days, corresponding to the years of their guilt, and you will carry the guilt of the house of Israel.","And you must complete them. \n \n“Then for a second time you will lie down, on your right side, and you will carry the guilt of the house of Judah for 40 days. A day for a year, a day for a year, is what I have given you.","And you will turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and you must prophesy against it. \n \n","“Look! I will tie you with ropes so that you cannot turn from your one side to your other side until you have completed the days of your siege. \n \n","“And you should take wheat, barley, broad beans, lentils, millet, and spelt and put them in one container and make them into bread for yourself. For the number of the days that you are lying on your side, 390 days, you will eat it.","You will weigh out and eat 20 shekels of food per day. You will eat it at set times. \n \n","“And you will drink water by measure, a sixth of a hin. You will drink it at set times. \n \n","“You will eat it as you would a round barley loaf; you will bake it before their eyes, using dried human excrement as fuel.”","Jehovah went on to say: “This is how the Israelites will eat their bread—unclean—among the nations where I will disperse them.” \n \n","I then said: “Not that, Sovereign Lord Jehovah! From my youth until now, I have not been defiled by eating meat from an animal found dead or a torn animal, and no unclean meat has entered my mouth.” \n \n","So he said to me: “All right, I will allow you to use cattle manure instead of human excrement, and you will bake your bread over it.”","He then said to me: “Son of man, here I am cutting off the food supply in Jerusalem, and with great anxiety they will eat their bread ration by weight, and in horror they will drink their water ration by measure.","This will happen so that lacking bread and water, they may look in shock at one another and waste away because of their error. \n"],["“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword for yourself to use as a barber’s razor. Shave your head and your beard, and then take scales to weigh and divide the hair into portions.","You will burn a third of it in the fire inside the city when the days of the siege are completed. Then you will take another third and strike it with the sword all around the city, and the last third you will scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them. \n \n","“You must also take a few strands of them and wrap them up in the folds of your garment.","And take some more of them and throw them into the fire and incinerate them. From this a fire will spread to all the house of Israel. \n \n","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, with lands all around her.","But she has rebelled against my judicial decisions and my statutes, acting more wickedly than the nations and the lands all around her. For they have rejected my judicial decisions, and they did not walk in my statutes.’ \n \n","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Because you were more troublesome than the nations all around you and you did not walk in my statutes or carry out my judicial decisions but, instead, you followed the judicial decisions of the nations all around you,","this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Here I am against you, O city, and I myself will execute judgment in your midst before the eyes of the nations.","I will do in you what I have never done before, and the likes of which I will not do again, because of all your detestable practices. \n \n","“‘“So fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers, and I will execute judgment among you and scatter all the rest of you in every direction.”’ \n \n","“‘Therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘because it was my sanctuary that you defiled with all your disgusting idols and with all your detestable practices, I will also reject you; my eye will not feel sorry, and I will show no compassion.","A third of you will die by the pestilence or perish in your midst by famine. Another third will fall all around you by the sword. And I will scatter the last third in every direction, and I will draw a sword to chase after them.","Then my anger will come to an end, and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be satisfied. And they will have to know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my insistence on exclusive devotion, when I have finished unleashing my wrath against them. \n \n","“‘I will make you a devastated place and an object of reproach among the surrounding nations and in the eyes of everyone passing by.","You will become an object of reproach and scorn, a warning example and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute judgment on you in anger and in wrath and with furious punishments. I, Jehovah, have spoken. \n \n","“‘I will send against them the deadly arrows of famine to destroy them. The arrows that I send will bring you to ruin. I will make the famine worse for you by cutting off your food supply.","I will send against you famine and vicious wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children. Pestilence and bloodshed will overwhelm you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.’” \n"],["The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, turn your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.","You must say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the mountains, to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys: “Look! I will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.","Your altars will be demolished, your incense stands will be broken, and I will throw your slain ones down before your disgusting idols.","I will throw the carcasses of the people of Israel before their disgusting idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.","In all the places where you dwell, the cities will be devastated and the high places will be demolished and will lie devastated. Your altars will be demolished and shattered, your disgusting idols will perish, your incense stands will be cut down, and your works will be wiped out.","And those slain will fall in your midst, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. \n \n","“‘“But I will leave a remnant, for some of you will escape the sword among the nations when you are scattered throughout the lands.","And those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive. They will realize that I was brokenhearted over their unfaithful heart that turned away from me and at their eyes that are lusting after their disgusting idols. They will be ashamed of and loathe all the evil and detestable things they have done.","They will have to know that I am Jehovah and that my threats to bring this calamity on them were not empty.”’ \n \n","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Clap your hands and stamp your foot and bemoan all the evil and detestable things done by the house of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.","The one far away will die by pestilence, the one nearby will fall by the sword, and whoever escapes these and is left remaining will die by famine; and I will fully unleash my wrath against them.","And you will have to know that I am Jehovah, when their slain lie among their disgusting idols, all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every luxuriant tree, and under the branches of big trees where they have made fragrant offerings to appease all their disgusting idols.","I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate, and all their dwelling places will become more desolate than the wilderness near Dibʹlah. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” \n"],["The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“As for you, son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the land of Israel: ‘An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.","The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you, and I will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds.","My eye will not feel sorry for you; nor will I feel compassion, for I will bring upon you the results of your own ways, and you will suffer the consequences of your detestable deeds. And you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’ \n \n","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Look! A calamity, a unique calamity, is coming.","An end is coming; the end will come; it will rouse itself against you. Look! It is coming.","Your turn has come, you who inhabit the land. The time is coming, the day is near. There is confusion and not joyful shouting on the mountains. \n \n","“‘Very soon I will pour out my rage on you, and I will fully unleash my anger against you, and I will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds.","My eye will not feel sorry; nor will I feel compassion. I will bring on you the results of your ways, and you will suffer the consequences of your own detestable deeds. And you will have to know that I, Jehovah, am striking you. \n \n","“‘Look, the day! Look, it is coming! Your turn has come; the rod has blossomed and presumptuousness has sprouted.","Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. Neither they nor their wealth nor their crowds nor their prominence will survive.","The time will come, the day will arrive. Let the buyer not rejoice, and let the seller not mourn, for there is wrath against their whole crowd.","For the seller will not return to what was sold, even if his life is spared, for the vision is against the entire multitude. No one will return, and because of his error, no one will preserve his life. \n \n","“‘They have blown the trumpet, and everyone is ready, but no one is going to the battle, because my wrath is against the whole multitude.","The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine are inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword, and famine and pestilence will consume those in the city.","Their survivors who manage to escape will go to the mountains, and like the doves of the valleys, each one will moan over his error.","All their hands will hang limp, and all their knees will drip with water.","They have put on sackcloth, and shuddering has seized them. Everyone will be put to shame, and every head will be bald. \n \n","“‘They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will become abhorrent to them. Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of Jehovah’s fury. They will not be satisfied, nor will they fill their stomachs, for it has become a stumbling block causing their error.","They took pride in the beauty of their ornaments, and they made with them their detestable images, their disgusting idols. That is why I will make it an abhorrent thing to them.","I will give it into the hand of the foreigners for plunder and to the wicked ones of the earth for spoil, and they will profane it. \n \n","“‘I will turn my face away from them, and they will profane my concealed place, and robbers will enter it and profane it. \n \n","“‘Make the chain, for the land is full of bloodstained judgment and the city is full of violence.","I will bring in the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses, and I will put an end to the pride of the strong ones, and their sanctuaries will be profaned.","When their anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none.","There will come disaster upon disaster, and one report after another, and people will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will perish from a priest and advice from the elders.","The king will go into mourning, and the chieftain will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble in terror. I will treat them according to their ways, and I will judge them as they have judged. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” \n"],["And in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah took hold of me there.","As I watched, I saw a form similar to the appearance of fire; there was fire below what appeared to be his waist, and from his waist upward his appearance was bright, like the glow of electrum.","Then he stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by a tuft of hair of my head, and a spirit carried me between the earth and the heavens and brought me to Jerusalem by means of the visions from God, to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north, where the idolatrous symbol of jealousy that incites jealousy stood.","And look! the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance that I had seen in the valley plain. \n \n","He then said to me: “Son of man, please raise your eyes toward the north.” So I raised my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the gate of the altar, was this symbol of jealousy in the entryway.","And he said to me: “Son of man, do you see what terrible, detestable things the house of Israel is doing here, things that make me go far away from my sanctuary? But you will see detestable things that are even more terrible.” \n \n","Then he brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and when I looked, I saw a hole in the wall.","He said to me: “Son of man, please bore through the wall.” So I bored through the wall, and I saw an entryway.","He said to me: “Go in and see the evil, detestable things that they are doing here.”","So I went in and looked, and I saw all sorts of images of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the disgusting idols of the house of Israel; they were carved on the wall all around.","And 70 of the elders of the house of Israel were standing before them, with Ja·az·a·niʹah the son of Shaʹphan standing among them. Each one had his censer in his hand, and the perfumed cloud of incense was ascending.","He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms where his idols are displayed? For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.’” \n \n","And he went on to say to me: “You will see detestable things that are even more terrible that they are doing.”","So he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of Jehovah, and there I saw women sitting and weeping over the god Tamʹmuz. \n \n","And he further said to me: “Do you see this, O son of man? You will see detestable things that are even more terrible than these.”","So he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah. There at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men with their backs to the temple of Jehovah and their faces to the east; they were bowing down to the sun in the east. \n \n","He said to me: “Son of man, do you see this? Is it a trivial thing for the house of Judah to do these detestable things, to fill the land with violence and keep offending me? Here they are thrusting out the branch to my nose.","So I will act in rage. My eye will not feel sorry; nor will I feel compassion. Even though they cry out loudly in my ears, I will not hear them.” \n"],["He then called out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: “Summon those who will bring punishment on the city, each one with his weapon for destruction in his hand!” \n \n","I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces north, each with his weapon for smashing in his hand; and there was one man among them clothed in linen, with a secretary’s inkhorn at his waist, and they came in and stood beside the copper altar. \n \n","Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen, at whose waist was the secretary’s inkhorn.","Jehovah said to him: “Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city.” \n \n","And to the others he said in my hearing: “Go through the city after him and strike. Do not let your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion.","Old man, young man, virgin, little child, and women you should kill off completely. But do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark. You should start from my sanctuary.” So they started with the elders who were in front of the house.","Then he said to them: “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain. Go!” So they went out and struck down people in the city. \n \n","While they were striking them down, I alone was left, and I fell facedown and cried out: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of Israel while you pour out your rage on Jerusalem?” \n \n","So he said to me: “The error of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great. The land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of corruption. For they say, ‘Jehovah has left the land, and Jehovah is not seeing.’","But as for me, my eye will not feel sorry; nor will I show compassion. The consequences of their way I will bring down on their own head.” \n \n","Then I saw the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his waist bringing back word, saying: “I have done just as you have commanded me.” \n"],["As I was watching, I saw above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubs something like a sapphire stone appearing above them, and its appearance resembled a throne.","Then he said to the man clothed in linen: “Enter between the wheelwork, under the cherubs, and fill both your hands with burning coals from between the cherubs and toss them over the city.” So he entered as I watched. \n \n","The cherubs were standing to the right of the house when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard.","And the glory of Jehovah rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and the house gradually became filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.","And the sound of the wings of the cherubs could be heard in the outer courtyard, like the sound of God Almighty when he speaks. \n \n","Then he commanded the man clothed in linen: “Take fire from between the wheelwork, from between the cherubs,” and he entered and stood beside the wheel.","Then one of the cherubs stretched his hand out toward the fire that was between the cherubs. He took some and put it into both hands of the one clothed in linen, who now took it and went out.","The cherubs had what looked like the form of human hands under their wings. \n \n","As I was watching, I saw four wheels beside the cherubs, one wheel beside each cherub, and the wheels appeared to glow like chrysʹo·lite stone.","As for their appearance, the four of them were alike, looking as though a wheel were within a wheel.","When they moved, they could go in any of the four directions without turning, because they would go to the place where the head would face without turning.","Their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, the wheels of all four of them, were full of eyes all around.","As regards the wheels, I heard a voice that called to them, “Wheelwork!” \n \n","Each one had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle. \n \n","And the cherubs would rise—they were the same living creatures that I had seen at the river Cheʹbar—","and when the cherubs moved, the wheels would move alongside them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels would not turn or move from their side.","When these stood still, they would stand still; and when these rose, they would rise with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures was in them. \n \n","Then the glory of Jehovah departed from over the threshold of the doorway of the house and stood still over the cherubs.","The cherubs now lifted up their wings and rose from the earth as I watched. The wheels were also alongside them when they departed. They stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. \n \n","These were the living creatures that I had seen under the God of Israel at the river Cheʹbar, so I came to know that they were cherubs.","All four had four faces, four wings, and what appeared to be human hands under their wings.","And the appearances of their faces were like the faces I had seen by the river Cheʹbar. They would each go straight forward. \n"],["And a spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, the gate that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate I saw 25 men, and among them were Ja·az·a·niʹah the son of Azʹzur and Pel·a·tiʹah the son of Be·naiʹah, princes of the people.","Then He said to me: “Son of man, these are the men who are scheming evil and giving wicked advice in this city.","They are saying, ‘Is it not the time for building houses? The city is the cooking pot, and we are the flesh.’ \n \n","“So prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.” \n \n","Then the spirit of Jehovah came upon me, and he said to me: “Say, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “What you have said is correct, O house of Israel, and I know what you are thinking.","You have caused many to die in this city, and you have filled her streets with the dead.”’”","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘The dead bodies that you have strewn about the city are the flesh, and the city is the cooking pot. But you yourselves will be taken out of it.’” \n \n","“‘A sword you have feared, and a sword I will bring against you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.","‘I will bring you out of her and give you into the hand of foreigners and execute judgment on you.","You will fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.","The city will not be a cooking pot for you, and you will not be the flesh within it; I will judge you at the border of Israel,","and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.

The side chambers around the temple were four cubits wide.","The side chambers were three stories high, one on top of the other, with 30 chambers on each story. There were ledges around the wall of the temple that served as supports for the side chambers, so that the supports did not go into the wall of the temple itself.","On both sides of the temple was a winding passage that widened as it ascended to the upper chambers. The width increased from story to story as one ascended from the lowest story to the uppermost story by passing through the middle story. \n \n","I saw that there was a raised platform all around the temple, and the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six cubits to the corner.","The width of the outside wall of the side chambers was five cubits. There was an open space alongside the structure of the side chambers that was part of the temple. \n \n","Between the temple and the dining rooms was an area that was 20 cubits wide on each side.","There was an entrance between the side chambers and the open space on the north side and another entrance on the south side.

The open area, the building, and its walls were also 100 cubits long.","The width of the front of the temple facing east and the open area was 100 cubits. \n \n","He measured the length of the building that faced the open area in the rear, along with its galleries on both sides, and it was 100 cubits. \n \nHe also measured the outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary, and the porches of the courtyard,","as well as the thresholds, the windows with narrowing frames, and the galleries that were in those three areas.

Its galleries faced each other and were three stories high.","Before the dining rooms was an inner walkway 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long, and their entrances were to the north.","The upper dining rooms of the building were narrower than those in the lower and middle stories, because the galleries took up more of their space.","For they were three stories high, but they had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. That is why more floor space was taken away from them than from the lower and middle stories. \n \n","The outer stone wall near the dining rooms toward the outer courtyard that faced the other dining rooms was 50 cubits long.","For the length of the dining rooms that were toward the outer courtyard was 50 cubits, but for those facing the sanctuary, it was 100 cubits.","The dining rooms had an entryway on the east side leading up to them from the outer courtyard. \n \n","There were also dining rooms inside the stone wall of the courtyard toward the east, near the open area and the building.","There was a walkway before them like that of the northern dining rooms. They were the same length and width, and they had the same exits and layouts. Their entrances","were like the entrances of the dining rooms that were toward the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the walkway, before the adjacent stone wall toward the east, where one could enter. \n \n","Then he said to me: “The dining rooms of the north and the dining rooms of the south that are next to the open area are the holy dining rooms where the priests who are approaching Jehovah eat the most holy offerings.

There will be an abundance of fish, because this water will flow there. The seawater will be healed, and everything will live wherever the stream goes. \n \n","“Fishermen will stand beside it from En-gedʹi clear to En-egʹla·im, where there will be a drying yard for dragnets.
