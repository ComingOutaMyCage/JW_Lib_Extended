Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.” \n \n","Now when the dragon saw that it had been hurled down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.","But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be fed for a time and times and half a time away from the face of the serpent. \n \n","And the serpent spewed out water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river.","But the earth came to the woman’s help, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon spewed out from its mouth.","So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus. \n"],["And it stood still on the sand of the sea. \n \nAnd I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten diadems, but on its heads blasphemous names.","Now the wild beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority. \n \n","I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but its mortal wound had been healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration.","And they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshipped the wild beast with the words: “Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?”","It was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for 42 months.","And it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to blaspheme his name and his dwelling place, even those residing in heaven.","It was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.","And all those who dwell on the earth will worship it. From the founding of the world, not one of their names has been written in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered. \n \n","If anyone has an ear, let him hear.","If anyone is meant for captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. This is where it calls for endurance and faith on the part of the holy ones. \n \n","Then I saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it began speaking like a dragon.","It exercises all the authority of the first wild beast in its sight. And it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first wild beast, whose mortal wound was healed.","And it performs great signs, even making fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind. \n \n","It misleads those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs that it was permitted to perform in the sight of the wild beast, while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the wild beast that had the sword-stroke and yet revived.","And it was permitted to give breath to the image of the wild beast, so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who refuse to worship the image of the wild beast. \n \n","It puts under compulsion all people—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead,","and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.","This is where it calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number, and its number is 666. \n"],["Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who have his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.","I heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was like singers who accompany themselves by playing on their harps.","And they are singing what seems to be a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one was able to master that song except the 144,000, who have been bought from the earth.","These are the ones who did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These are the ones who keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These were bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,","and no deceit was found in their mouths; they are without blemish. \n \n","And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.","He was saying in a loud voice: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of judgment by him has arrived, so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water.” \n \n","Another, a second angel, followed, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality!” \n \n","Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the wild beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,","he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.","And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image and whoever receives the mark of its name.","Here is where it calls for endurance on the part of the holy ones, those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus.” \n \n","And I heard a voice out of heaven say, “Write: Happy are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the spirit, let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right with them.” \n \n","Then I saw, and look! a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. \n \n","Another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary, calling with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud: “Put your sickle in and reap, because the hour has come to reap, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”","And the one seated on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth, and the earth was reaped. \n \n","And still another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary that is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. \n \n","And still another angel emerged from the altar, and he had authority over the fire. And he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: “Put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes have become ripe.”","The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of God’s anger.","The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1,600 stadia. \n"],["And I saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues. These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish. \n \n","And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who are victorious over the wild beast and its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of God.","They were singing the song of Moses the slave of God and the song of the Lamb, saying: \n \n“Great and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity.","Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been revealed.” \n \n","After this I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness was opened in heaven,","and the seven angels with the seven plagues emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests.","One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever.","And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. \n"],["And I heard a loud voice out of the sanctuary say to the seven angels: “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of God on the earth.” \n \n","The first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth. And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image. \n \n","The second one poured out his bowl into the sea. And it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living creature died, yes, the things in the sea. \n \n","The third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water. And they became blood.","I heard the angel over the waters say: “You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, for you have issued these judgments,","because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; they deserve it.”","And I heard the altar say: “Yes, Jehovah God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.” \n \n","The fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun, and to the sun it was granted to scorch the people with fire.","And the people were scorched by the great heat, but they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give glory to him. \n \n","The fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the wild beast. And its kingdom became darkened, and they began to gnaw their tongues because of their pain,","but they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works. \n \n","The sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river Eu·phraʹtes, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the rising of the sun. \n \n","And I saw three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.","They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and they perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. \n \n","“Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one who stays awake and keeps his outer garments, so that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.” \n \n","And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon. \n \n","The seventh one poured out his bowl on the air. At this a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying: “It has come to pass!”","And there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders, and there was a great earthquake unlike any that had occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive and so great was the earthquake.","The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the Great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.","Also, every island fled, and mountains were not found.","Then great hailstones, each about the weight of a talent, fell from heaven on the people, and the people blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, for the plague was unusually great. \n"],["One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me: “Come, I will show you the judgment on the great prostitute who sits on many waters,","with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and earth’s inhabitants were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality.” \n \n","And he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns.","The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and she was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, and she had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality.","On her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth.”","And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. \n \nWell, on seeing her I was greatly amazed.","So the angel said to me: “Why is it that you were amazed? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns:","The wild beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss, and it is to go off into destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth—those whose names have not been written in the scroll of life from the founding of the world—will be amazed when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present. \n \n","“This calls for a mind that has wisdom: The seven heads mean seven mountains, where the woman sits on top.","And there are seven kings: Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet arrived; but when he does arrive, he must remain a short while.","And the wild beast that was but is not, it is also an eighth king, but it springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction. \n \n","“The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings for one hour with the wild beast.","These have one thought, so they give their power and authority to the wild beast.","These will battle with the Lamb, but because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those with him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.” \n \n","He said to me: “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.","And the ten horns that you saw and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire.","For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought, yes, to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast, until the words of God will have been accomplished.","And the woman whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.” \n"],["After this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.","And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a place where every unclean spirit and every unclean and hated bird lurks!","For because of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, all the nations have fallen victim, and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich owing to the power of her shameless luxury.” \n \n","And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.","For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.","Repay her in the way she treated others, yes, pay her back double for the things she has done; in the cup she has mixed, mix a double portion for her.","To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For she keeps saying in her heart: ‘I sit as queen, and I am not a widow, and I will never see mourning.’","That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong. \n \n","“And the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality with her and lived with her in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her when they see the smoke from her burning.","They will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say: ‘Too bad, too bad, you great city, Babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!’ \n \n","“Also, the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, because there is no one to buy their full cargo anymore,","a full cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth; and everything made from scented wood; and every sort of object made from ivory, and from precious wood, copper, iron, and marble;","also cinnamon, Indian spice, incense, perfumed oil, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves, and human lives.","Yes, the fine fruit that you desired has left you, and all the delicacies and the splendid things have vanished from you, never to be found again. \n \n","“The merchants who sold these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn,","saying: ‘Too bad, too bad, the great city, clothed with fine linen, purple, and scarlet and richly adorned with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls,","because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!’ \n \n“And every ship captain and every seafaring person and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea stood at a distance","and cried out as they looked at the smoke from her burning and said: ‘What city is like the great city?’","They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and said: ‘Too bad, too bad, the great city, in which all those who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth, because in one hour she has been devastated!’ \n \n","“Be glad over her, O heaven, also you holy ones and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced his judgment on her in your behalf!” \n \n","And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: “Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.","And the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp, of musicians, of flutists, and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again. And no craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again.","No light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; for your merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth, and by your spiritistic practices all the nations were misled.","Yes, in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.” \n"],["After this I heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: “Praise Jah! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God,","because his judgments are true and righteous. For he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands.”","And right away for the second time they said: “Praise Jah! And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.” \n \n","And the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne and said: “Amen! Praise Jah!” \n \n","Also, a voice came from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.” \n \n","And I heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king!","Let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.","Yes, it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen—for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.” \n \n","And he tells me, “Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.” Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.”","At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning Jesus. Worship God! For the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy.” \n \n","I saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse. And the one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.","His eyes are a fiery flame, and on his head are many diadems. He has a name written that no one knows but he himself,","and he is clothed with an outer garment stained with blood, and he is called by the name The Word of God.","Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.","And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.","On his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. \n \n","I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven: “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God,","so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them, and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.” \n \n","And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army.","And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worship its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur.","But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh. \n"],["And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.","He seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for 1,000 years.","And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were ended. After this he must be released for a little while. \n \n","And I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. Yes, I saw the souls of those executed for the witness they gave about Jesus and for speaking about God, and those who had not worshipped the wild beast or its image and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand. And they came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for 1,000 years.","(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.","Happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years. \n \n","Now as soon as the 1,000 years have ended, Satan will be released from his prison,","and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Maʹgog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea.","And they advanced over the whole earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down out of heaven and consumed them.","And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet already were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. \n \n","And I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.","And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened.

The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.","And the sea gave up the dead in it, and death and the Grave gave up the dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.","And death and the Grave were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.","Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire. \n"],["And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more.","I also saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.","With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people.

Its radiance was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone shining crystal clear.","It had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates, and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel.","On the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.","The wall of the city also had 12 foundation stones, and on them were the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb. \n \n","Now the one who was speaking with me was holding a golden reed as a measure in order to measure the city and its gates and its wall.","And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as its width. And he measured the city with the reed, 12,000 stadia; its length and width and height are equal.","He also measured its wall, 144 cubits according to a man’s measure, at the same time an angel’s measure.","Now the wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass.","The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chal·ceʹdo·ny, the fourth emerald,","the fifth sar·donʹyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysʹo·lite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysʹo·prase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst.","Also, the 12 gates were 12 pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. And the main street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. \n \n","I did not see a temple in it, for Jehovah God the Almighty is its temple, also the Lamb is.","And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp was the Lamb.","And the nations will walk by means of its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.","Its gates will not be closed at all by day, for night will not exist there.","And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.","But anything defiled and anyone who does what is disgusting and deceitful will in no way enter into it; only those written in the Lamb’s scroll of life will enter. \n"],["And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb","down the middle of its main street. On both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit, yielding their fruit each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations. \n \n","And there will no longer be any curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his slaves will offer him sacred service;","and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.","Also, night will be no more, and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for Jehovah God will shed light upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever. \n \n","He said to me: “These words are faithful and true; yes, Jehovah, the God who inspired the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place.","Look! I am coming quickly. Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.” \n \n","Well I, John, was the one hearing and seeing these things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things.","But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers the prophets and of those observing the words of this scroll. Worship God.” \n \n","He also tells me: “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near.","Let the one who is unrighteous continue in unrighteousness, and let the filthy one continue in his filth; but let the righteous one continue in righteousness, and let the holy one continue in holiness. \n \n","“‘Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to repay each one according to his work.","I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.","Happy are those who wash their robes, so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates.","Outside are the dogs and those who practice spiritism and those who are sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying.’ \n \n","“‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to you about these things for the congregations.
