[["And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Siʹnai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year of their coming out of the land of Egypt.

Their names were Elʹdad and Meʹdad. And the spirit began to settle down on them, as they were among those whose names had been written down, but they had not gone out to the tent.

No, I wish that all of Jehovah’s people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them!”","Later Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel. \n \n","Then a wind from Jehovah sprang up and began driving quail from the sea and causing them to fall around the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and they were about two cubits deep on the ground.","So all that day and all night and all the next day, the people stayed up and gathered the quail. No one gathered less than ten hoʹmers, and they kept spreading them all around the camp for themselves.","But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it could be chewed, Jehovah’s anger blazed against the people, and Jehovah began striking the people with a very great slaughter. \n \n","So they gave that place the name Kibʹroth-hat·taʹa·vah, because there they buried the people who showed selfish craving.","From Kibʹroth-hat·taʹa·vah the people departed for Ha·zeʹroth, and they remained at Ha·zeʹroth. \n"],["Now Mirʹi·am and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushʹite wife he had married, for he had taken a Cushʹite wife.","They were saying: “Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?

Both of them went forward.","He then said: “Hear my words, please. If there was a prophet of Jehovah among you, I would make myself known to him in a vision, and I would speak to him in a dream.","But it is not that way with my servant Moses! He is being entrusted with all my house.","Face-to-face I speak to him, openly, not by riddles; and the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees. Why, then, did you not fear to speak against my servant, against Moses?” \n \n","So Jehovah’s anger burned against them, and he departed from them.","The cloud moved away from over the tent, and look! Mirʹi·am was struck with leprosy as white as snow. Then Aaron turned toward Mirʹi·am, and he saw that she was struck with leprosy.","Immediately Aaron said to Moses: “I beg you, my lord! Please do not hold this sin against us! We have acted foolishly in what we have done.","Please, do not let her continue like someone dead, whose flesh is half eaten away at birth!”","And Moses began to cry out to Jehovah, saying: “O God, please heal her! Please!” \n \n","Jehovah replied to Moses: “If her father would spit directly in her face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? Let her be quarantined for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be brought back in.”","So Mirʹi·am was quarantined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not break camp until Mirʹi·am was brought back in.","Then the people departed from Ha·zeʹroth and began camping in the wilderness of Paʹran. \n"],["Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:","“Send out men to spy out the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving to the Israelites.

All the men were heads of the Israelites.","These are their names: of the tribe of Reuʹben, Sham·muʹa the son of Zacʹcur;","of the tribe of Simʹe·on, Shaʹphat the son of Hoʹri;","of the tribe of Judah, Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh;","of the tribe of Isʹsa·char, Iʹgal the son of Joseph;","of the tribe of Eʹphra·im, Ho·sheʹa the son of Nun;","of the tribe of Benjamin, Palʹti the son of Raʹphu;","of the tribe of Zebʹu·lun, Gadʹdi·el the son of Soʹdi;","of the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh, Gadʹdi the son of Suʹsi;","of the tribe of Dan, Amʹmi·el the son of Ge·malʹli;","of the tribe of Ashʹer, Seʹthur the son of Miʹcha·el;","of the tribe of Naphʹta·li, Nahʹbi the son of Vophʹsi;","of the tribe of Gad, Geuʹel the son of Maʹchi.","These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses gave the name Joshua to Ho·sheʹa the son of Nun. \n \n","When Moses was sending them to spy out the land of Caʹnaan, he said to them: “Go up there into the Negʹeb, and then go up into the mountainous region.","You must see what kind of land it is and whether the people who are dwelling in it are strong or weak, few or many,","and whether the land is good or bad and whether the cities they are dwelling in are encampments or fortifications.","And find out whether the land is rich or poor and whether there are trees in it or not. You must be courageous and take some of the fruitage of the land.” Now it was the season of the first ripe grapes. \n \n","So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Reʹhob, near Leʹbo-haʹmath.","When they went up into the Negʹeb, they came to Hebʹron, where A·hiʹman, Sheʹshai, and Talʹmai, the Anʹa·kim, were living. Incidentally, Hebʹron had been built seven years before Zoʹan of Egypt.","When they came to the Valley of Eshʹcol, there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes, which two of the men had to carry on a bar, as well as some of the pomegranates and figs.","They called that place the Valley of Eshʹcol because of the cluster that the Israelites cut down from there. \n \n","At the end of 40 days, they returned from spying out the land.","So they came back to Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paʹran, at Kaʹdesh. They brought back a report to all the assembly and showed them the fruitage of the land.","This is what they reported to Moses: “We entered the land into which you sent us, and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruitage.","Nevertheless, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the fortified cities are very great. We also saw the Anʹa·kim there.","The A·malʹek·ites are dwelling in the land of the Negʹeb, and the Hitʹtites, the Jebʹu·sites, and the Amʹor·ites are dwelling in the mountainous region, and the Caʹnaan·ites are dwelling by the sea and along the Jordan.” \n \n","Then Caʹleb tried to calm the people as they stood before Moses by saying: “Let us go up immediately, and we are sure to take possession of it, because we can surely conquer it.”","But the men who went up with him said: “We are not able to go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are.”","And they kept on giving the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out, saying: “The land that we passed through to spy out is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary size.","And there we saw the Nephʹi·lim, the sons of Aʹnak, who are from the Nephʹi·lim, and in comparison we seemed like grasshoppers, both to us and to them.” \n"],["Then all the assembly raised their voice, and the people continued crying out and weeping all through that night.","All the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly spoke against them, saying: “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!","Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?”","They were even saying to one another: “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt!” \n \n","At this Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground before the whole assembled congregation of the Israelites.","Joshua the son of Nun and Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh, who were among those who spied out the land, ripped their garments apart,","and they said this to all the assembly of the Israelites: “The land that we passed through to spy out is a very, very good land.","If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey.","But you must not rebel against Jehovah, and you must not fear the people of the land, for we will devour them. Their protection has been removed from them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.” \n \n","However, all the assembly talked of stoning them. But Jehovah’s glory appeared on the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel. \n \n","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “How much longer will this people treat me without respect, and how much longer will they not put faith in me in spite of all the signs that I performed among them?","Let me strike them with pestilence and drive them away, and let me make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.” \n \n","But Moses said to Jehovah: “Then the Egyptians, from whose midst you brought this people out by your power, will hear,","and they will speak about it to the inhabitants of this land. These also have heard that you, Jehovah, are among this people and have appeared to them face-to-face. You are Jehovah, and your cloud is standing over them, and you are going before them in the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night.","If you put this people to death all at once, the nations who have heard of your fame would say this:","‘Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’","Please, now, Jehovah, let your power be great, as you promised when you said:","‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love, pardoning error and transgression, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.’","Forgive, please, the error of this people according to your great loyal love, just as you have pardoned this people from Egypt until now.” \n \n","Then Jehovah said: “I forgive them according to your word.","But on the other hand, as surely as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah.","However, not one of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness and yet have kept testing me these ten times and have not listened to my voice","will ever see the land about which I swore to their fathers. No, not one of those treating me without respect will see it.","But because my servant Caʹleb had a different spirit and kept following after me wholeheartedly, I will certainly bring him into the land where he went, and his offspring will take possession of it.","Since the A·malʹek·ites and the Caʹnaan·ites are dwelling in the valley, you should turn back tomorrow and set off for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.” \n \n","Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron:","“How much longer will this evil assembly keep up this murmuring against me? I have heard what the Israelites are murmuring against me.","Say to them, ‘“As surely as I live,” declares Jehovah, “I will do to you just what I have heard you speak!","In this wilderness your corpses will fall, yes, the whole number of you from 20 years old and up who were registered, all of you who have murmured against me.","None of you will enter into the land that I swore to have you reside in except Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh and Joshua the son of Nun. \n \n","“‘“And I will bring in your children, who you said would become plunder, and they will get to know the land that you have rejected.","But your own corpses will fall in this wilderness.","Now your sons will become shepherds in the wilderness 40 years, and they will have to answer for your acts of unfaithfulness until the last one of your corpses falls in the wilderness.","According to the number of the days that you spied out the land, 40 days, a day for a year, a day for a year, you will answer for your errors 40 years, for you will know what it means to oppose me. \n \n","“‘“I, Jehovah, have spoken. This is what I will do to all this evil assembly, those who have gathered together against me: In this wilderness they will come to their end, and here they will die.","The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who caused the whole assembly to murmur against him when they returned with a bad report about the land,","yes, the men who brought back the bad report about the land will be struck down and die before Jehovah.","But Joshua the son of Nun and Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh, who were among those who went to spy out the land, will certainly keep living.”’” \n \n","When Moses spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people began to mourn a great deal.","Moreover, they got up early in the morning and tried to go up to the top of the mountain, saying: “Here we are ready to go up to the place that Jehovah spoke about, for we have sinned.”","But Moses said: “Why are you going beyond the order of Jehovah? This will not succeed.","Do not go up, for Jehovah is not with you; and you will be defeated by your enemies.","For the A·malʹek·ites and the Caʹnaan·ites are there to face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you turned away from following Jehovah, Jehovah will not be with you.” \n \n","However, they presumptuously went toward the top of the mountain, but the ark of Jehovah’s covenant and Moses did not move away from the middle of the camp.","Then the A·malʹek·ites and the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in that mountain came down and struck them, scattering them as far as Horʹmah. \n"],["Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you eventually come into the land that I am giving you to dwell in","and you make an offering by fire to Jehovah from the herd or from the flock—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or a voluntary offering or an offering during your seasonal festivals, in order to make a pleasing aroma to Jehovah—","the one presenting his offering must also present to Jehovah a grain offering of fine flour, a tenth of an eʹphah, mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil.","You should also offer wine as a drink offering, a fourth of a hin, together with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice of each male lamb.","Or for a ram, you should make a grain offering of two tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.","And you should present wine as a drink offering, a third of a hin, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. \n \n","“‘But if you should offer a male of the herd as a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or communion sacrifices to Jehovah,","you should also present together with the male of the herd a grain offering of three tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.","You should also present wine as a drink offering, half a hin, as an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.","This is what should be done for each bull or for each ram or for each of the male lambs or of the goats.","Whatever may be the number that you offer, that is what you should do for each one, according to their number.","This is how every native-born Israelite should present an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. \n \n","“‘If a foreigner who is residing with you or one who has been in your midst for many of your generations should also make an offering by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah, he should do just as you do.","You who are of the congregation and the foreigner who is residing with you will have one statute. It will be a lasting statute for all your generations. The foreign resident should be the same as you before Jehovah.","There should be one law and one judicial decision for you and for the foreigner who is residing with you.’” \n \n","Jehovah went on to say to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I am bringing you","and you eat any of the bread of the land, you should make a contribution to Jehovah.","You should make a contribution of the firstfruits of your coarse meal as ring-shaped loaves. Like the contribution of a threshing floor is the way you should contribute it.","Some of the firstfruits of your coarse meal you should give as a contribution to Jehovah throughout your generations. \n \n","“‘Now if you make a mistake and fail to observe all these commandments that Jehovah has spoken to Moses,","all that Jehovah has commanded you through Moses from the day that Jehovah commanded and onward for your generations,","and if it was done by mistake and without the knowledge of the assembly, the whole assembly must offer one young bull as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to Jehovah, together with its grain offering and its drink offering according to the regular procedure, and one young goat as a sin offering.","The priest will make atonement for the whole assembly of the Israelites, and it will be forgiven them, because it was a mistake, and they brought as their offering an offering made by fire to Jehovah and their sin offering before Jehovah for their mistake.","It will be forgiven the whole assembly of the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst, because it was by mistake on the part of all the people. \n \n","“‘If any person should sin by mistake, then he must present a female goat in its first year for a sin offering.","And the priest will make atonement for the person who made a mistake by an unintentional sin before Jehovah, so as to make atonement for it, and it will be forgiven him.","As for the native-born among the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst, there should be one law for you in the matter of doing something unintentionally. \n \n","“‘But the person who does something deliberately, whether he is native-born or a foreign resident, is blaspheming Jehovah and must be cut off from among his people.","Because he has despised Jehovah’s word and broken his commandment, that person should be cut off without fail. His own error is upon him.’” \n \n","While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man collecting pieces of wood on the Sabbath day.","Those who found him collecting wood brought him up to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly.","They committed him into custody because it had not been specified what should be done to him. \n \n","And Jehovah said to Moses: “The man should be put to death without fail, and the whole assembly should stone him outside the camp.”","So the whole assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him so that he died, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. \n \n","Jehovah went on to say this to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that they must make for themselves fringed edges on the skirts of their garments throughout their generations, and they are to put a blue string above the fringed edge of the skirt.","‘You must have this fringed edge so that you will see it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and observe them. You must not follow your own hearts and eyes, which are leading you to spiritual prostitution.","This will help you remember, and you will observe all my commandments and be holy to your God.","I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to prove myself your God. I am Jehovah your God.’” \n"],["Then Korʹah the son of Izʹhar, the son of Koʹhath, the son of Leʹvi, got up together with Daʹthan and A·biʹram the sons of E·liʹab, and On the son of Peʹleth, of the sons of Reuʹben.","They rose up against Moses along with 250 Israelite men, chieftains of the assembly, chosen ones of the congregation, prominent men.","So they gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them: “We have had enough of you! The whole assembly is holy, all of them, and Jehovah is in their midst. Why, then, should you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?” \n \n","When Moses heard this, he at once fell facedown.","Then he said to Korʹah and to all his supporters: “In the morning Jehovah will make known who belongs to him and who is holy and who should approach him, and whomever he may choose will approach him.","Do this: Take fire holders, Korʹah and all your supporters,","and put fire in them and place incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow, and the man whom Jehovah will choose, he is the holy one. You sons of Leʹvi have gone far enough!” \n \n","Moses then said to Korʹah: “Listen, please, you sons of Leʹvi.","Does it seem to you such a little thing that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel and allowed you to approach him in order to perform the service of Jehovah’s tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them,","and that he brought you near to him along with all your brothers, the sons of Leʹvi? Must you also try to secure the priesthood?","For this reason, you and all your supporters who are gathering together are against Jehovah. As for Aaron, who is he that you should murmur against him?” \n \n","Moses later sent for Daʹthan and A·biʹram the sons of E·liʹab, but they said: “We are not going to come!","Is it so little a thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the wilderness? Now do you also want to make yourself an absolute ruler over us?","As it is, you have not brought us into any land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of field and vineyard. Would you bore out the eyes of those men? We are not going to come!” \n \n","So Moses became very angry and said to Jehovah: “Do not turn to look at their grain offering. Not one donkey have I taken away from them, nor have I harmed one of them.” \n \n","Then Moses said to Korʹah: “Present yourself with all your supporters before Jehovah tomorrow, you and they and Aaron.","Each one should take his fire holder and put incense on it, and each will present his fire holder before Jehovah, 250 fire holders, together with you and Aaron, each with his fire holder.”","So each of them took his fire holder, and they put fire and incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting together with Moses and Aaron.","When Korʹah had gathered his supporters against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting, Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the assembly. \n \n","Jehovah now told Moses and Aaron:","“Separate yourselves from among this group, so that I may exterminate them in an instant.”","At this, they fell with their faces to the ground and said: “O God, the God of the spirit of all people, will one man’s sin cause you to become indignant against the entire assembly?” \n \n","Jehovah then said to Moses:","“Speak to the assembly and tell them, ‘Get away from around the tents of Korʹah, Daʹthan, and A·biʹram!’” \n \n","Then Moses got up and went to Daʹthan and A·biʹram, and the elders of Israel went with him.","He told the assembly: “Move away, please, from the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, so that you may not be swept away in all their sin.”","They immediately moved away from the tents of Korʹah, Daʹthan, and A·biʹram, from every side, and Daʹthan and A·biʹram came out, taking their stand at the entrance of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little children. \n \n","Then Moses said: “By this you will know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these things, that it is not of my own heart:","If these people die a natural death as all men do and if their punishment is the same as that of all mankind, then Jehovah has not sent me.","But if Jehovah does something extraordinary with them and the ground opens and swallows them and everything that belongs to them and they go down alive into the Grave, you will certainly know that these men have treated Jehovah disrespectfully.” \n \n","As soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground beneath them split apart.","And the earth opened and swallowed them up, along with their households and everyone who belonged to Korʹah and all their goods.","So they and all who belonged to them went down alive into the Grave, and the earth covered them over, so that they perished from the midst of the congregation.","All the Israelites who were around them fled at their screaming, for they said: “We are afraid that the earth may swallow us up!”","Then a fire came out from Jehovah and consumed the 250 men offering the incense. \n \n","Jehovah now said to Moses:","“Tell El·e·aʹzar the son of Aaron the priest to take the fire holders out of the fire, for they are holy. Also tell him to scatter the fire some distance away.","The fire holders of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives should be made into thin metal plates to overlay the altar, because they presented them before Jehovah, and they became holy. They should serve as a sign to the Israelites.”","So El·e·aʹzar the priest took the copper fire holders that had been presented by those who were burned up, and beat them to overlay the altar,","just as Jehovah had told him through Moses. It was a reminder for the Israelites that no unauthorized person who is not of the offspring of Aaron should approach to burn incense before Jehovah and that no one should become like Korʹah and his supporters. \n \n","On the very next day, the whole assembly of the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, saying: “You two have put Jehovah’s people to death.”","When the assembly had gathered together against Moses and Aaron, they then turned toward the tent of meeting, and look! the cloud covered it, and Jehovah’s glory began to appear. \n \n","Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting,","and Jehovah said to Moses:","“You men, remove yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may exterminate them in an instant.” At this they fell with their faces to the ground.","Moses then said to Aaron: “Take the fire holder and put fire from the altar in it and put incense on it and go quickly to the assembly and make atonement for them, because indignation has gone out from Jehovah. The plague has started!”","Aaron at once took it, just as Moses had said, and ran into the midst of the congregation, and look! the plague had started among the people. So he put the incense on the fire holder and began making atonement for the people.","He kept standing between the dead and the living, and the scourge eventually stopped.","Those who died from the scourge amounted to 14,700, besides those dead on account of Korʹah.","When at last Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, the scourge had been stopped. \n"],["Jehovah now said to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and take from them one rod for each paternal house, from the chieftains of each paternal house, 12 rods in all. Write the name of each one on his rod.","You should write Aaron’s name on Leʹvi’s rod, because there is one rod for the head of each paternal house.","Deposit the rods in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I regularly present myself to you.","And the rod of the man whom I choose will bud, and I will put a stop to the murmuring of the Israelites against me, which they are also murmuring against you.” \n \n","So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and all their chieftains gave him rods—a rod for each chieftain of a paternal house, 12 rods—and Aaron’s rod was among their rods.","Then Moses deposited the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the Testimony. \n \n","On the next day, when Moses went into the tent of the Testimony, look! Aaron’s rod for the house of Leʹvi had budded and was bringing forth buds and blossoming flowers and bearing ripe almonds.","Moses then brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the people of Israel. They looked at them, and each man took his own rod. \n \n","Jehovah then said to Moses: “Put Aaron’s rod back before the Testimony as something to be kept for a sign to the sons of rebelliousness, so that their murmurings against me may cease and so that they may not die.”","Moses immediately did just as Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so. \n \n","The Israelites then said to Moses: “Now we will die, we will surely perish, we are all going to perish!","Anyone who even comes close to Jehovah’s tabernacle will die! Must we end up dying that way?” \n"],["Jehovah then said to Aaron: “You and your sons and your paternal house with you will be answerable for any error against the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will be answerable for any error against your priesthood.","Also bring near your brothers of the tribe of Leʹvi, your ancestral tribe, so that they may join you and minister to you and your sons before the tent of the Testimony.","They are to fulfill their responsibilities to you and to the entire tent. However, they must not come near the utensils of the holy place and the altar, so that neither they nor you may die.","They will join you and carry out their responsibilities regarding the tent of meeting and all the service of the tent, and no unauthorized person may come near to you.","You must carry out your responsibility toward the holy place and the altar, so that no further indignation may come against the people of Israel.","I myself have taken your brothers, the Levites, from among the Israelites as a gift for you. They are given to Jehovah to care for the service of the tent of meeting.","You and your sons are responsible for your priestly duties pertaining to the altar and what is inside the curtain, and you are to render this service. I have given the service of the priesthood as a gift to you, and any unauthorized person who approaches should be put to death.” \n \n","Jehovah spoke further to Aaron: “I myself put you in charge of the contributions made to me. I have given to you and to your sons a portion of all the holy things contributed by the Israelites as a permanent allowance.","This will be yours out of the most holy offerings made by fire: every offering they make, including their grain offerings and their sin offerings and their guilt offerings that they bring to me. It is something most holy for you and for your sons.","In a most holy place you should eat it. Every male may eat it. It will be something holy to you.","This also belongs to you: the gifts they contribute together with all the wave offerings of the Israelites.

However, you should without fail redeem the firstborn of mankind, and the firstborn of the unclean animals you should redeem.","You should redeem it with the redemption price when it is a month old and up, by the estimated value of five silver shekels, according to the standard shekel of the holy place. It is 20 geʹrahs.","Only the firstborn bull or firstborn male lamb or firstborn goat you should not redeem. They are something holy.

It was there that Mirʹi·am died and was buried. \n \n","Now there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.","The people were quarreling with Moses, saying: “If only we had died when our brothers died before Jehovah!","Why have you brought Jehovah’s congregation into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?","And why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place? It is no place for seed and figs and vines and pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.”","Then Moses and Aaron came from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell with their faces to the ground, and Jehovah’s glory began to appear to them. \n \n","Then Jehovah said to Moses:","“Take the rod and call the assembly together, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the crag before their eyes that it may give its water, and you will bring out water for them from the crag and give the assembly and their livestock something to drink.” \n \n","So Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, just as He had commanded him.","Then Moses and Aaron called the congregation together before the crag, and he said to them: “Hear, now, you rebels! Must we bring out water for you from this crag?”","With that Moses lifted his hand up and struck the crag twice with his rod, and much water began to pour out, and the assembly and their livestock began to drink. \n \n","Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron: “Because you did not show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of Israel, you will not bring this congregation into the land that I will give them.”","These are the waters of Merʹi·bah, where the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah, so that he was sanctified among them. \n \n","Then Moses sent messengers from Kaʹdesh to the king of Eʹdom: “This is what your brother Israel says, ‘You well know all the hardship that we have experienced.","Our fathers went to Egypt, and we dwelled in Egypt many years, and the Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers.","Finally we cried out to Jehovah, and he heard us and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt, and here we are in Kaʹdesh, a city on the border of your territory.","Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through any field or vineyard, and we will not drink the water of any well. We will march on the King’s Road without turning to the right or the left until we pass through your territory.’” \n \n","However, Eʹdom said to him: “You may not pass through our territory. If you do, I will come out with the sword to meet you.”","In turn the Israelites said to him: “By the highway we will go up, and if we and our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We want nothing more than to pass through on foot.”","Still he said: “You may not pass through.” With that Eʹdom came out to encounter him with many people and a strong army.","So Eʹdom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; therefore, Israel turned away from him. \n \n","The people of Israel, the entire assembly, departed from Kaʹdesh and came to Mount Hor.","Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Eʹdom:","“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land that I will give to the Israelites, because you both rebelled against my order regarding the waters of Merʹi·bah.","Take Aaron and his son El·e·aʹzar and bring them up into Mount Hor.","Remove Aaron’s garments and clothe El·e·aʹzar his son with them, and Aaron will die there.” \n \n","So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor before the eyes of all the assembly.","Then Moses removed Aaron’s garments and clothed El·e·aʹzar his son with them. After that Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and El·e·aʹzar came down from the mountain.","When all the assembly saw that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel wept for Aaron for 30 days. \n"],["When the Caʹnaan·ite king of Aʹrad, who dwelled in the Negʹeb, heard that Israel had come by the way of Athʹa·rim, he attacked Israel and carried away some of them as captives.","So Israel made this vow to Jehovah: “If you give this people into my hand, I will without fail devote their cities to destruction.”","So Jehovah listened to Israel’s voice and gave the Caʹnaan·ites over to them, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. Therefore, they named the place Horʹmah. \n \n","As they continued their journey from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea in order to go around the land of Eʹdom, the people became weary of the journey.","And the people kept speaking against God and Moses, saying: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no food and no water, and we have come to hate this contemptible bread.”","So Jehovah sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they kept biting the people, so that many Israelites died. \n \n","So the people came to Moses and said: “We have sinned by speaking against Jehovah and against you. Intercede with Jehovah so that he may remove the serpents from us.” And Moses interceded on behalf of the people.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Make a replica of a poisonous snake and put it on a pole. Then when anyone has been bitten, he will have to look at it in order to keep alive.”","Moses at once made a serpent of copper and put it on the pole, and whenever a serpent had bitten a man and he looked at the copper serpent, he survived. \n \n","After that the Israelites departed and camped in Oʹboth.","Then they departed from Oʹboth and camped in Iʹye-abʹa·rim, in the wilderness that faces Moʹab, toward the east.","From there they departed and camped by the Valley of Zeʹred.","From there they departed and camped in the region of the Arʹnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amʹor·ites, for the Arʹnon is the boundary of Moʹab, between Moʹab and the Amʹor·ites.","That is why the book of the Wars of Jehovah speaks of “Vaʹheb in Suʹphah and the valleys of Arʹnon,","and the descent  of the valleys, which extends toward the settlement of Ar and adjoins the border of Moʹab.” \n \n","Next they went on to Beʹer. This is the well about which Jehovah said to Moses: “Gather the people, and let me give them water.” \n \n","At that time, Israel sang this song: \n \n\t“Spring up, O well!—Respond to it! \n \n","The well that princes dug, that nobles of the people excavated, \n\n\tWith a commander’s staff and with their own staffs.” \n \nThen they went from the wilderness on to Matʹta·nah,","from Matʹta·nah on to Na·halʹi·el, and from Na·halʹi·el on to Baʹmoth.","They went from Baʹmoth on to the valley that is in the territory of Moʹab, on top of Pisʹgah, which overlooks Je·shiʹmon. \n \n","Israel now sent messengers to Siʹhon, the king of the Amʹor·ites, saying:","“Let us pass through your land. We will not turn aside into a field or a vineyard. We will not drink water from any well. We will march on the King’s Road until we pass through your territory.”","But Siʹhon did not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Siʹhon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness and came to Jaʹhaz and began fighting with Israel.","But Israel defeated him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arʹnon to the Jabʹbok, near the Amʹmon·ites, because Jaʹzer borders the territory of the Amʹmon·ites. \n \n","So Israel took all these cities, and they began dwelling in all the cities of the Amʹor·ites, in Heshʹbon and all its dependent towns.","For Heshʹbon was the city of Siʹhon, the king of the Amʹor·ites, who had fought with the king of Moʹab and taken all his land from him as far as the Arʹnon.","That is what gave rise to the taunting proverbial saying: \n \n\t“Come to Heshʹbon. \n \n\tLet the city of Siʹhon be built and firmly established. \n \n","For a fire came out of Heshʹbon, a flame from the town of Siʹhon. \n \n\tIt has consumed Ar of Moʹab, the lords of the high places of the Arʹnon. \n \n","Woe to you, Moʹab! You will be destroyed, O people of Cheʹmosh! \n \n\tHe makes his sons fugitives and his daughters captives of Siʹhon, the king of the Amʹor·ites. \n \n","Let us shoot at them; \n\n\tHeshʹbon will be destroyed as far as Diʹbon; \n\n\tLet us desolate it as far as Noʹphah; \n\n\tFire will spread as far as Medʹe·ba.” \n \n","So Israel began to dwell in the land of the Amʹor·ites.","Moses then sent some men to spy on Jaʹzer. They captured its dependent towns and drove out the Amʹor·ites who were there.","After that they turned and went up by the Way of Baʹshan. And Og the king of Baʹshan came out with all his people to meet them in battle at Edʹre·i.","Jehovah said to Moses: “Do not be afraid of him, for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand, and you will do to him just as you did to Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites, who lived in Heshʹbon.”","So they kept striking him down, along with his sons and all his people, until none of his people survived, and they took possession of his land. \n"],["Then the Israelites departed and camped on the desert plains of Moʹab across the Jordan from Jerʹi·cho.","Now Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor saw all that Israel had done to the Amʹor·ites,","and Moʹab became very frightened of the people, because they were so many; indeed, Moʹab felt sick with fear because of the Israelites.","So Moʹab said to the elders of Midʹi·an: “Now this congregation will devour all our surroundings, just as a bull devours the grass in the field.” \n \nBaʹlak the son of Zipʹpor was king of Moʹab at that time.","He sent messengers to Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor at Peʹthor, which is by the River in his native land.

They have covered the face of the earth, and they are dwelling right in front of me.","Now, please, come and curse this people for me, for they are mightier than I am. Perhaps I can defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I well know that the one whom you bless is blessed and the one whom you curse is cursed.” \n \n","So the elders of Moʹab and the elders of Midʹi·an traveled with the fee for divination in their hands and went to Baʹlaam and conveyed to him Baʹlak’s message.","At that he said to them: “Spend the night here, and I will bring back to you whatever word Jehovah speaks to me.” So the princes of Moʹab stayed with Baʹlaam. \n \n","Then God came to Baʹlaam and said: “Who are these men with you?”","Baʹlaam said to the true God: “Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor, the king of Moʹab, has sent me a message, saying,","‘Look! The people who are coming out of Egypt are covering the face of the earth. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”","But God said to Baʹlaam: “You must not go with them. You must not curse the people, for they are blessed.” \n \n","Baʹlaam got up in the morning and said to the princes of Baʹlak: “Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.”","So the princes of Moʹab departed and returned to Baʹlak and said: “Baʹlaam has refused to come with us.” \n \n","However, Baʹlak again sent princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first group.","They came to Baʹlaam and said to him: “This is what Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor has said, ‘Please do not let anything hinder you from coming to me,","for I will honor you greatly and I will do anything you tell me to do.

But you may speak only the words that I tell you to say.”","So Baʹlaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moʹab. \n \n","But God’s anger blazed because he was going, and Jehovah’s angel stationed himself in the road to resist him. Now Baʹlaam was riding on his donkey, and two of his attendants were with him.","And when the donkey saw Jehovah’s angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it tried to turn off the road into the field. But Baʹlaam began to beat the donkey to make it return to the road.","Then Jehovah’s angel stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with stone walls on both sides.","When the donkey saw Jehovah’s angel, it began to squeeze itself against the wall and it jammed Baʹlaam’s foot against the wall, and Baʹlaam began beating it again. \n \n","Jehovah’s angel now passed by again and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left.","When the donkey saw Jehovah’s angel, it lay down under Baʹlaam, so Baʹlaam became furious and kept beating the donkey with his staff.","Finally Jehovah caused the donkey to speak, and it said to Baʹlaam: “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?”","Baʹlaam replied to the donkey: “It is because you have made a fool of me. If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you!”","Then the donkey said to Baʹlaam: “Am I not your donkey that you have ridden on all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” He replied: “No!”","Then Jehovah uncovered Baʹlaam’s eyes, and he saw Jehovah’s angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand.

I myself came out to offer resistance, because your way is in defiance of my will.","The donkey saw me and tried to turn away from me these three times. Supposing it had not turned away from me! By now I would have killed you and let the donkey live.”","Baʹlaam said to Jehovah’s angel: “I have sinned, because I did not know that it was you standing in the road to meet me. And now if it is bad in your eyes, I will go back.”","But Jehovah’s angel said to Baʹlaam: “Go with the men, but you may speak only the words that I tell you.” So Baʹlaam continued going with the princes of Baʹlak. \n \n","When Baʹlak heard that Baʹlaam had come, he immediately went out to meet him at the city of Moʹab, which is on the bank of the Arʹnon on the border of the territory.","Baʹlak said to Baʹlaam: “Did I not send for you? Why did you not come to me? Did you think I am not able to honor you greatly?”","Baʹlaam replied to Baʹlak: “Well, I have come to you now. But will I be allowed to say anything? I can only speak words that God puts in my mouth.” \n \n","So Baʹlaam went with Baʹlak, and they came to Kirʹi·ath-huʹzoth.","Baʹlak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Baʹlaam and the princes who were with him.","In the morning Baʹlak took Baʹlaam and brought him up to Baʹmoth-baʹal; from there he could see all the people. \n"],["Then Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Build on this spot seven altars, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”","Baʹlak immediately did just as Baʹlaam had said.
