Then Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on all sides of the altar.","As for the pieces of fat of the bull, the fat tail of the ram, the fat covering the internal organs, the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver,","they placed all those pieces of fat on the breasts, after which he made the pieces of fat smoke on the altar.","But the breasts and the right leg Aaron waved back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded. \n \n","Then Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices.","Finally Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people. \n \nJehovah’s glory now appeared to all the people,","and fire came out from Jehovah and began consuming the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they started shouting and they fell with their faces to the ground. \n"],["Later Aaron’s sons Naʹdab and A·biʹhu each took his fire holder and put fire in it and placed incense on it. Then they began offering before Jehovah unauthorized fire, which he had not commanded them to do.","At this a fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, so that they died before Jehovah.","Then Moses said to Aaron: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘I will be made holy among those near to me, and I will be glorified before all the people.’” And Aaron kept silent. \n \n","So Moses called Mishʹa·el and El·zaʹphan, the sons of Uzʹzi·el, Aaron’s uncle, and said to them: “Come here, carry your brothers from in front of the holy place to a place outside the camp.”","So they came forward and carried the men away in their robes to a place outside the camp, just as Moses had told them. \n \n","Moses then said to Aaron and his other sons El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar: “Do not let your heads go ungroomed or tear your garments, so that you may not die and that God may not become indignant against all the assembly. Your brothers of the whole house of Israel will weep over those whom Jehovah has killed by the fire.","You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting or you will die, for Jehovah’s anointing oil is upon you.” So they did according to Moses’ word. \n \n","Then Jehovah said to Aaron:","“Do not drink wine or other alcoholic beverages, you and your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die. It is a permanent statute for your generations.","This is to distinguish between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean,","and to teach the Israelites all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses.” \n \n","Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, his sons who were left: “Take what was left of the grain offering from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire and eat it as unleavened bread near the altar, because it is something most holy.","You must eat it in a holy place, because it is your allowance and the allowance of your sons from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire, for this is what I have been commanded.","You will also eat the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because these things have been given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion sacrifices of the Israelites.","They will bring the leg of the sacred portion and the breast of the wave offering along with the offerings of fat made by fire, in order to wave the wave offering back and forth before Jehovah; and it will serve as a permanent allowance for you and your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.” \n \n","And Moses diligently searched for the goat of the sin offering, and he discovered that it had been burned up. So he grew indignant at El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, Aaron’s sons who were left, and he said:","“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place, since it is something most holy and he has given it to you so that you may answer for the error of the assembly and make atonement for them before Jehovah?","Look! Its blood has not been brought inside the holy place. You certainly should have eaten it in the holy place, just as I was commanded.”","Aaron replied to Moses: “Look! Today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and yet these things happened to me.

The priest will make the valuation according to what the one making the vow can afford. \n \n","“‘If the vow involves an animal that is suitable for offering to Jehovah, whatever may be given to Jehovah will become something holy.","He may not replace it or exchange it with good for bad or with bad for good. But if he should exchange it with one animal for another animal, the original and what is exchanged for it will both become holy.","If it is an unclean animal that may not be presented as an offering to Jehovah, he will then stand the animal before the priest.","The priest will then set its value, as to whether it is good or bad. The value estimated by the priest will stand.","But if he ever wants to buy it back, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to the estimated value. \n \n","“‘Now if a man should sanctify his house as something holy to Jehovah, the priest will then set its value, whether it is good or bad.

It will become the property of the priests. \n \n","“‘If a man sanctifies to Jehovah a field he purchased that is not part of his hereditary property,","the priest will calculate for him the amount of the valuation up until the year of Jubilee, and he will give the estimated value on that day.

Whether bull or sheep, it already belongs to Jehovah.","If it is among the unclean animals and he redeems it according to the estimated value, he should give a fifth of it in addition to it.
