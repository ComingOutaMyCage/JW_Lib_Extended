[["A pronouncement against Ninʹe·veh: The book of the vision of Naʹhum the Elʹkosh·ite: \n \n","Jehovah is a God who requires exclusive devotion and takes vengeance; \n\n\tJehovah takes vengeance and is ready to express his wrath. \n \n\tJehovah takes vengeance against his foes, \n\n\tAnd he stores up wrath for his enemies. \n \n","Jehovah is slow to anger and great in power, \n\n\tBut by no means will Jehovah hold back due punishment. \n \n\tHis path is in destructive wind and storm, \n\n\tAnd the clouds are the dust of his feet. \n \n","He rebukes the sea, and he dries it up; \n\n\tAnd he makes all the rivers run dry. \n \n\tBaʹshan and Carʹmel wither, \n\n\tAnd the blossoms of Lebʹa·non wither. \n \n","Mountains quake because of him, \n\n\tAnd the hills melt. \n \n\tThe earth will be in an upheaval because of his face, \n\n\tAlong with the land and all those dwelling in it. \n \n","Who can stand before his indignation? \n \n\tAnd who can withstand the heat of his anger? \n \n\tHis wrath will be poured out like fire, \n\n\tAnd the rocks will be shattered because of him. \n \n","Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of distress. \n \n\tHe is mindful of those seeking refuge in him. \n \n","With a sweeping flood he will make a complete extermination of her place, \n\n\tAnd darkness will pursue his enemies. \n \n","What will you plot against Jehovah? \n \n\tHe is causing a complete extermination. \n \n\tDistress will not arise a second time. \n \n","For they are interwoven like thorns, \n\n\tAnd they are like those drunk with beer; \n\n\tBut they will be consumed like dry stubble. \n \n","From you will come one who plots evil against Jehovah, \n\n\tGiving worthless advice. \n \n","This is what Jehovah says: \n \n\t“Though they were at full strength and numerous, \n\n\tEven so they will be cut down and will pass away. \n \n\tI have afflicted you, but I will afflict you no more. \n \n","And now I will break his yoke bar from off you, \n\n\tAnd I will tear your bonds in two. \n \n","Jehovah has commanded concerning you, \n\n\t‘Your name will not be perpetuated further. \n \n\tI will do away with the carved images and metal statues from the house of your gods. \n \n\tI will make a grave for you, because you are contemptible.’ \n \n","Look! On the mountains are the feet of one bringing good news, \n\n\tThe one proclaiming peace. \n \n\tCelebrate your festivals, O Judah, pay your vows, \n\n\tFor the worthless one will never pass through you again. \n \n\tHe will be utterly destroyed.” \n"],["One who scatters has come up against you. \n \n\tGuard the fortifications. \n \n\tKeep watch over the road. \n \n\tBrace yourselves and muster all your strength. \n \n","For Jehovah will restore the pride of Jacob, \n\n\tAlong with the pride of Israel, \n\n\tFor the devastators have devastated them; \n\n\tAnd they have ruined their shoots. \n \n","The shields of his mighty men are dyed red, \n\n\tHis warriors are dressed in crimson. \n \n\tThe iron fittings of his war chariots flash like fire \n\n\tIn the day he prepares for battle, \n\n\tAnd the juniper spears are brandished. \n \n","The war chariots race madly through the streets. \n \n\tThey rush up and down the public squares. \n \n\tThey shine like burning torches and flash like lightning. \n \n","He will summon his officers. \n \n\tThey will stumble as they advance. \n \n\tThey rush to her wall; \n\n\tThey set up the barricade. \n \n","The gates of the rivers will be opened, \n\n\tAnd the palace will be dissolved. \n \n","It has been decreed: She is exposed, \n\n\tShe is carried away, and her slave girls moan; \n\n\tThey sound like doves as they beat their breasts. \n \n","Throughout her days Ninʹe·veh was like a pool of waters, \n\n\tBut now they are fleeing. \n \n\t“Stand still! Stand still!” \n \n\tBut no one is turning back. \n \n","Plunder silver, plunder gold! \n \n\tThere is no end to the treasures. \n \n\tIt is stocked with all sorts of precious things. \n \n","The city is empty, desolate, devastated! \n \n\tTheir hearts melt in fear, their knees buckle, their hips tremble; \n\n\tAll their faces are flushed. \n \n","Where is the lair of lions, where the young lions feed, \n\n\tWhere the lion goes out leading its cub, \n\n\tWith no one to make them afraid? \n \n","The lion tore apart enough prey for his cubs \n\n\tAnd strangled for his lionesses. \n \n\tHe kept his dens filled with prey, \n\n\tHis lairs with torn animals. \n \n","“Look! I am against you,” declares Jehovah of armies, \n\n\t“I will burn up her war chariots in smoke, \n\n\tAnd the sword will devour your young lions. \n \n\tI will cut off your prey from the earth, \n\n\tAnd the sound of your messengers will be heard no more.” \n"],["Woe to the city of bloodshed! \n \n\tShe is completely full of deception and robbery. \n \n\tShe is never without prey! \n \n","There is the crack of the whip and the rattle of wheels, \n\n\tThe dashing horse and the bounding chariot. \n \n","The mounted horseman, the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, \n\n\tThe multitude of the slain and the heaps of carcasses \n\n\t—There is no end to the dead bodies. \n \n\tThey keep stumbling over the dead bodies. \n \n","This is because of the many acts of prostitution of the prostitute, \n\n\tShe who is attractive and charming, a mistress of sorceries, \n\n\tWho ensnares nations by her prostitution and families by her sorceries. \n \n","“Look! I am against you,” declares Jehovah of armies, \n\n\t“I will lift your skirts up over your face; \n\n\tI will cause nations to see your nakedness, \n\n\tAnd kingdoms your disgrace. \n \n","And I will throw filth on you \n\n\tAnd make you despicable; \n\n\tI will make a spectacle of you. \n \n","Everyone who sees you will flee from you and say, \n\n\t‘Ninʹe·veh has been devastated! \n \n\tWho will sympathize with her?’ \n \n\tWhere will I find comforters for you? \n \n","Are you better than No-aʹmon, which sat by the Nile canals? \n \n\tWaters surrounded her; \n\n\tHer wealth was the sea and her wall was the sea. \n \n","E·thi·oʹpi·a was her source of boundless strength, also Egypt. \n \n\tPut and the Libʹy·ans were your helpers. \n \n","But even she became an exile; \n\n\tShe went into captivity. \n \n\tHer children also were dashed to pieces on every street corner. \n \n\tThey cast lots over her honored men, \n\n\tAnd all her great men have been bound with fetters. \n \n","You will also become drunk; \n\n\tYou will go into hiding. \n \n\tYou will seek refuge from the enemy. \n \n","All your fortifications are like fig trees with the first ripe fruits; \n\n\tIf they are shaken, they will fall into the mouth of devourers. \n \n","Look! Your troops are like women in your midst. \n \n\tThe gates of your land will be wide open for your enemies. \n \n\tFire will consume the bars of your gates. \n \n","Draw water for the siege! \n \n\tStrengthen your fortifications. \n \n\tGo down into the mire and tread the clay; \n\n\tGrab hold of the brick mold. \n \n","Even there fire will consume you. \n \n\tA sword will cut you down. \n \n\tIt will devour you as the young locusts do. \n \n\tMake yourself as numerous as the young locusts! \n \n\tYes, make yourself as numerous as the locusts! \n \n","You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. \n \n\tThe young locust strips off its skin and flies away. \n \n","Your guards are like the locust, \n\n\tAnd your officers like a locust swarm. \n \n\tThey camp in the stone pens on a cold day, \n\n\tBut when the sun shines, they fly away; \n\n\tAnd no one knows where they are. \n \n","Your shepherds are drowsy, O king of As·syrʹi·a; \n\n\tYour nobles stay in their residences. \n \n\tYour people are scattered on the mountains, \n\n\tAnd no one is gathering them together. \n \n","There is no relief for your catastrophe. \n \n\tYour wound is beyond healing. \n \n\tAll those hearing the report about you will clap their hands; \n\n\tFor who has not suffered from your relentless cruelty?” \n"]]
