[["There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was an upright man of integrity; he feared God and shunned what was bad.","Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.","His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys, along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East. \n \n","Each of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.","After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For Job said: “Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is what Job would always do. \n \n","Now the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them. \n \n","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.”","And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.”","At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?","Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in the land.","But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.”","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah. \n \n","Now on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,","a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them","when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n \n","While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “Fire from God fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n \n","While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “The Chal·deʹans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n \n","While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house.","Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” \n \n","At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down","and said: \n \n\t“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, \n\n\tAnd naked I will return. \n \n\tJehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away. \n \n\tLet the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.” \n \n","In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong. \n"],["Afterward the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them to take his station before Jehovah. \n \n","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.”","And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad. He is still holding firmly to his integrity, even though you try to incite me against him to destroy him for no reason.”","But Satan answered Jehovah: “Skin for skin. A man will give everything that he has for his life.","But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” \n \n","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! He is in your hand! Only do not take his life!”","So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.","And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself, and he was sitting among the ashes. \n \n","Finally his wife said to him: “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God and die!”","But he said to her: “You are talking like one of the senseless women. Should we accept only what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?” In all of this, Job did not sin with his lips. \n \n","Three companions of Job heard about all the calamities that had come upon him, and each came from his own place—Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite, Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite, and Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite. So they agreed to meet together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him.","When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. They began to weep loudly and to rip their garments apart, and they threw dust into the air and onto their heads.","Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great. \n"],["It was after this that Job began to speak and to curse the day of his birth.","Job said: \n \n","“Let the day perish on which I was born, \n\n\tAlso the night when someone said: ‘A man has been conceived!’ \n \n","Let that day be darkness. \n \n\tLet God above show no concern for it; \n\n\tLet no light shine upon it. \n \n","Let the deepest darkness reclaim it. \n \n\tLet a rain cloud settle over it. \n \n\tLet whatever darkens the day terrify it. \n \n","That night—let the gloom seize it; \n\n\tLet it not rejoice among the days of a year, \n\n\tAnd let it not enter among the number of the months. \n \n","Indeed!

\n \n\tWill you condemn me so that you may be right? \n \n","Do you have an arm as powerful as the true God’s, \n\n\tOr can your voice thunder like his? \n \n","Adorn yourself, please, with glory and majesty; \n\n\tClothe yourself with dignity and splendor. \n \n","Release the fury of your anger; \n\n\tLook at everyone who is haughty, and bring him low. \n \n","Look at everyone who is haughty, and humble him, \n\n\tAnd tread down the wicked where they stand. \n \n","Hide them all in the dust; \n\n\tBind them in the hidden place, \n\n","Then even I would acknowledge to you \n\n\tThat your right hand can save you. \n \n","Here, now, is Be·heʹmoth, which I made as I made you. \n \n\tIt eats grass like a bull. \n \n","Look at the strength in its hips \n\n\tAnd the power in the muscles of its belly! \n \n","It stiffens its tail like a cedar; \n\n\tThe sinews of its thighs are woven together. \n \n","Its bones are tubes of copper; \n\n\tIts limbs are like wrought-iron rods. \n \n","It ranks first among the works of God; \n\n\tOnly its Maker can approach it with his sword. \n \n","For the mountains produce food for it, \n\n\tWhere all the wild animals play. \n \n","It lies down under the lotus trees, \n\n\tIn the shelter of the reeds of the marsh. \n \n","The lotus trees cast their shadow on it, \n\n\tAnd the poplars of the valley surround it. \n \n","If the river is turbulent, it does not panic. \n \n\tIt is confident, although the Jordan rushes against its mouth. \n \n","Can anyone capture it while it is watching, \n\n\tOr pierce its nose with a hook? \n"],["“Can you catch Le·viʹa·than with a fishhook \n\n\tOr hold down its tongue with a rope? \n \n","Can you put a rope through its nostrils \n\n\tOr pierce its jaws with a hook? \n \n","Will it make many pleas to you, \n\n\tOr will it speak gently to you? \n \n","Will it make a covenant with you, \n\n\tSo that you may make it your slave for life? \n \n","Will you play with it as with a bird \n\n\tOr tie it on a leash for your little girls? \n \n","Will traders barter for it? \n \n\tWill they divide it up among merchants? \n \n","Will you fill its hide with harpoons \n\n\tOr its head with fishing spears? \n \n","Lay your hand on it; \n\n\tYou will remember the battle and never do it again! \n \n","Any hope of subduing it is futile. \n \n\tThe mere sight of it would overwhelm you. \n \n","No one dares to stir it up. \n \n\tSo who is it who can stand up to me? \n \n","Who has given me anything first that I should repay him? \n \n\tWhatever is under the heavens is mine. \n \n","I will not be silent about its limbs, \n\n\tAbout its mightiness and its well-formed body. \n \n","Who has removed its outer covering? \n \n\tWho will enter its open jaws? \n \n","Who can pry open the doors of its mouth? \n \n\tIts teeth all around are fearsome. \n \n","Its back has rows of scales \n\n\tTightly sealed together. \n \n","Each one fits so closely to the other \n\n\tThat no air can come between them. \n \n","They are stuck to one another; \n\n\tThey cling together and cannot be separated. \n \n","Its snorting flashes out light, \n\n\tAnd its eyes are like the rays of dawn. \n \n","Flashes of lightning go out of its mouth; \n\n\tFiery sparks escape. \n \n","Smoke pours out of its nostrils, \n\n\tLike a furnace fueled with rushes. \n \n","Its breath sets coals ablaze, \n\n\tAnd a flame shoots from its mouth. \n \n","There is great strength in its neck, \n\n\tAnd dismay runs before it. \n \n","The folds of its flesh are tightly joined together; \n\n\tThey are firm, as though cast upon it and immovable. \n \n","Its heart is hard as stone, \n\n\tYes, hard as a lower millstone. \n \n","When it rises up, even the mighty are frightened; \n\n\tIts thrashing causes bewilderment. \n \n","No sword that reaches it will prevail; \n\n\tNor will spear, dart, or arrowhead. \n \n","It regards iron as straw, \n\n\tCopper as rotten wood. \n \n","An arrow does not make it flee; \n\n\tSlingstones turn into stubble against it. \n \n","It regards a club as stubble, \n\n\tAnd it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. \n \n","Underneath, it is like sharp fragments of pottery; \n\n\tIt spreads itself in the mud like a threshing sledge. \n \n","It makes the deep boil just like a pot; \n\n\tIt stirs up the sea like an ointment pot. \n \n","It leaves a glistening wake in its path. \n \n\tOne would think that the deep had white hair. \n \n","There is nothing like it on the earth, \n\n\tA creature made to have no fear. \n \n","It glares at everything that is haughty. \n \n\tIt is king over all the majestic wild beasts.” \n"],["Then Job said in reply to Jehovah: \n \n","“Now I know that you are able to do all things \n\n\tAnd that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you. \n \n","You said, ‘Who is this who is obscuring my counsel without knowledge?’ \n \n\tTherefore I spoke, but without understanding \n\n\tAbout things too wonderful for me, which I do not know. \n \n","You said, ‘Please listen, and I will speak. \n \n\tI will question you, and you inform me.’ \n \n","My ears have heard about you, \n\n\tBut now I do see you with my eyes. \n \n","That is why I take back what I said, \n\n\tAnd I repent in dust and ashes.” \n \n","After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite: \n \n“My anger burns against you and your two companions, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.","Now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt sacrifice for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you. I will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.” \n \n","So Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite, Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite, and Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite went and did what Jehovah had told them to do. And Jehovah accepted Job’s prayer. \n \n","After Job had prayed for his companions, Jehovah removed Job’s tribulation and restored his prosperity. Jehovah gave him double what he had before.","All his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and ate a meal with him in his house. They sympathized with him and comforted him over all the calamity that Jehovah had allowed to come upon him. Each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring. \n \n","So Jehovah blessed the last part of Job’s life more than the beginning, and Job came to have 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 pairs of cattle, and 1,000 female donkeys.","He also came to have seven more sons and three more daughters.","He named the first daughter Je·miʹmah, the second Ke·ziʹah, and the third Kerʹen-hapʹpuch.","No women in all the land were as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers. \n \n","After this Job lived for 140 years, and he saw his children and his grandchildren—four generations.","Finally Job died, after a long and satisfying life. \n"]]
