[["The word of Jehovah that came to Miʹcah of Moʹresh·eth, in the days of Joʹtham, Aʹhaz, and Hez·e·kiʹah, kings of Judah, and that he received in a vision concerning Sa·marʹi·a and Jerusalem: \n \n","“Hear, all you peoples! \n \n\tPay attention, O earth and what fills you, \n\n\tAnd let the Sovereign Lord Jehovah serve as a witness against you \n\n\t—Jehovah from his holy temple. \n \n","For look! Jehovah is going out from his place; \n\n\tHe will come down and tread on earth’s high places. \n \n","The mountains will melt under him, \n\n\tAnd the valleys will split apart \n\n\tLike wax before the fire, \n\n\tLike waters poured down a steep slope. \n \n","All of this is because of the revolt of Jacob, \n\n\tBecause of the sins of the house of Israel. \n \n\tWhat is the revolt of Jacob? \n \n\tIs it not Sa·marʹi·a? \n \n\tAnd what are the high places of Judah? \n \n\tAre they not Jerusalem? \n \n","I will make Sa·marʹi·a a heap of ruins of the field, \n\n\tA place for planting vineyards; \n\n\tI will hurl her stones down into the valley, \n\n\tAnd I will lay bare her foundations. \n \n","All her graven images will be crushed to pieces, \n\n\tAnd all the gifts for which she hired herself out will be burned in the fire. \n \n\tI will devastate all her idols. \n \n\tFor she collected them from the wages of prostitution, \n\n\tAnd they will again become the wages of prostitutes.” \n \n","Because of this I will wail and howl; \n\n\tI will walk barefoot and naked. \n \n\tMy wailing will be like that of jackals, \n\n\tAnd my mourning like that of ostriches. \n \n","For her wound cannot be healed; \n\n\tIt has come as far as Judah. \n \n\tThe plague has spread to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem. \n \n","“Do not announce it in Gath; \n\n\tYou must not weep at all. \n \n\tIn Beth-aphʹrah roll in the dust. \n \n","Cross over in nakedness and shame, O inhabitants of Shaʹphir. \n \n\tThe inhabitants of Zaʹa·nan have not come out. \n \n\tThere will be wailing in Beth-eʹzel, and it will take its support away from you. \n \n","For the inhabitants of Maʹroth have waited for good, \n\n\tBut what is bad has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem. \n \n","Harness the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitants of Laʹchish. \n \n\tYou were the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, \n\n\tFor in you were found the revolts of Israel. \n \n","So you will give parting gifts to Moʹresh·eth-gath. \n \n\tThe houses of Achʹzib were something deceitful to the kings of Israel. \n \n","The conqueror I will yet bring in to you, O inhabitants of Ma·reʹshah. \n \n\tAs far as A·dulʹlam the glory of Israel will come. \n \n","Make yourselves bald and shear off your hair for your cherished children. \n \n\tMake yourselves as bald as an eagle, \n\n\tFor they have been taken away from you into exile.” \n"],["“Woe to those who scheme what is harmful, \n\n\tWho work out evil on their beds! \n \n\tWhen morning light comes they carry it out, \n\n\tBecause it is in the power of their hand. \n \n","They desire fields and seize them; \n\n\tAlso houses, and they take them; \n\n\tThey defraud a man of his house, \n\n\tA man of his inheritance. \n \n","Therefore this is what Jehovah says: \n \n\t‘Here I am devising against this family a calamity from which you will not escape. \n \n\tYou will no longer walk haughtily, for it is a time of calamity. \n \n","In that day people will recite a proverb concerning you, \n\n\tAnd they will bitterly lament over you. \n \n\tThey will say: “We are completely devastated! \n \n\tHe caused the portion of my people to change hands—how he removes it from me! \n \n\tTo the unfaithful one he assigns our fields.” \n \n","So you will have no one to stretch the measuring cord, \n\n\tTo allot the land in the congregation of Jehovah. \n \n","“Stop preaching!” they preach, \n\n\t“They should not preach these things; \n\n\tHumiliation will not overtake us!” \n \n","Is it being said, O house of Jacob: \n \n\t“Has the spirit of Jehovah become impatient? \n \n\tAre these his deeds?” \n \n\tDo not my own words bring good to those walking uprightly? \n \n","But lately my own people have risen up as an enemy. \n \n\tYou openly strip off the majestic ornament with the garment \n\n\tFrom those passing by confidently, like those returning from war. \n \n","You drive the women of my people out from their delightful houses; \n\n\tFrom their children you take away my splendor forever. \n \n","Get up and go, for this is no place of rest. \n \n\tBecause of uncleanness, there is destruction, grievous destruction. \n \n","If a man walks after wind and deception and tells this lie: \n \n\t“I will preach to you about wine and alcoholic drink,” \n \n\tThen he would be just the preacher for this people! \n \n","I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob; \n\n\tI will surely collect the remaining ones of Israel together. \n \n\tIn unity I will place them, like sheep in the pen, \n\n\tLike a flock in its pasture; \n\n\tIt will be noisy with people.’ \n \n","The one breaking out will go before them; \n\n\tThey will break out and pass through the gate and go out by it. \n \n\tTheir king will pass through before them, \n\n\tWith Jehovah at their head.” \n"],["I said: “Hear, please, you heads of Jacob \n\n\tAnd you commanders of the house of Israel. \n \n\tShould you not know what is just?
