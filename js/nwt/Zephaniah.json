[["The word of Jehovah that came to Zeph·a·niʹah son of Cushʹi son of Ged·a·liʹah son of Am·a·riʹah son of Hez·e·kiʹah in the days of Jo·siʹah son of Aʹmon the king of Judah: \n \n","“I will completely sweep away everything from the surface of the ground,” declares Jehovah. \n \n","“I will sweep away man and beast. \n \n\tI will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, \n\n\tAnd the stumbling blocks along with the wicked ones; \n\n\tAnd I will remove mankind from the surface of the ground,” declares Jehovah. \n \n","“I will stretch out my hand against Judah \n\n\tAnd against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, \n\n\tAnd I will wipe out from this place every vestige of Baʹal, \n\n\tThe name of the foreign-god priests along with the priests, \n\n","And those who bow down on the rooftops to the army of the heavens, \n\n\tAnd those who bow down and pledge loyalty to Jehovah \n\n\tWhile pledging loyalty to Malʹcam; \n\n","And those who turn away from following Jehovah \n\n\tAnd who do not seek Jehovah or inquire of him.” \n \n","Be silent before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, for the day of Jehovah is near. \n \n\tJehovah has prepared a sacrifice; he has sanctified those he invited. \n \n","“On the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice I will call to account the princes, \n\n\tThe sons of the king, and all those wearing foreign clothing. \n \n","I will call to account everyone who climbs onto the platform on that day, \n\n\tThose who fill their master’s house with violence and deception. \n \n","On that day,” declares Jehovah, \n\n\t“There will be the sound of an outcry from the Fish Gate, \n\n\tA wailing from the Second Quarter of the city, \n\n\tAnd a loud crash from the hills. \n \n","Wail, you inhabitants of Makʹtesh, \n\n\tFor all the tradesmen have been done away with; \n\n\tAll those weighing out silver have been destroyed. \n \n","At that time I will carefully search Jerusalem with lamps, \n\n\tAnd I will call to account the complacent ones, who say in their heart, \n\n\t‘Jehovah will not do good, and he will not do bad.’ \n \n","Their wealth will be plundered and their houses will be devastated. \n \n\tThey will build houses, but they will not occupy them; \n\n\tAnd they will plant vineyards, but they will not drink wine from them. \n \n","The great day of Jehovah is near! \n \n\tIt is near and it is approaching very quickly! \n \n\tThe sound of the day of Jehovah is bitter. \n \n\tThere a warrior cries out. \n \n","That day is a day of fury, \n\n\tA day of distress and anguish, \n\n\tA day of storm and desolation, \n\n\tA day of darkness and gloom, \n\n\tA day of clouds and thick gloom, \n\n","A day of the horn and of the battle cry, \n\n\tAgainst the fortified cities and against the high corner towers. \n \n","I will cause distress to mankind, \n\n\tAnd they will walk like blind men, \n\n\tBecause it is against Jehovah they have sinned. \n \n\tTheir blood will be poured out like dust, \n\n\tAnd their flesh like the dung. \n \n","Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of Jehovah’s fury; \n\n\tFor by the fire of his zeal the whole earth will be consumed, \n\n\tBecause he will make an extermination, indeed a terrible one, of all the inhabitants of the earth.” \n"],["Gather together, yes, gather yourselves, \n\n\tO nation that feels no shame. \n \n","Before the decree takes effect, \n\n\tBefore the day passes by like chaff, \n\n\tBefore the burning anger of Jehovah comes upon you, \n\n\tBefore the day of Jehovah’s anger comes upon you, \n\n","Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, \n\n\tWho observe his righteous decrees. \n \n\tSeek righteousness, seek meekness. \n \n\tProbably you will be concealed on the day of Jehovah’s anger. \n \n","For Gazʹa will be an abandoned city; \n\n\tAnd Ashʹke·lon will be desolated. \n \n\tAshʹdod will be driven away in broad daylight, \n\n\tAnd Ekʹron will be uprooted. \n \n","“Woe to those who inhabit the seacoast, the nation of Cherʹe·thites! \n \n\tThe word of Jehovah is against you. \n \n\tO Caʹnaan, land of the Phi·lisʹtines, I will destroy you, \n\n\tSo that there will be no inhabitant left. \n \n","And the seacoast will become pasture grounds, \n\n\tWith wells for shepherds and stone pens for sheep. \n \n","It will become a region for the remaining ones of the house of Judah; \n\n\tThere they will feed. \n \n\tIn the houses of Ashʹke·lon they will lie down in the evening. \n \n\tFor Jehovah their God will turn his attention to them, \n\n\tAnd he will gather back their captives.” \n \n","“I have heard the reproach by Moʹab and the insults of the Amʹmon·ites, \n\n\tWho have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory. \n \n","Therefore as surely as I am alive,” declares Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, \n\n\t“Moʹab will become just like Sodʹom, \n\n\tAnd the Amʹmon·ites like Go·morʹrah, \n\n\tA place of nettles, a salt pit, and a permanent wasteland. \n \n\tThe remaining ones of my people will plunder them, \n\n\tAnd the remnant of my nation will dispossess them. \n \n","This is what they will have instead of their pride, \n\n\tBecause they taunted and exalted themselves against the people of Jehovah of armies. \n \n","Jehovah will be awe-inspiring against them; \n\n\tFor he will bring to nothing all the gods of the earth, \n\n\tAnd all the islands of the nations will bow down to him, \n\n\tEach one from its place. \n \n","You E·thi·oʹpi·ans will also be slain by my sword. \n \n","He will stretch out his hand toward the north and destroy As·syrʹi·a, \n\n\tAnd he will make Ninʹe·veh desolate, as dry as a desert. \n \n","Herds will lie down within her, all sorts of wild animals. \n \n\tBoth pelican and porcupine will spend the night among her pillar capitals. \n \n\tA voice will sing in the window. \n \n\tThere will be devastation at the threshold; \n\n\tFor he will expose the cedar panels. \n \n","This is the proud city that was sitting in security, \n\n\tThat was saying in her heart, ‘I am the one, and there is nobody else.’ \n \n\tHow she has become an object of horror, \n\n\tA place for the wild animals to lie down! \n \n\tEveryone passing by her will whistle and shake his fist.” \n"],["Woe to the rebellious, the polluted, the oppressive city! \n \n","She has obeyed no voice; she has accepted no discipline. \n \n\tIn Jehovah she has not trusted; she has not drawn near to her God. \n \n","Her princes within her are roaring lions. \n \n\tHer judges are wolves in the night; \n\n\tThey do not leave even a bone to gnaw until morning. \n \n","Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men. \n \n\tHer priests defile what is holy; \n\n\tThey do violence to the law. \n \n","Jehovah is righteous in her midst; he does no wrong. \n \n\tMorning by morning he makes known his judgments, \n\n\tAs unfailing as the daylight. \n \n\tBut the unrighteous one knows no shame. \n \n","“I destroyed nations; their corner towers were left desolate. \n \n\tI devastated their streets, so that no one was passing through. \n \n\tTheir cities were left in ruins, without a man, without an inhabitant. \n \n","I said, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept discipline,’ \n \n\tSo that her dwelling place might not be destroyed \n\n\t—I must call her to account for all these things. \n \n\tBut they were all the more eager to act corruptly. \n \n","‘So keep yourselves in expectation of me,’ declares Jehovah, \n\n\t‘Until the day when I rise up to take plunder, \n\n\tFor my judicial decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, \n\n\tTo pour out on them my indignation, all my burning anger; \n\n\tFor by the fire of my zeal the whole earth will be consumed. \n \n","For then I will change the language of the peoples to a pure language, \n\n\tSo that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah, \n\n\tTo serve him shoulder to shoulder.’ \n \n","From the region of the rivers of E·thi·oʹpi·a, \n\n\tThose entreating me, the daughter of my scattered ones, will bring a gift to me. \n \n","On that day you will not be put to shame \n\n\tBecause of all your deeds with which you rebelled against me, \n\n\tFor then I will remove the haughty boasters from among you; \n\n\tAnd you will never again be haughty in my holy mountain. \n \n","I will allow a humble and lowly people to remain in your midst, \n\n\tAnd they will take refuge in the name of Jehovah. \n \n","Those remaining of Israel will practice no unrighteousness; \n\n\tThey will not speak a lie, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths; \n\n\tThey will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.” \n \n","Shout joyfully, O daughter of Zion! \n \n\tShout in triumph, O Israel! \n \n\tBe joyful and rejoice with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! \n \n","Jehovah has removed the judgments against you. \n \n\tHe has turned away your enemy. \n \n\tThe King of Israel, Jehovah, is in your midst. \n \n\tYou will fear calamity no more. \n \n","On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: \n \n\t“Do not be afraid, O Zion. \n \n\tDo not let your hands drop down. \n \n","Jehovah your God is in your midst. \n \n\tAs a mighty One, he will save. \n \n\tHe will exult over you with great joy. \n \n\tHe will become silent in his love. \n \n\tHe will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. \n \n","I will gather together those grieving over their absence from your festivals; \n\n\tThey were absent from you because of bearing reproach for her. \n \n","Look! At that time I will act against all those oppressing you; \n\n\tAnd I will save the one limping, \n\n\tAnd I will gather together the dispersed. \n \n\tI will make them an object of praise and fame \n\n\tIn all the land of their shame. \n \n","At that time I will bring you in, \n\n\tAt the time I gather you together. \n \n\tFor I will make you an object of fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth, \n\n\tWhen I gather back your captives before your eyes,” says Jehovah. \n"]]
