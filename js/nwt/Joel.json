[["The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pe·thuʹel: \n \n","“Hear this, you elders, \n\n\tAnd pay attention, all you inhabitants of the land. \n \n\tHas anything like this happened in your days \n\n\tOr in the days of your forefathers? \n \n","Tell about it to your sons, \n\n\tAnd let your sons tell about it to their sons, \n\n\tAnd their sons to the next generation. \n \n","What was left by the devouring locust, the swarming locust has eaten; \n\n\tAnd what was left by the swarming locust, the unwinged locust has eaten; \n\n\tAnd what the unwinged locust has left, the voracious locust has eaten. \n \n","Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! \n \n\tWail, all you wine drinkers, \n\n\tBecause the sweet wine has been taken from your mouths. \n \n","For a nation has come up into my land, mighty and without number. \n \n\tIts teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its jaws are those of a lion. \n \n","It has devastated my vine and turned my fig tree into a stump, \n\n\tStripping them completely bare and tossing them aside, \n\n\tLeaving their twigs white. \n \n","Wail as a virgin wearing sackcloth does \n\n\tFor the bridegroom of her youth. \n \n","Grain offering and drink offering have ceased from the house of Jehovah; \n\n\tThe priests, the ministers of Jehovah, are in mourning. \n \n","The field has been devastated, the ground mourns; \n\n\tFor the grain has been devastated, the new wine has dried up, the oil has failed. \n \n","Farmers are dismayed, vinedressers wail, \n\n\tBecause of the wheat and the barley; \n\n\tFor the harvest of the field has perished. \n \n","The vine has dried up, \n\n\tThe fig tree has withered. \n \n\tThe pomegranate, the palm, and the apple, \n\n\tAll the trees of the field have dried up; \n\n\tFor joy has turned to shame among the people. \n \n","Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests; \n\n\tWail, you ministers of the altar. \n \n\tCome in and spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God; \n\n\tFor grain offering and drink offering have been withheld from the house of your God. \n \n","Proclaim a fast; call for a solemn assembly. \n \n\tGather the elders together, with all the inhabitants of the land, \n\n\tTo the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah for help. \n \n","Woe because of the day! \n \n\tFor the day of Jehovah is near, \n\n\tAnd it will come like a destruction from the Almighty! \n \n","Has not food been taken from before our very eyes, \n\n\tAnd rejoicing and joy from the house of our God? \n \n","The seeds have shriveled under their shovels. \n \n\tStorehouses are desolate. \n \n\tGranaries have been torn down, for the grain has dried up. \n \n","Even the livestock groan! \n \n\tThe herds of cattle wander in confusion, for they have no pasture! \n \n\tAnd the flocks of sheep bear the punishment. \n \n","To you, O Jehovah, I will call; \n\n\tFor fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, \n\n\tAnd a flame has consumed all the trees of the field. \n \n","Even the wild beasts long for you, \n\n\tBecause the streams of water have dried up \n\n\tAnd fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.” \n"],["“Blow a horn in Zion! \n \n\tShout a war cry in my holy mountain. \n \n\tLet all the inhabitants of the land tremble, \n\n\tFor the day of Jehovah is coming!

\n \n","Blow a horn in Zion! \n \n\tProclaim a fast; call for a solemn assembly. \n \n","Gather the people; sanctify the congregation. \n \n\tCollect the old men; gather the children and nursing infants. \n \n\tLet the bridegroom go out from his inner chamber, and the bride from her bridal chamber. \n \n","Between the porch and the altar \n\n\tLet the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep and say: \n \n\t‘Do feel pity, O Jehovah, for your people; \n\n\tDo not make your inheritance an object of scorn, \n\n\tLetting the nations rule over them. \n \n\tWhy should the peoples say, “Where is their God?”’ \n \n","Then Jehovah will be zealous for his land \n\n\tAnd show compassion on his people. \n \n","Jehovah will answer his people: \n \n\t‘Here I am sending to you grain and new wine and oil, \n\n\tAnd you will be fully satisfied; \n\n\tI will no longer make you a reproach among the nations. \n \n","I will drive the northerner far away from you; \n\n\tI will disperse him to a dry and desolate wasteland, \n\n\tWith his vanguard toward the eastern sea \n\n\tAnd his rear guard toward the western sea. \n \n\tThe foul smell from him will ascend, \n\n\tThe stench from him will keep ascending; \n\n\tFor He will do great things.’ \n \n","Do not be afraid, O land. \n \n\tBe joyful and rejoice, for Jehovah will do great things. \n \n","Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, \n\n\tFor the pastures of the wilderness will become green, \n\n\tAnd the trees will bear fruit; \n\n\tThe fig tree and the vine must give their full yield. \n \n","You sons of Zion, be joyful and rejoice in Jehovah your God; \n\n\tFor he will give you the autumn rain in the right amount, \n\n\tAnd he will send upon you a downpour, \n\n\tThe autumn rain and the spring rain, as before. \n \n","The threshing floors will be full of pure grain, \n\n\tAnd the presses will overflow with new wine and oil. \n \n","And I will make compensation to you for the years \n\n\tThat the swarming locust, the unwinged locust, the voracious locust, and the devouring locust have eaten, \n\n\tMy great army that I sent among you. \n \n","You will surely eat to satisfaction, \n\n\tAnd you will praise the name of Jehovah your God, \n\n\tWho has done wonders in your behalf; \n\n\tMy people will never again be put to shame. \n \n","And you will have to know that I am in the midst of Israel \n\n\tAnd that I am Jehovah your God—there is no other! \n \n\tMy people will never again be put to shame. \n \n","After that I will pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh, \n\n\tAnd your sons and your daughters will prophesy, \n\n\tYour old men will dream dreams, \n\n\tAnd your young men will see visions. \n \n","And even on my male slaves and female slaves \n\n\tI will pour out my spirit in those days. \n \n","And I will give wonders in the heavens and on the earth, \n\n\tBlood and fire and columns of smoke. \n \n","The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood \n\n\tBefore the coming of the great and awe-inspiring day of Jehovah. \n \n","And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved; \n\n\tFor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, just as Jehovah has said, \n\n\tThe survivors whom Jehovah calls.” \n"],["“For look! in those days and in that time, \n\n\tWhen I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem, \n\n","I will also gather together all the nations \n\n\tAnd bring them down to the Valley of Je·hoshʹa·phat. \n \n\tI will enter into judgment with them there \n\n\tIn behalf of my people and my inheritance Israel, \n\n\tFor they scattered them among the nations, \n\n\tAnd they divided up my land among themselves. \n \n","For my people they cast lots; \n\n\tThey would trade a boy to hire a prostitute \n\n\tAnd sell a girl for wine to drink. \n \n","Also, what do you have against me, \n\n\tO Tyre and Siʹdon and all the regions of Phi·lisʹti·a? \n \n\tAre you repaying me for something? \n \n\tIf you are repaying me, \n\n\tI will swiftly, speedily bring your repayment on your heads. \n \n","Because you have taken my silver and gold, \n\n\tAnd you have brought my finest treasures into your temples; \n\n","And the people of Judah and Jerusalem you have sold to the Greeks, \n\n\tIn order to remove them far from their territory; \n\n","Here I am rousing them to come from the place where you sold them, \n\n\tAnd I will bring your repayment on your heads. \n \n","I will sell your sons and daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, \n\n\tAnd they will sell them to the men of Sheʹba, to a nation far away; \n\n\tFor Jehovah himself has spoken it. \n \n","Proclaim this among the nations: \n \n\t‘Prepare for war!
