Who are “the chosen angels” mentioned at 1 Timothy 5:21?

The apostle Paul wrote to his fellow elder Timothy: “I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these instructions without any prejudice or partiality.”​—1 Tim. 5:21.
First, we can discuss who can be ruled out as being these angels. Clearly, they are not those of the 144,000. When Paul wrote to Timothy, the resurrection of anointed Christians to heaven had not begun. The apostles and other anointed ones had not yet become spirit creatures, so “the chosen angels” could not refer to them.​—1 Cor. 15:50-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 John 3:2.
Also, “the chosen angels” could not refer to angels who had been disobedient at the time of the Flood. Those angels took sides with Satan and became demons, whom Jesus opposed. (Gen. 6:2; Luke 8:30, 31; 2 Pet. 2:4) In the future, they will be confined to an abyss for 1,000 years and thereafter destroyed along with the Devil.​—Jude 6; Rev. 20:1-3, 10.
“The chosen angels” whom Paul mentioned must have been angels in heaven who supported “God and Christ Jesus,” both of whom are mentioned in the same verse.
There are thousands upon thousands of faithful angels. (Heb. 12:22, 23) We need not think that every one of them has the same assignment at the same time. (Rev. 14:17, 18) Recall that at one point a single angel was tasked with destroying 185,000 armed Assyrians. (2 Ki. 19:35) A number of angels might have been assigned to “collect out from [Jesus’] Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and people who practice lawlessness.” (Matt. 13:39-41) Others might “gather his chosen ones together” to heaven. (Matt. 24:31) And still others are commanded ‘to guard us in all our ways.’​—Ps. 91:11; Matt. 18:10; compare Matthew 4:11; Luke 22:43.





“The chosen angels” mentioned at 1 Timothy 5:21 were likely angels who were assigned special duties in connection with God’s people. In the context, Paul gave wise counsel about elders, who merit respect from the congregation. For their part, elders should handle their responsibilities “without any prejudice or partiality” and should not make a decision or render judgment impetuously. A serious reason for them to follow Paul’s inspired advice is that they are acting “before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels.” It is thus clear that some angels are assigned duties in connection with the congregation, such as providing protection, overseeing the preaching, and reporting to Jehovah.​—Matt. 18:10; Rev. 14:6.
