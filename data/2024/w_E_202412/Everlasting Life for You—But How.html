<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The crowd in Capernaum saw a connection between the loaves Jesus had recently fed them and the manna that Jehovah had provided for their ancestors. In fact, the Scriptures call that manna “bread from heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:40-19:105:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 105:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:31-43:6:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 6:31</a>) Jesus used the manna as the basis for what he taught next. Though the manna was a miraculous provision from God, those who ate it eventually died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:49-43:6:49" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:49</a>) In contrast, Jesus called himself “the true bread from heaven,” “the bread of God,” and “the bread of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:32-43:6:33" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 6:32, 33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:35-43:6:35" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 35</a>) Jesus pointed to a key difference between the manna and himself. He said: “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will <strong><em>live forever.”</em> (Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:51-43:6:51" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>John 6:51</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Those Jews were puzzled. How could Jesus claim to have come down from heaven as “the bread” superior to the miraculous manna that God gave their forefathers? Jesus provided an interesting clue when he said: “The bread that I will give is my <strong><em>flesh.”</em></strong> What could he have meant? We should want to understand because the answer shows how everlasting life is possible for us and our loved ones. Let us see what Jesus meant.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:3-1:9:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 9:3, 4</a>) Jehovah repeated that restriction in his Law to Israel.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:17-40:5:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 5:17-19</a>) So it is unthinkable that he would urge a crowd of Jews to consume his actual <strong><em>flesh</em></strong> or drink the <strong><em>blood</em></strong> in his veins.

Clearly, Jesus was speaking in a figurative sense, as he had done earlier when he told a Samaritan woman: “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:7-43:4:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 4:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:14-43:4:14" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 14</a>)<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Jesus was not suggesting that the Samaritan woman would get everlasting life simply by drinking certain literal <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>water.

He did so to a crowd <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>of Jews in Galilee in 32 C.E. That was about a year before he instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal in Jerusalem. <strong><em>Second,</em></strong> to whom were his words addressed? Most of his listeners in Galilee were more interested in satisfying their temporary physical needs than in satisfying their spiritual needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:26-43:6:26" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 6:26</a>) In fact, when Jesus said something that they found hard to understand, they quickly lost their faith in him. Even some of his disciples stopped following him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:14-43:6:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 6:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:36-43:6:36" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:42-43:6:42" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:60-43:6:60" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 60,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:64-43:6:64" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> 64,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:66-43:6:66" data-bid="21-6" class="b"> 66</a>) Contrast that event with what happened about a year later in 33 C.E. when Jesus instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal. On that occasion, his 11 loyal apostles were with him even though they did not fully understand all that he was teaching. Still, unlike most of those in Galilee, his faithful apostles were convinced that Jesus was the Son of God who had come down from heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:16-40:16:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 16:16</a>) He commended them: “You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 22:28</a>) These two differences alone undermine the claim that Jesus’ words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:53-43:6:53" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 6:53</a> set the pattern for the Lord’s Evening Meal.

In the redeeming power of his <strong><em>flesh</em></strong> and <strong><em>blood</em></strong> that he would, in time, sacrifice. Such faith was essential for those Jews, and it is still essential today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:40-43:6:40" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 6:40</a>) Yes, for us to benefit from Jesus’ flesh and blood, as mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:53-43:6:53" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 6:53</a>, we need to exercise faith in the ransom.

It makes plain Jesus’ kind feelings for people. While in Galilee, he healed the sick, taught about the Kingdom, and made sure that the basic human need for food was filled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:11-42:9:11" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Luke 9:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:2-43:6:2" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> John 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:11-43:6:12" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) More important, he taught that he is “the bread of life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:35-43:6:35" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 6:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:48-43:6:48" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 48</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:53-43:6:53" data-bid="39-1" class="b">John 6:53</a>) In contrast, those who should partake of the bread and the wine show that they have been brought into the new covenant as prospective heirs of the heavenly Kingdom.

It highlights the vital need to exercise faith and thus gain everlasting life.</p>
