<p id="p2" data-pid="2">Have you carefully read this year’s issues of <em>The Watchtower?</em> Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>What example does Jehovah set in how to treat women?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">He treats them impartially, not favoring men over women. God listens to women, being interested in their feelings and concerns. And he trusts them to carry out his work.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="24" href="jwpub://p/E:2024242/1-13:533"><em>w24.01,</em> pp. 15-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>How can we apply</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:7-49:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 5:7</strong></a><strong>, which says: “Do not be sharers with them”?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6">The apostle Paul was warning us not to associate with people who would make it hard for us to stick to God’s standards. Such unwholesome association applies to those we spend time with in person as well as those we interact with on social media.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:2024325/14:240-23:150"><em>w24.03,</em> pp. 22-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>We need to guard against what sorts of false stories?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8">We need to beware of unverified stories from well-meaning friends, unsolicited emails from people we do not know, and feigned interest in the truth by apostates.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:2024366/73-81"><em>w24.04,</em> p. 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>What do we know and what do we not know about how Jehovah will judge King Solomon as well as those who died in Sodom and Gomorrah and in the Flood?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10">We do not know for sure that Jehovah has assigned them to eternal destruction. However, we do know that he has all the facts and has great mercy.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:2024404/10:159-20:450"><em>w24.05,</em> pp. 3-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>God’s being “the Rock” assures us of what? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Deut. 32:4</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12">We can seek <strong>refuge</strong> in Jehovah. He is <strong>reliable,</strong> always keeping his promises. And he is <strong>stable,</strong> staying true to his personality and purposes.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:2024442/1-19:238"><em>w24.06,</em> pp. 26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>What can help you to adjust to a new congregation?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14">Rely on Jehovah, who will help you as he has helped his servants in the past. Avoid making comparisons with your former congregation. Get involved with the new congregation, and strive to develop new friendships.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:2024482/1-17:416"><em>w24.07,</em> pp. 26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>What lessons are conveyed in the three parables found in</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:1-40:25:46" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew chapter 25</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16">The parable of the sheep and the goats emphasizes being faithful and loyal. The parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins stresses being prepared and vigilant. And the parable of the talents highlights the importance of being industrious and diligent.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="30" href="jwpub://p/E:2024566/1-30:75"><em>w24.09,</em> pp. 20-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>How tall was the porch of Solomon’s temple?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:3:4-14:3:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, some ancient manuscripts read “120 cubits,” making the porch 53 meters (175 ft) high. But other authoritative texts read “20 cubits,” making it nine meters (30 ft) tall. The latter seems to fit with the thickness of the temple’s walls.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:2024604/"><em>w24.10,</em> p. 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>What does it mean for a ministerial servant to be ‘a husband of one wife’? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:12-54:3:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1 Tim. 3:12</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:53-43:6:53" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 6:53</a> speaks of the need to eat Jesus’ flesh and drink his blood. Jesus spoke these words in 32 C.E., in Galilee, to Jews who still needed to put faith in him. However, the Lord’s Evening Meal was instituted a year later in Jerusalem. Jesus there spoke to ones with whom he would reign in heaven.​—<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2024684/13-20"><em>w24.12,</em> pp. 10-11</a>.</p>
