These opportunities may come up during a visit to a museum, a botanical garden, or an exhibit at a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses. For example, when touring a museum, whether in person or virtually, you could draw your child’s attention to historical events or artifacts that can strengthen his conviction that the Bible is accurate.

The original Moabite Stone is on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. Also, a replica of the Moabite Stone is on display at “The Bible and the Divine Name” exhibit located at the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Warwick, New York. The Moabite Stone reveals that King Mesha of Moab rebelled against Israel. That is in accord with what the Bible says.

Why? These patterns give evidence of intelligence and wise design. Spiral patterns, for instance, have been studied by scientists for many years. Biophysicist Nicola Fameli explains that when you count the number of spirals found in nature, you discover a certain series of numbers. These make up what is called the Fibonacci sequence. Spiral patterns can be observed in many things, such as the shape of some galaxies, the pattern of nautilus shells, the leaves of plants, and the head of sunflowers.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> As your child learns more in science class at school, he will discover that laws govern the shape of many things. For example, each snowflake is formed according to geometric patterns known as fractals. Fractal patterns are also found in other things in nature. But who made the laws that result in these beautiful patterns? Who is behind the order and careful design we see in nature? The more your child thinks about such questions, the more likely it is that he will be able to develop a strong belief that God created all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 3:4</a>) At some point, you could ask him this question, “If God created us, would it not be reasonable to conclude that he has also given us moral guidance on how to be happy?” You can then point out that such valuable guidance is found in the Bible.</p>

At first, a learner practices tunes that are simple to play. In time, playing music becomes easier. Similarly, a young Christian might at first use a simple approach when sharing his faith with others. For example, he might ask a schoolmate: “Did you know that engineers often copy designs from nature? Let me show you a fascinating video.” After sharing a video from the series <a data-link-type="fallback" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E&amp;pub=ijwwd"><em>Was It Designed?</em></a> he might say: “If a scientist gets credit for a design that already exists in nature, who deserves credit for the original?” Such a simple approach might be enough to stimulate a young person’s interest and leave him open to learning more.</p>
