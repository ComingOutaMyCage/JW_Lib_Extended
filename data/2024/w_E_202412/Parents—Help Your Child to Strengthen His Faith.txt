SONG 135 Jehovah’s Warm Appeal: “Be Wise, My Son”

Parents​—Help Your Child to Strengthen His Faith


“Prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”​—ROM. 12:2.


FOCUS
Practical suggestions on how parents can maintain good communication with their child and help him to strengthen his faith in God and in the Bible.


1-2. How should parents respond to a child who asks questions about our Bible-based beliefs?

Your answer


MANY would agree that being a parent is a full-time job. If you are a parent with a young child, we commend you for working hard to build strong faith in him. (Deut. 6:6, 7) As your child grows up, he may begin asking serious questions about our Bible-based beliefs, including the Bible’s moral standards.
2 At first, you may be worried about your child’s questions. You might even view such questions as a step backward regarding his faith. In reality, however, growing children need to ask questions in order to form their own convictions. (1 Cor. 13:11) So there is no reason to be fearful. You may view all sincere questions your child raises about our beliefs as opportunities to help him to develop his thinking ability.
 3. What will we consider in this article?

Your answer


3 In this article, we will discuss how parents can help their child or children (1) develop their own personal convictions, (2) build appreciation for the Bible’s moral standards, and (3) defend their beliefs. As we do, we will also consider positive aspects of children’s questions and some family activities that may give parents the opportunity to talk about Christian beliefs.
HELP YOUR CHILD DEVELOP HIS CONVICTIONS
 4. What questions might a child have, and why?

Your answer


4 Christian parents recognize that faith in God is not something a child inherits. You were not born with faith in Jehovah. That is also true of your child. Over time a child may wrestle with such questions as: ‘How do I know that there is a God? Can I really believe what the Bible says?’ In fact, the Bible actually encourages us to use our “power of reason” and to “make sure of all things.” (Rom. 12:1; 1 Thess. 5:21) How, though, can you help your child to strengthen his faith?
 5. What can parents do to help their child develop faith in the Bible? (Romans 12:2)

Your answer


5 Encourage your child to prove the truth to himself. (Read Romans 12:2.) When your child asks questions, take the opportunity to show him how to find the answers by using research tools, such as the Watch Tower Publications Index and the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses. In the latter, under the subject “The Bible,” he might look up “Inspired by God” to find evidence that the Bible is not just a good book written by men. Rather, it is “the word of God.” (1 Thess. 2:13) For example, he could research the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh. In the past, some Bible critics claimed that the city of Nineveh never existed. But by the 1850’s, the ruins of this city were unearthed, proving the Bible’s account to be accurate. (Zeph. 2:13-15) For information on how the destruction of Nineveh fulfilled Bible prophecy, he might see the article “Did You Know?” in the November 2021 issue of The Watchtower. By comparing what he learns from our publications with what he learns from encyclopedias and other respected sources, your child will have good reason to increase his faith in what the Bible says.
 6. How can parents stimulate their child’s thinking ability? Give an example. (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Stimulate your child’s thinking ability. Parents have different opportunities to engage in interesting conversations with their child about the Bible or about faith in God. These opportunities may come up during a visit to a museum, a botanical garden, or an exhibit at a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses. For example, when touring a museum, whether in person or virtually, you could draw your child’s attention to historical events or artifacts that can strengthen his conviction that the Bible is accurate. Does your child know that God’s personal name appears on a 3,000-year-old slab of stone known as the Moabite Stone? The original Moabite Stone is on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. Also, a replica of the Moabite Stone is on display at “The Bible and the Divine Name” exhibit located at the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Warwick, New York. The Moabite Stone reveals that King Mesha of Moab rebelled against Israel. That is in accord with what the Bible says. (2 Ki. 3:4, 5) When your child sees with his own eyes evidence of the Bible’s truthfulness and accuracy, his faith will become stronger.​—Compare 2 Chronicles 9:6.

7-8. (a) What can we learn from the beauty and design we see in nature? Give an example. (See also picture.) (b) What questions can help your child to strengthen his belief in a Creator?

Your answers


7 Encourage your child to think about the natural world. While you are walking in the countryside or gardening, draw your child’s attention to the intriguing patterns that can be seen in nature. Why? These patterns give evidence of intelligence and wise design. Spiral patterns, for instance, have been studied by scientists for many years. Biophysicist Nicola Fameli explains that when you count the number of spirals found in nature, you discover a certain series of numbers. These make up what is called the Fibonacci sequence. Spiral patterns can be observed in many things, such as the shape of some galaxies, the pattern of nautilus shells, the leaves of plants, and the head of sunflowers.a
8 As your child learns more in science class at school, he will discover that laws govern the shape of many things. For example, each snowflake is formed according to geometric patterns known as fractals. Fractal patterns are also found in other things in nature. But who made the laws that result in these beautiful patterns? Who is behind the order and careful design we see in nature? The more your child thinks about such questions, the more likely it is that he will be able to develop a strong belief that God created all things. (Heb. 3:4) At some point, you could ask him this question, “If God created us, would it not be reasonable to conclude that he has also given us moral guidance on how to be happy?” You can then point out that such valuable guidance is found in the Bible.

BUILD APPRECIATION FOR THE BIBLE’S MORAL STANDARDS
 9. What might cause a child to question the value of the Bible’s moral standards?

Your answer


9 If your child questions the value of the Bible’s moral standards, try to discern any underlying reasons for the questions. Does he really disagree with the Bible’s moral standards, or is the problem simply that when speaking with others, he does not know how to defend his Christian values? In either case, you can help your child to appreciate the Bible’s moral standards by studying the Enjoy Life Forever! book.b
10. How can you help your child to think about his personal relationship with Jehovah?

Your answer


10 Encourage your child to treasure his personal relationship with Jehovah. As you study the Bible with your child, try to draw him out by using the viewpoint questions and illustrations that are found in the Enjoy Life Forever! book. (Prov. 20:5) For instance, lesson 8 compares Jehovah to a caring friend who gives us reminders that can protect and benefit us. After discussing 1 John 5:3, you might ask, “Knowing that Jehovah is such a good Friend, how should we view what he tells us to do?” That may seem to be a simple question, but asking it might help your child to view God’s laws as evidence of His love.​—Isa. 48:17, 18.
11. How can you help your child to appreciate the value of Bible principles? (Proverbs 2:10, 11)

Your answer


11 Discuss how applying Bible principles benefits us. When you read the Bible or the daily text together, discuss how Bible principles have helped your family. For example, does your child see the benefits of being diligent and honest? (Heb. 13:18) You might also emphasize how applying Bible principles protects us physically and emotionally. (Prov. 14:29, 30) Discussing such principles will likely help your child to appreciate the Bible’s advice even more.​—Read Proverbs 2:10, 11.
12. How does one father help his son to appreciate the practical value of Bible principles?

Your answer


12 Steve, a father in France, explains how he and his wife help their teenage son, Ethan, to see the love that is behind Jehovah’s laws: “We ask him such questions as, ‘Why does Jehovah require that we respect this principle? How does this show that he loves us? What would happen if you did not apply that principle?’” Conversations like these have helped Ethan to make Jehovah’s moral standards his own. Steve adds: “Our goal is to help Ethan to see that the Bible contains wisdom that is far superior to human wisdom.”
13. How can parents train their child to apply Bible principles? Give an example.

Your answer


13 Train your child to apply Bible principles. One opportunity to do so is when your child is assigned to read a book as part of a school project. The book may present the idea that characters who engage in immoral acts or who display outbursts of anger are worthy of imitation. You might encourage your child to think about the actions of the characters in the light of Bible principles. (Prov. 22:24, 25; 1 Cor. 15:33; Phil. 4:8) That may equip him to give a witness to his teacher and fellow students during class discussions of the assigned material.
PREPARE YOUR CHILD TO DEFEND HIS BELIEFS
14. What subject could be intimidating for a young Christian, and why?

Your answer


14 Young Christians may at times lack the confidence to defend their beliefs. They may feel intimidated when the theory of evolution comes up in class. Why? Their teachers may present evolution as an established fact. If you are a parent, how can you help your child to have the confidence to stand firm in his beliefs?
15. What can help a young Christian to be more confident in what he believes?

Your answer


15 Help your child to become more confident in what he believes. Your child does not need to be ashamed because he knows the truth about creation. (2 Tim. 1:8) Why not? The fact is that many scientists also understand that life did not appear spontaneously or by chance. They perceive intelligent and obvious design in the complexity of life. As a result, they do not accept the evolution theory that is commonly presented in schools around the globe. Your child can fortify his own convictions by reflecting on the reasons that persuaded other brothers and sisters to believe that life was created.c
16. How can parents help a child to defend his belief in a Creator? (1 Peter 3:15) (See also picture.)

Your answer


16 Prepare your child to defend his belief in a Creator. (Read 1 Peter 3:15.) You might find it useful to review together articles on jw.org in the series “Young People Ask​—Creation or Evolution?” Then discuss the line of reasoning that your child feels is most persuasive for helping others understand the truth about the Creator. Remind him that he does not need to argue with his schoolmates. Encourage him to use simple logic and reasoning if some are open to a pleasant discussion. For example, a schoolmate might say: “I believe only what I can see, and I have never seen God.” A young Christian could respond: “Imagine that you are walking through a forest far from any human activity and you come upon a functioning well. What would you conclude? If the presence of a well gives clear evidence of intelligent life having made it, how much more so does the existence of the universe!”




Use logic and reasoning when speaking with schoolmates (See paragraphs 16-17)d




17. How can parents encourage their child to look for opportunities to share Bible truth with others? Illustrate.

Your answer


17 Encourage your child to look for opportunities to share Bible truth with others. (Rom. 10:10) You might compare his efforts to talk about his faith with the efforts needed to play a musical instrument. At first, a learner practices tunes that are simple to play. In time, playing music becomes easier. Similarly, a young Christian might at first use a simple approach when sharing his faith with others. For example, he might ask a schoolmate: “Did you know that engineers often copy designs from nature? Let me show you a fascinating video.” After sharing a video from the series Was It Designed? he might say: “If a scientist gets credit for a design that already exists in nature, who deserves credit for the original?” Such a simple approach might be enough to stimulate a young person’s interest and leave him open to learning more.
CONTINUE TO HELP YOUR CHILD STRENGTHEN HIS FAITH
18. How can parents continue to strengthen their child’s faith in God?

Your answer


18 We live in a world dominated by people who have no faith in Jehovah. (2 Pet. 3:3) Therefore, parents, as you study the Bible with your child, encourage him to explore topics that will increase his respect for God’s Word and moral standards. Stimulate his thinking ability by pointing out marvelous facets of Jehovah’s creation. Help him to appreciate the astounding Bible prophecies that have already been fulfilled. And above all, pray with your child and for him. When you do, you can be assured that Jehovah will reward your efforts to help your child strengthen his faith.​—2 Chron. 15:7.
