<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>AT ONE time or another, we have all shed tears. When we go through situations that make us very happy, we might shed tears of joy. Perhaps you cried when something important or special happened to you​—for instance, when your child was born, when you recalled a fond memory, or when you welcomed a dear friend whom you had not seen in years.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> However, all too often, our tears reflect the pain we feel deep in our heart. For example, we might cry when someone sorely disappoints us. We might shed tears when suffering intense pain because of an unrelenting sickness or when mourning the loss of a loved one in death. At such times, we might feel as did the prophet Jeremiah when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians. Jeremiah said: “Streams of water flow from my eyes . . . My eyes weep without ceasing, without pausing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:48-25:3:49" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lam. 3:48, 49</a>.</p>

One of these difficulties was that she was in a bigamous marriage, and her husband’s other wife, Peninnah, despised her.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:1-9:1:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:1, 2</a>) Peninnah relentlessly taunted Hannah about her barrenness. How would you have felt in such a situation?

One thing that helped her was that she went to the center of true worship, the tabernacle. There, possibly somewhere near the entrance to the courtyard of the tabernacle, “she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably.” She begged Jehovah: “Look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:10-9:1:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:10b, 11</a>) Hannah poured out her feelings to Jehovah in prayer.

Perhaps you are grieving the death of a family member or a friend. At such times, it is only natural to want to be alone. But just as Hannah found comfort and encouragement by going to the tabernacle, you can find comfort by attending Christian meetings​—even if you are not feeling your best. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:24, 25</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> As we listen to comforting Bible passages at meetings, Jehovah can help us replace negative thoughts with positive ones. That can help us control our emotions, even if our situation does not immediately improve.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> At our meetings, we also enjoy wholesome association with compassionate fellow believers, whose expressions of concern and love can lift our spirits.

He said: “I still shed tears. Sometimes, I will sit in a corner and just cry. But our meetings have been a true source of encouragement. The beautiful expressions of my brothers and sisters are really soothing to me. No matter how anxious, or worried, I am before I arrive at the meeting, I always feel better there.” When we are at our meetings, Jehovah can use our brothers and sisters to help us.</p>

My comfort and solace came from praying to my loving heavenly Father, Jehovah. Sometimes, I couldn’t find the right words, but he understood me. When I was an emotional wreck, I would pray for peace. I could feel a calm come over my heart and mind and could then go on.” When you pour out your concerns to Jehovah, he is deeply moved by your tears of sorrow, understanding your pain of heart.

I felt useless, sad, and angry.” If you are coping with betrayal or disappointment, take comfort in knowing that Jehovah will never abandon you. The brother said: “I have come to realize that human relationships can fail, but Jehovah is our Rock. No matter what happens, he is always there.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[68]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Hezekiah was comforted by Jehovah’s words. We can similarly find comfort in God’s Word. Jehovah has preserved soothing words that can lift our spirits when we face distressing situations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) When a sister in West Africa was diagnosed with cancer, she often wept. She relates: “One scripture that I particularly find comforting is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:3-23:26:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:3</a>. Even though we seldom have full control over the trials we face, that verse reassures me that Jehovah can give us the kind of inner peace that helps us control how we react to the trials.” Is there a scripture that you have found especially <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>soothing when you are facing situations that seem extremely trying, maybe even hopeless?</p>

<div class="boxContent du-color--gray-900"><p id="p74" data-pid="74">The Bible is rich with soothing expressions that reassure us that Jehovah notices our tears and will help us. Consider a few examples:</p>

But as we noted from the examples of Hannah, David, and King Hezekiah, Jehovah sees the tears we shed and is deeply moved by them. Our tears are truly precious to him. So when we face distressing situations, we certainly want to pour out our heart to Jehovah in prayer. May we never isolate ourselves from our loving brothers and sisters in the congregation. And may we continue to find comfort in the soothing words recorded in the Bible. We can be sure that if we keep enduring faithfully, Jehovah will reward us. That includes the wonderful promise that in time he will wipe out every tear of sorrow, betrayal, and despair from our eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4</a>) Then we will shed only tears of joy.</p>
