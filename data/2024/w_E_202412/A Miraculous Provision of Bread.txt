SONG 97 Life Depends on God’s Word

A Miraculous Provision of Bread


“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all.”​—JOHN 6:35.


FOCUS
Examine the account found in John chapter 6, which relates how Jesus multiplied bread and fish for a large crowd, and draw lessons from it.


 1. What significance does bread have in the Bible?

Your answer


BREAD was a staple for many in Bible times. (Gen. 14:18; Luke 4:4) In fact, it was so important that the Bible sometimes uses “bread” to mean food in general. (Matt. 6:11; Acts 20:7, study note) Bread was also a central feature in two of Jesus’ well-known miracles. (Matt. 16:9, 10) We find one of those accounts in John chapter 6. As we review this account, we will look for lessons that we can apply today.
 2. In what situation did a need for food arise?

Your answer


2 After Jesus’ apostles had finished a preaching tour, Jesus took them along by boat across the Sea of Galilee so that they could rest. (Mark 6:7, 30-32; Luke 9:10) They came to an isolated spot in the area of Bethsaida. Soon, though, thousands of people arrived and crowded around. Jesus did not ignore them. He kindly took time to teach them about the Kingdom and to cure the sick. As it was getting late, the disciples wondered how all those people could get something to eat. Some of them perhaps had limited provisions, but most would need to go into the villages and buy food. (Matt. 14:15; John 6:4, 5) What would Jesus do?
A MIRACLE TO PROVIDE BREAD
 3. How did Jesus respond to the needs of the crowd? (See also picture.)

Your answer


3 Jesus told his apostles: “They do not have to leave; you give them something to eat.” (Matt. 14:16) That was a problem because there were about 5,000 men. And including women and children, there may have been 15,000 people to feed. (Matt. 14:21) Andrew spoke up: “Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many?” (John 6:9) Barley loaves were commonly eaten by the poor and others, and the small fish may have been salted and dried. Still, the amount that the boy had would not be enough to feed so many​—or would it?




Jesus attended to the people’s needs, both spiritual and physical (See paragraph 3)




 4. What can we learn from John 6:11-13? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


4 Wanting to be hospitable to the crowd, Jesus directed the people to recline in groups on the grass. (Mark 6:39, 40; read John 6:11-13.) We read that Jesus gave thanks to his Father for the bread and the fish. It was entirely fitting to thank God, who in reality was the Source of the food. What a good reminder for us to follow Jesus’ example by praying before a meal, whether we are alone or others are around. Jesus then had the food distributed, and the people ate and were satisfied. There were even leftovers, which Jesus did not want to go to waste. So he had the leftovers gathered up, possibly for later use. Jesus set the pattern for us when it comes to using our resources wisely. If you are a parent, why not review this account with your children and discuss what lessons can be learned about prayer, hospitality, and generosity.




Ask yourself, ‘Am I following Jesus’ example of praying before a meal?’ (See paragraph 4)




 5. How did the people react to what Jesus did that day, and how did he respond?

Your answer


5 The people were impressed by Jesus’ way of teaching and by his miracles. Knowing that Moses had promised that God would raise up a special prophet, they may have wondered, ‘Could Jesus be the one?’ (Deut. 18:15-18) If so, it might have seemed that he would be an outstanding ruler, perhaps able to supply bread for the whole nation. Consequently, the crowd was about to “seize [Jesus] to make him king.” (John 6:14, 15) If Jesus allowed that to happen, he would be participating in the politics of the Jews, who were under Roman rule. Did he? No. We read that Jesus decisively ‘withdrew to the mountain.’ So despite pressure from others, he would not get involved in politics. What a lesson for us!
 6. How can we show that we want to follow Jesus’ pattern? (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Obviously, others will not ask us to multiply bread or cure the sick miraculously; nor will they try to make us a king or a national ruler. But they may urge us to get involved in politics by voting for or by voicing support for someone they feel will improve matters. However, Jesus’ example is clear. He refused to get involved with political affairs, even saying later: “My Kingdom is no part of this world.” (John 17:14; 18:36) Christians today do well to mirror Jesus’ thinking and actions. We support, witness about, and pray for that Kingdom. (Matt. 6:10) Let us return to the account about Jesus miraculously providing bread and consider what else we can learn.




Setting a pattern for his followers, Jesus did not get involved in the politics of the Jews or of the Romans (See paragraph 6)




“THE MEANING OF THE LOAVES”
 7. What did Jesus and the apostles do? (John 6:16-20)

Your answer


7 After Jesus fed the crowd, he had his apostles leave the area to return to Capernaum by boat and he withdrew to the mountain, thus avoiding the crowd’s effort to make him king. (Read John 6:16-20.) While the apostles were sailing, a storm arose, bringing violent wind and waves. Then Jesus came to them, walking on the water. And he invited the apostle Peter to walk on the water too. (Matt. 14:22-31) Once Jesus was in the boat, the wind abated. The disciples were moved to say: “You really are God’s Son.”a (Matt. 14:33) Still, they did not see the connection between this miracle and what happened earlier with the crowd. Mark adds this detail: “[The apostles] were utterly amazed, for they had not grasped the meaning of the loaves, but their hearts continued dull in understanding.” (Mark 6:50-52) Yes, they failed to grasp the extent of the power that Jehovah had given Jesus to perform miracles. Soon, though, Jesus himself brought up the miracle of the bread, and he provided a lesson for us.
8-9. Why did the crowd pursue Jesus? (John 6:26, 27)

Your answer


8 The crowd that Jesus had fed were focused on satisfying their physical needs and desires. How so? The following day, they saw that Jesus and his apostles had left. So the crowd boarded some boats that had arrived from Tiberias and headed toward Capernaum to find Jesus. (John 6:22-24) Did they do that mainly to hear more about the Kingdom? No. They were primarily thinking about their physical need for bread. How do we know?
9 Note what happened when the crowd caught up with Jesus near Capernaum. Jesus openly said that their priority was satisfying their temporary physical needs. He acknowledged that they “ate from the loaves and were satisfied” with “food that perishes.” He urged them to work instead for “food that remains for everlasting life.” (Read John 6:26, 27.) Jesus said that his Father would provide such food. The idea that food could lead to everlasting life must have been startling! What food could possibly do that, and how could Jesus’ listeners receive it?
10. What “work of God” did the people need to learn about?

Your answer


10 Apparently, those Jews felt that they would have to perform some acts or works to qualify to receive such food. They may have been thinking of the “works” of the Mosaic Law. However, Jesus told them: “This is the work of God, that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent.” (John 6:28, 29) Exercising faith in God’s representative is needed in order to “have everlasting life.” In fact, Jesus had previously spoken about this. (John 3:16-18, 36) And he would later have more to say about how we can gain everlasting life.​—John 17:3.
11. How did the Jews indicate that they were still concerned about being satisfied with bread? (Psalm 78:24, 25)

Your answer


11 Those Jews did not accept Jesus’ teaching about a new “work of God.” They asked him: “What are you performing as a sign, so that we may see it and believe you?” (John 6:30) They mentioned that their ancestors in Moses’ day had received manna, which could be likened to bread. (Neh. 9:15; read Psalm 78:24, 25.) Clearly, their minds were still centered on being satisfied with literal bread. They even failed to press Jesus for clarification when he next spoke of “the true bread from heaven,” which was like life-giving manna from heaven. (John 6:32) They were so focused on their physical needs that they ignored the spiritual truths that Jesus was trying to share with them. What can we learn from this account?
OUR PRIMARY FOCUS
12. How did Jesus indicate what is most important?

Your answer


12 Here is a key lesson for us found in John chapter 6. Our primary focus should be our spiritual needs. Recall that Jesus had made that point when rebuffing Satan’s temptation. (Matt. 4:3, 4) And in the Sermon on the Mount, he emphasized being conscious of one’s spiritual need. (Matt. 5:3) Accordingly, we can ask ourselves, ‘Does my way of life show that I put greater emphasis on filling my spiritual need than on satisfying my physical desires?’
13. (a) Why can we rightly enjoy food? (b) What warning merits our attention? (1 Corinthians 10:6, 7, 11)

Your answers


13 It is appropriate for us to pray for our physical needs and to enjoy satisfying these. (Luke 11:3) Hard work that enables us “to eat and drink” brings joy and is “from the hand of the true God.” (Eccl. 2:24; 8:15; Jas. 1:17) Still, we need to keep material things in their proper place. The apostle Paul highlighted this when writing to Christians living near the end of the Jewish systems of things. He brought up events from Israel’s past, including what happened near Mount Sinai. He warned Christians “not to desire injurious things, as [the Israelites] desired them.” (Read 1 Corinthians 10:6, 7, 11.) The Israelites let their longing for food turn even Jehovah’s miraculous provisions into “injurious things.” (Num. 11:4-6, 31-34) And in conjunction with a golden calf, they ate, drank, and had a good time. (Ex. 32:4-6) Paul cited their experience as a warning for Christians living before the end of the Jewish systems of things in 70 C.E. We now live near the end of a system of things, so we do well to take Paul’s counsel seriously.
14. Regarding food, what can we expect in the new world?

Your answer


14 When speaking of “our bread for this day,” Jesus pointed to the time when God’s will would be done “as in heaven, also on earth.” (Matt. 6:9-11) What picture does that bring to your mind? The Bible indicates that God’s will on earth includes good food. In line with Isaiah 25:6-8, there will be plenty of fine physical food to enjoy under Jehovah’s Kingdom. Psalm 72:16 foretells: “There will be an abundance of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains it will overflow.” Do you look forward to using some of that grain to prepare your favorite type of bread or to try out new recipes? Along with that, you may enjoy the fruitage of vineyards that you planted. (Isa. 65:21, 22) And you will not be alone.
15. What education will be featured in the coming resurrection? (John 6:35)

Your answer


15 Read John 6:35. What is ahead for those who ate of the bread and the fish that Jesus provided? In the coming resurrection, you may meet some of them. Even if in the past they did not exercise faith, they may be resurrected. (John 5:28, 29) Such ones will have to learn the meaning of Jesus’ words: “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all.” They will need to develop faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, faith that he gave his life for them. At that time, there will be a program of spiritual education for resurrected ones and any children born then. What a joy it will be to have a share in that teaching program! Your doing so will be more delightful than eating literal bread. Yes, spiritual matters will be the highlight.
16. What will we examine next?

Your answer


16 We have considered part of the account in John chapter 6, but Jesus had much more to teach about “everlasting life.” That merited the attention of those Jews and it now merits ours. We will continue to consider John chapter 6 in the next article.
