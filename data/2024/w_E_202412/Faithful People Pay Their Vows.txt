Faithful People Pay Their Vows




Read Judges 11:30-40 to learn from the account of Jephthah and his daughter about paying vows.
Analyze the context. How did faithful Israelites view vows made to Jehovah? (Num. 30:2) How did Jephthah and his daughter show that they had faith in Jehovah?​—Judg. 11:9-11, 19-24, 36.
Dig deeper. What did Jephthah evidently have in mind when he made his vow? (w16.04 7 ¶12) What sacrifices did Jephthah and his daughter make to fulfill his vow? (w16.04 7-8 ¶14-16) What sort of vows might Christians make today?​—w17.04 5-8 ¶10-19.
Identify the lessons. Ask yourself:
  ‘What can help me to keep my vow of dedication?’ (w20.03 13 ¶20)

  ‘What sacrifices can I make to serve Jehovah more fully?’

  ‘How can I strengthen my commitment to fulfill my marriage vow?’ (Matt. 19:5, 6; Eph. 5:28-33)
