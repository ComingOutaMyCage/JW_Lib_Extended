Soon, though, thousands of people arrived and crowded around. Jesus did not ignore them. He kindly took time to teach them about the Kingdom and to cure the sick. As it was getting late, the disciples wondered how all those people could get something to eat. Some of them perhaps had limited provisions, but most would need to go into the villages and buy food.

What a good reminder for us to follow Jesus’ example by praying before a meal, whether we are alone or others are around. Jesus then had the food distributed, and the people ate and were satisfied. There were even leftovers, which Jesus did not want to go to waste. So he had the leftovers gathered up, possibly for later use.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:3-42:11:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Luke 11:3</a>) Hard work that enables us “to eat and drink” brings joy and is “from the hand of the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Eccl. 2:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:15-21:8:15" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 8:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> Jas. 1:17</a>) Still, we need to keep material things in their proper place. The apostle Paul highlighted this when writing to Christians living near the end of the Jewish systems of things. He brought up events from Israel’s past, including what happened near Mount Sinai. He warned Christians “not to desire injurious things, as [the Israelites] desired them.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:6-46:10:7" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:6, 7,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:11-46:10:11" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> <strong>11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The Israelites let their longing for food turn even Jehovah’s miraculous provisions into “injurious things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:4-4:11:6" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Num. 11:4-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:31-4:11:34" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 31-34</a>) And in conjunction with a golden calf, they ate, drank, and had a good time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:4-2:32:6" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ex. 32:4-6</a>) Paul cited their experience as a warning for Christians living before the end of the Jewish systems of things in 70 C.E. We now live near the end of a system of things, so we do well to take Paul’s counsel seriously.</p>

The Bible indicates that God’s will on earth includes good food. In line with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:8" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>, there will be plenty of fine physical food to enjoy under Jehovah’s Kingdom. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a> foretells: “There will be an abundance of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains it will overflow.” Do you look forward to using some of that grain to prepare your favorite type of bread or to try out new recipes? Along with that, you may enjoy the fruitage of vineyards that you planted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:22" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Isa. 65:21, 22</a>) And you will not be alone.</p>

In the coming resurrection, you may meet some of them. Even if in the past they did not exercise faith, they may be resurrected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) Such ones will have to learn the meaning of Jesus’ words: “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all.” They will need to develop faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, faith that he gave his life for them. At that time, there will be a program of spiritual education for resurrected ones and any children born then. What a joy it will be to have a share in that teaching program! Your doing so will be more delightful than eating literal bread. Yes, spiritual matters will be the highlight.</p>
