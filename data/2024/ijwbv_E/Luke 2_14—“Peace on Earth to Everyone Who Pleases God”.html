<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>These words of praise, proclaimed by angels at the time of Jesus’ birth, indicate that those who put faith in Jesus can enjoy God’s approval and experience peace.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Glory in the heights above to God.”</strong> By means of this expression, the angels emphasize that God is worthy of receiving all glory. The expression also draws attention to the fact that Jesus’ birth and earthly ministry would greatly contribute to Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God’s glory. For example, Jesus always gave credit to God for what he taught, such as when he said: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him who sent me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 7:16-18</a>) When Jesus performed miracles, onlookers often “began to glorify God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:18-42:5:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 5:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:24-42:5:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 24-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:19-43:5:19" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 5:19</a>) Even Jesus’ death contributed to God’s glory. It opened the way for God to accomplish his grand purpose of filling the earth with righteous and peace-loving humans.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“On earth peace.”</strong> This peace involves much more than just the absence of war. It includes the peace, or inner calm, that is only possible when a person has Jehovah’s approval. Thanks to Jesus, humans can achieve this peaceful relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) And as King of God’s Kingdom, Jesus will bring complete and lasting peace to the whole earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 1:32, 33</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>“Men of goodwill.”</strong> This expression refers to people who have God’s goodwill, or favor, because of their genuine faith in him and the one whom he sent, Jesus. It does not refer to an expression of God’s goodwill toward all humans regardless of their attitudes and actions, nor does it refer to the goodwill that humans may show. Some Bible translations, such as the <em>King James Version,</em> render this expression “good will towards men.” However, older more reliable Greek manuscripts support the rendering of the <em>New World Translation</em> and many other modern translations in conveying the idea of peace among people <em>whom God approves.</em>—See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502300139/12">Luke 2:14 From Additional Translations</a>.”</p>

Soon after his birth, an angel appeared to shepherds who were “living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:4-42:2:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 2:4-8</a>) The angel announced “good news of a great joy,” telling the shepherds: “Today there was born to you in David’s city a savior, who is Christ the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:9-42:2:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 2:9-11</a>) The shepherds were told where they could find the newborn, and then they witnessed a multitude of spirit creatures praising God. Upon reaching Bethlehem, the shepherds found Mary and Joseph along with the baby Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:12-42:2:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 2:12-16</a>) After relating their amazing experience, the shepherds returned to their flocks, “glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:17-42:2:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 2:17-20</a>.</p>
