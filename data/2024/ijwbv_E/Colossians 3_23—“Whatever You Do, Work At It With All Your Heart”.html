<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>A Christian should strive to be a hard worker because his attitude toward work is linked to his worship of Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Whatever you are doing.”</strong> Those who want to worship Jehovah try to follow what the Bible says in <em>all</em> that they do. They strive to be industrious, honest, and trustworthy in their daily activities at home, at work, and at school.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:13-20:11:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Romans 12:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Hebrews 13:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“Work at it with all your heart.”</strong> The expression “with all your heart” is translated from a Greek expression that “describes a person’s commitment in acting or fulfilling God’s will with his entire <em>vital energy.”</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Thus, such a worker uses all his physical and mental abilities to do his best when caring for a task. Other Bible translations render the expression “wholeheartedly” (<em>New Catholic Bible</em>) or “heartily” (<em>King James Version</em>).—See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502300136/14">Colossians 3:23 From Additional Translations</a>.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>“For Jehovah, and not for men.”</strong> No matter what work they are doing, Christians take it seriously because they recognize that their relationship with Jehovah God is involved. They are primarily interested in pleasing him, not an employer or another human. A Christian’s excellent work ethic and positive attitude reflect well not only on him but also on the God he worships. In this way, a Christian does what he can “so that the name of God . . . may never be spoken of injuriously.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:1-54:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:22</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The Bible book of Colossians was written by the apostle Paul to Christians in the ancient city of Colossae.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> He apparently wrote it toward the end of his first imprisonment in Rome, about 60-61 C.E.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Colossians contains counsel to help Christians of all backgrounds and circumstances to worship God in unity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:11</a>) It encourages them to reflect God’s qualities, such as love, kindness, and mercy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12-14</a>) It also explains how worship of God should affect every aspect of a person’s life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:18-51:4:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Colossians 3:18–4:1</a>.</p>
