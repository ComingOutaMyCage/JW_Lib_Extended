Meaning of John 14:6

A person who wants to worship the Father, Jehovaha God, must recognize Jesus’ vital role.
“I am the way.” Jesus provides “the way” to approach God acceptably. For example, those who pray to God must do so in Jesus’ name. (John 16:23, 24) Jesus’ death makes it possible for humans to be reconciled to God, or restored to his favor. (Romans 5:8-11) Jesus also set a pattern of conduct that those who want to please God must follow.—John 13:15.
“I am . . . the truth.” Jesus always spoke and lived the truth. (1 Peter 2:22) By listening to him, a person could learn the truth about God. (John 8:31, 32) Jesus was also “the truth” because he fulfilled Bible prophecy. He thus made God’s promises a reality.—John 1:17; 2 Corinthians 1:19, 20; Colossians 2:16, 17.
“I am . . . the life.” Jesus gave his life so that those who exercise faith in him might have everlasting life. (John 3:16, 36) He is also “the life” for those who have died, because he will resurrect them from the dead.—John 5:28, 29; 11:25.
“No one comes to the Father except through me.” Those who want an approved relationship with God must accept Jesus’ unique role. They do so by praying to God in Jesus’ name, thus showing that they recognize Jesus Christ’s authority. (John 15:16) They also acknowledge that salvation is possible only because of Jesus.—Acts 4:12; Philippians 2:8-11.



Context of John 14:6

John chapters 13 to 17 contain Jesus’ parting counsel to his 11 faithful apostles on the night before his death. In chapter 14, Jesus encouraged his disciples to show faith in him and in his Father and to love and obey them. (John 14:1, 12, 15-17, 21, 23, 24) He revealed the close relationship he had and still has with his Father. (John 14:10, 20, 28, 31) Although he would shortly be returning to heaven, Jesus assured his disciples that he would not abandon them. (John 14:18) He also promised them “the helper” and described it as “the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name.” (John 14:25-27) In these and other ways, Jesus prepared his followers for the challenges that lay ahead.



a Jehovah is God’s personal name.—Psalm 83:18.
