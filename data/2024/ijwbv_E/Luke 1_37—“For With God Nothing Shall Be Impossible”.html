<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of Luke 1:37</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Almighty God can do things that are impossible from a human perspective. Nothing can prevent him from fulfilling what he declares or promises.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The original-language word for “declaration” can refer to a “word” or a “saying”—in this case, of God. It can also refer to the result of what Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God has declared. Because God’s word always comes true, Luke 1:37 can also be rendered: “For God’s promises can never fail” or “For with God, nothing is impossible.” These renderings of the original Greek text convey the same basic truth: No declaration or promise of God will go unfulfilled, because nothing is impossible for him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Similar expressions about God’s promises appear throughout the Bible. For example, Jehovah, by means of his angel, foretold that Abraham’s childless wife, Sarah, would become pregnant in her old age. God added: “Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:13-1:18:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 18:13, 14</a>) After contemplating God’s creations, the patriarch Job acknowledged: “Nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:2-18:42:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 42:2</a>) And when Jesus’ followers expressed concerns about their ability to meet God’s standards for salvation, Jesus reminded them that “with God all things are possible.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:25-40:19:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 19:25, 26</a>.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Context of Luke 1:37</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>An angel named Gabriel spoke the words of Luke 1:37 to a young Jewish virgin named Mary. Gabriel had just told her that she would give birth to the “Son of the Most High” and should “name him Jesus.” He would become the King of <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502017850&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502017850&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">God’s Kingdom</a>, which will rule forever.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:33" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 1:26-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Mary asked how such a thing could be possible because she was unmarried and “not having sexual relations with a man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:34-42:1:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 1:34, 35</a>) Gabriel replied that God would use His holy spirit, or active force. At the time, Jesus was a spirit son of God in heaven. So Jehovah used his holy spirit to transfer his Son’s life from heaven to Mary’s womb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:7" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Philippians 2:5-7</a>) She thus became pregnant miraculously. To strengthen her faith in God’s power, the angel told her that her relative Elizabeth had recently conceived a son “in her old age.” Elizabeth and her husband, Zechariah, had been childless because Elizabeth was barren. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:36-42:1:36" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 1:36</a>) Their son became John the Baptist, whose ministry Jehovah also declared in advance.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:10-42:1:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 1:10-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:1-42:3:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 3:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The angel Gabriel then spoke the words at Luke 1:37, perhaps with both Mary and Elizabeth in mind. Those same words assure Jehovah’s worshippers today that he will continue to keep his promises. That includes his promise to replace human governments with the righteous rule of his Son, Jesus Christ, the King of God’s heavenly Kingdom.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 7:13, 14</a>.</p>
