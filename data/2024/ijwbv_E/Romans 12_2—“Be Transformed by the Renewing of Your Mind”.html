<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Those who want to please God must not only reject negative influences but also change their personality. God does not force them to change; they do so because they love him and realize that his requirements are kind and reasonable and bring benefits.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Stop being molded by this system of things.”</strong> The “system of things,” that is, the world of human society with its standards, practices, and manners, does not reflect God’s values or thinking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) It exerts constant pressure on people, which can mold, or shape, their behavior and personality. To worship God acceptably, a person must resist the world’s influence, otherwise he will develop traits that are harmful to himself and that are displeasing to God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4:17-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“Be transformed by making your mind over.”</strong> A person must also work on changing his innermost attitudes and feelings. The extent to which this must be done is indicated by the Greek word translated “be transformed,” which describes a change similar to that of a caterpillar into a butterfly. Those who worship God must put on a “new personality.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:9-51:3:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>“Prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</strong> God wants those who worship him to be fully convinced of what they believe. Such ones do this by studying God’s Word, applying what it says, and experiencing the benefits of living by God’s standards. Thus, they prove for themselves that God’s ways are best.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8</a>.</p>

Such worship touches every aspect of life and requires that a person use his “power of reason” instead of acting on blind faith or misguided emotion.
