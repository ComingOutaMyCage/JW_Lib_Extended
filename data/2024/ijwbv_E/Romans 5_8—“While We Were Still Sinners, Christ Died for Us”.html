(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) As sinners, humans tend to think and act in ways that go against God’s righteous standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:21-51:1:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 1:21, 22</a>) However, God made it possible for us to become reconciled to him “through the death of his Son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:10-45:5:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 5:10</a>) As a result, we can have the opportunity to enjoy a good relationship with God now and the prospect of eternal life in the future.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:11-45:5:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 5:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:9, 10</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The apostle Paul wrote these words to Christians living in Rome. In what is now chapter 5 of his letter to the Romans, Paul explained why Christians could rejoice and be confident of their hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 5:1, 2</a>) That hope “does not lead to disappointment,” because it is based on God’s great love expressed through Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:5-45:5:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 5:5, 6</a>) Jesus maintained perfect obedience to God, something that the first man, Adam, failed to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:19-45:5:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 5:19</a>) Adam’s disobedience resulted in sin and death for his descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) In contrast, Jesus’ perfect obedience and sacrificial death make it possible for obedient humans to have the hope of everlasting life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:21-45:5:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:21</a>.</p>
