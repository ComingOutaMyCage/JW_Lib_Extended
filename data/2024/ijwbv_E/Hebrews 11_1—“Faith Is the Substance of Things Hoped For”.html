<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of Hebrews 11:1</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>This verse provides the most concise Scriptural definition of faith and shows that faith involves more than mere belief.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.”</strong> In the original-language text of Hebrews 11:1, the Greek word translated “faith” conveys the thought of confidence, trust, or firm persuasion. Such faith is not based on wishful thinking; it is an “assured expectation.” The Greek term rendered “assured expectation”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> could also be translated “title deed,” referring to a guarantee that gives assurance, or confidence, to the one possessing it.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“Faith is . . . the evident demonstration [or, “convincing evidence,” footnote] of realities that are not seen.”</strong> Faith exists as a result of compelling proof. Such proof is so strong that it convinces a person that even though he cannot see a thing, it is real.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Context of Hebrews 11:1</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The Bible book of Hebrews is a letter written by the apostle Paul to first-century Christians living in and around Jerusalem. In this part of the letter, Paul discusses the importance of faith. For example, he writes: “Without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) After defining faith in Hebrews 11:1, Paul provides examples of men and women in the Bible record who displayed this quality. He recounts how they demonstrated their faith by acting in harmony with God’s will.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:4-58:11:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:4-38</a>.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div id="footnote1" data-fnid="1" class="fn-ref"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> The Greek word here translated “assured expectation” is <em>hy·poʹsta·sis,</em> which could literally be rendered “that which stands under, a foundation.” In Latin, this word is translated <em>sub·stanʹti·a,</em> from which the English word “substance,” used in the <em>King James Version,</em> is derived.</p></div>
