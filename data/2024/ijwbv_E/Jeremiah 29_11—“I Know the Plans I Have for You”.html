<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Jehovah God promised his worshippers that he had a peaceful future in mind for them. Although written to people in the past, these words still describe God’s thoughts. He is “the God who gives hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:13</a>) In fact, he recorded such promises in the Bible so that “we might have hope” for a better future.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Context of Jeremiah 29:11</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>These words were part of a letter sent to the Israelites in Babylon, who had been taken captive from Jerusalem.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:1-24:29:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:1</a>) God told the exiles that they would remain in captivity for a long time and that they should build homes, plant gardens, and raise families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:4-24:29:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:4-9</a>) However, God added: “When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you, and I will make good my promise by bringing you back to [Jerusalem].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:10-24:29:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) God thus guaranteed that he would not forget them and that their hope of returning home would come true.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:16-24:31:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>God kept his promise to the Israelites. As he had foretold, Babylon was conquered by Persian King Cyrus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:1-23:45:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:30-24:51:32" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 51:30-32</a>) Thereafter, Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to their homeland. After 70 years of captivity, they were back in Jerusalem.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:20-14:36:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:20-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:1-15:3:1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ezra 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The fulfilled promise of Jeremiah 29:11 assures those who hope in God’s promises today. These promises include earth-wide peace by means of the Kingdom of God under Christ Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Isaiah 55:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> God has a specific “plan” for each individual.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God lets people choose for themselves the course they will follow. His words at Jeremiah 29:11 were addressed to the Israelites in Babylon as a group, and he had a thought in mind for that group—a future of peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:4-24:29:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:4</a>) However, God allowed each person to choose whether to benefit from His promise or not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:32-24:29:32" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 29:32</a>) Those who chose to seek God did so by praying to him with a sincere heart.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:12-24:29:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:12, 13</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> God will prosper his worshippers with material riches.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The word “prosper” found in some Bibles at Jeremiah 29:11 is translated from a Hebrew word that means “peace, health, and well-being.” According to the context, God promised to give the exiled Israelites not wealth but peace and welfare. They would continue to exist as a people and would one day return to Jerusalem.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:4-24:29:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:4-10</a>.</p>
