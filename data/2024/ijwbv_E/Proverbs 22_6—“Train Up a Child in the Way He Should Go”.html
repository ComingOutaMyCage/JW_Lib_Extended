<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Parents who teach their children to love God and respect his laws can expect such training to have a positive and lasting influence.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Train a boy in the way he should go.”</strong> These words can also be rendered “start a child on the right road.” Time and again, the book of Proverbs urges parents to teach their children about right and wrong early in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:18-20:19:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:15-20:22:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:15-20:29:15" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 29:15</a>) Yet, loving parents recognize that their children, like adults, have free will. So rather than merely tell their children what to do, they reason with them and help them to grow into mature and responsible adults who are able to make good decisions on their own.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Some Bible scholars suggest that this expression means “train a child in accordance with his nature,” or according to his natural tendencies. Such an interpretation might sound practical, but the Hebrew expression rendered “in the way he should go” likely refers to a life course that is good and righteous. The book of Proverbs highlights two ways that a person can go. One is called “the way of good people,” “the way of wisdom,” and “the right way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:20-20:2:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:11-20:4:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:19-20:23:19" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 23:19</a>) The other is called “the way of evil men,” “the way of the fool,” and “the wrong way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:14-20:4:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:15-20:12:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:29-20:16:29" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 16:29</a>) The way that a child “should go” thus refers to “the right way”—the way of life taught in God’s Word, the Bible.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119:105</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>“Even when he grows old he will not depart from it.”</strong> When parents teach their child God’s moral standards, he is more likely to stay on the right path throughout his life. This does not mean, however, that a child who receives proper training will never “depart” from the right way or stray from God’s laws. For example, if a person spends time with people who promote what is bad, he may leave “the upright paths” and do what is wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:12-20:2:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:12-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) Even so, when parents train their children to follow God’s standards, they are giving them the best opportunity to be successful in life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:11-20:2:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>

These sayings emphasize the value of having a good reputation with Jehovah,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> something that a person can acquire by showing humility, generosity, and industriousness.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:17-20:22:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:17-19</a>) By training their children in harmony with that way of life, parents show that they want what is best for their children.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>.</p>
