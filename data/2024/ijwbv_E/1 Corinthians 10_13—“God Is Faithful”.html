<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of 1 Corinthians 10:13</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>This verse points to an endearing quality of God, namely, his faithfulness. God’s loyal worshippers can rely on his help, especially when they face trials or temptations.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.”</strong> God’s worshippers may be tempted to do something that displeases him. Such tests, although difficult, are not unusual or uncommon in that many people have experienced them.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Thus, God’s worshippers can be sure that they too are able to bear such things.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“God is faithful.”</strong> Jehovah<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> God is trustworthy and dependable. He has always kept his promise that he will not abandon those who love him and remain loyal and obedient to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:9-5:7:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:10-19:9:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Psalm 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 37:28</a>) Therefore, those who worship him can trust that he will also keep the two encouraging promises that follow in the verse.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>“He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.”</strong> God shows his faithfulness by not allowing trials to become so severe that it would be impossible for someone to endure them. He knows the limitations of all his worshippers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:14-19:94:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 94:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>“Along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.”</strong> God can either remove a trial or provide what his worshippers need to endure it. For example, he can provide guidance by means of <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:502014219/">holy spirit</a>, <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:500100121/">comfort from the Bible</a>, or practical assistance through fellow believers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:11-51:4:11" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Colossians 4:11</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Context of 1 Corinthians 10:13</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>This verse appears in a letter that the apostle Paul wrote to the Christian congregation in Corinth. In this part of his letter, Paul used the history of ancient Israel as a warning example for the Corinthians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:11-46:10:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>) Paul lists a number of tests and temptations that the Israelites faced, including idolatry and sexual immorality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:6-46:10:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:6-10</a>) Some of them gave in to these temptations. Based on their example, Paul reminds Christians that they should not be overconfident, thinking that they would never give in to temptation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:12-46:10:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>) However, he goes on to reassure them with the words of 1 Corinthians 10:13. God’s loyal worshippers are able to overcome any trial.</p>
