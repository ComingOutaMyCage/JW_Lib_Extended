Meaning of Romans 5:8

Jehovaha God showed great love when he allowed his Son, Jesus Christ, to die in behalf of sinful humans. (John 3:16) As sinners, humans tend to think and act in ways that go against God’s righteous standards. (Colossians 1:21, 22) However, God made it possible for us to become reconciled to him “through the death of his Son.” (Romans 5:10) As a result, we can have the opportunity to enjoy a good relationship with God now and the prospect of eternal life in the future.—Romans 5:11; 1 John 4:9, 10.



Context of Romans 5:8

The apostle Paul wrote these words to Christians living in Rome. In what is now chapter 5 of his letter to the Romans, Paul explained why Christians could rejoice and be confident of their hope. (Romans 5:1, 2) That hope “does not lead to disappointment,” because it is based on God’s great love expressed through Jesus. (Romans 5:5, 6) Jesus maintained perfect obedience to God, something that the first man, Adam, failed to do. (Romans 5:19) Adam’s disobedience resulted in sin and death for his descendants. (Romans 5:12) In contrast, Jesus’ perfect obedience and sacrificial death make it possible for obedient humans to have the hope of everlasting life.—Romans 5:21.



a Jehovah is the personal name of God as revealed in the Bible.—Psalm 83:18.
