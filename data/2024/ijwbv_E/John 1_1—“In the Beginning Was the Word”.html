<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of John 1:1</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>This scripture reveals details about Jesus Christ’s life before he came to earth as a human. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:14-17</a>) In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">verse 14</a>, “the Word” (or “the Logos,” Greek, <em>ho loʹgos</em>) is used as a title. The title “the Word” apparently describes Jesus’ role in communicating God’s commands and instructions to others. Jesus continued to make known God’s word during his ministry on earth and after he returned to heaven.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 7:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 1:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>“The beginning” refers to the time when God began his creative work and produced the Word. Thereafter, the Word was used by God in the creation of all other things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:2-43:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:2, 3</a>) The Bible states that Jesus is “the firstborn of all creation” and that “by means of him all other things were created.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The phrase “the Word was a god” describes the divine or godlike nature that Jesus possessed before he came to earth. He can be described in this way because of his role as God’s Spokesman and his unique position as the firstborn Son of God through whom God created all other things.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Context of John 1:1</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The Bible book of John is an account of Jesus’ earthly life and ministry. The opening verses of the first chapter reveal Jesus’ prehuman existence, his unique relationship with God, and his central role in God’s dealings with humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 1:1-18</a>) Those details help us to understand what Jesus said and did during his ministry on earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:38-43:6:38" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:49-43:12:50" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 12:49, 50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 14:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:5-43:17:5" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 17:5</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Misconceptions About John 1:1</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> The last phrase in John 1:1 should be translated “the Word was God.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> While many Bible translators render the verse this way, others see the need to render it differently. In the original-language text, the two occurrences of “God” (Greek, <em>the·osʹ</em>) at John 1:1 are grammatically different. In the first occurrence, the word “God” is preceded by the Greek definite article, while the article does not appear before the second occurrence. Many scholars note that the absence of the definite article before the second <em>the·osʹ</em> is significant. For example, <em>The Translator’s New Testament</em> says regarding this absence of the article: “In effect it gives an adjectival quality to the second use of <em>Theos</em> (God) so that the phrase means ‘The Word was <em>divine.’”</em><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Other scholars<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> and Bible translations point to this same distinction.—See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502300113/21">John 1:1 From Additional Translations</a>.”</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> The verse teaches that the Word is the same as Almighty God.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The statement “the Word was with God” indicates that two separate persons are discussed in the verse. It is not possible for the Word to be “with God” and at the same time be God Almighty. The context also confirms that the Word is not Almighty God. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 1:18</a> states that “no man has seen God at any time.” However, people did see the Word, Jesus, for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 1:14</a> states that “the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory.”</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> The Word has always existed.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The “beginning” referred to in this verse cannot mean “the beginning” of God, because God had no beginning. Jehovah<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> God is “from everlasting to everlasting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:1-19:90:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 90:1, 2</a>) However, the Word, Jesus Christ, did have a beginning. He is “the beginning of the creation by God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 3:14</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> To call the Word “a god” teaches polytheism, the worship of many gods.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The Greek word for “God” or “god” (<em>the·osʹ</em>) often corresponds to the Hebrew words <em>ʼel</em> and <em>ʼelo·himʹ,</em> used in what is commonly called the Old Testament. These Hebrew words are thought to convey the basic meaning “Mighty One; Strong One” and are used with reference to the almighty God, other gods, and even humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:6-19:82:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 82:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:34-43:10:34" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> John 10:34</a>) The Word is the one through whom God created all other things, so he certainly could be described as a mighty one. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 1:3</a>) Describing the Word as “a god” is in line with the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which foretold that God’s chosen one, the Messiah or Christ, would be called “Mighty God” (Hebrew, <em>ʼEl Gib·bohrʹ</em>), but not “God Almighty” (<em>ʼEl Shad·daiʹ,</em> as in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:11-1:35:11" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 35:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:3-2:6:3" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Exodus 6:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:10:5-26:10:5" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Ezekiel 10:5</a>).</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>The Bible does not teach polytheism. Jesus Christ said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 4:10</a>) The Bible states: “For even though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords,’ there is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and we through him.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:5, 6</a>.</p>
