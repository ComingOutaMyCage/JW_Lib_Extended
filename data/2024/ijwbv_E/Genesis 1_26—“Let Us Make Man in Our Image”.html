<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of Genesis 1:26</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Humans were created in God’s image, with the ability to cultivate and manifest qualities that God possesses, such as love, empathy, and justice. That explains why humans can actually imitate God’s personality.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“God said: ‘Let us make man in our image.’”</strong> Before Jehovah God<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> made anyone or anything else, he created a powerful spirit being who later became known as Jesus. By means of Jesus, “all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 1:16</a>) Jesus reflects Jehovah’s personality—“he is the image of the invisible God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>) Fittingly, then, God could say to Jesus: “Let <strong>us</strong> make man in <strong>our</strong> image.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“Let them have in subjection . . . the domestic animals and all the earth.”</strong> Animals were not created in God’s image. They were not designed to display distinctive human characteristics such as love or to possess a conscience. Still, God cares about the welfare of his animal creatures. That is why he declared that humans were to have the animals “in subjection,” a declaration that can also be rendered “rule over” (<em>New International Version</em>) or “take charge of” (<em>Common English Bible</em>). Jehovah was thus entrusting humans with the responsibility to care for the animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:6-19:8:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 8:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:10-20:12:10" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Proverbs 12:10</a>) Jehovah expects mankind to be good stewards of the earth and all living things on it.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The opening two chapters of Genesis give an overview of the creation of the universe, our planet, and life on earth. Everything Jehovah created is masterful, but humans are his most remarkable earthly creation. When God finished his creative works, he “saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Misconceptions about Genesis 1:26</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> Only men—not women—have the capacity to imitate or reflect God’s qualities.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> The word “man” that appears in many English Bible translations could cause a reader to think that only males are being referred to. However, in this context, the original Hebrew word refers to all humans, both male and female. Both men and women can reflect God’s qualities. They both have equal opportunity to gain his favor and the gift of everlasting life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
</div><div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> God has physical features similar to ours.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> “God is a Spirit”—that is, he exists outside the physical realm. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) Although the Bible sometimes refers to his face, hands, heart, and so forth, these are word pictures that teach us about God in terms humans can understand.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:6-2:15:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 15:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:12</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> Genesis 1:26 proves that Jesus is God.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> God and Jesus have a close father-and-son relationship, but they are not the same person. Jesus taught that God is superior to him.
