<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of Jeremiah 11:11</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>God was addressing the Jews who lived in the time of the prophet Jeremiah. Because the people disregarded Jehovah’s<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> righteous laws and the loving correction given by his prophets, he would not protect them from the tragic consequences of their bad ways.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:24-20:1:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:24-32</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>“Therefore this is what Jehovah says.”</strong> The word “therefore” links the preceding verses with what follows. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:1-24:11:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 11:1-10</a>, Jehovah told his people that they had broken the covenant, or binding agreement, that their forefathers had made with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:7-2:24:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 24:7</a>) Instead of worshipping their Creator, the Jews turned to idols. This apostasy fostered all kinds of wickedness—even child sacrifice!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:31-24:7:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 7:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>“Here I am bringing on them a calamity.”</strong> The Bible often speaks of God as doing something that he merely allows. How was that true in this case? By turning to false gods and ignoring Jehovah’s wholesome standards, his people brought untold suffering upon themselves. They also lost God’s protection. As a result, a powerful enemy—the king of Babylon—was able to conquer Jerusalem and take its inhabitants into exile. The false gods in whom the people had trusted could not save them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:12-24:11:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 11:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:8-24:25:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 25:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>By allowing those tragedies to befall his people, God was not being unjust or evil. “With evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone,” states <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>. Granted, the <em>King James Version</em> says that God “will bring evil upon [the Jews].” However, the original-language word<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> translated “evil” at Jeremiah 11:11 can also be rendered “calamity” or “disaster”—terms that accurately describe the sufferings that overtook the Jews.</p>

</div>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“When they call to me for help, I will not listen to them.”</strong> Jehovah does not listen to the prayers of those whose “hands are filled with blood” or of those who look to false gods for deliverance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:15-23:1:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:17-23:42:17" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 42:17</a>) However, he does listen to those who sincerely repent of their bad ways and humbly return to him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:16-23:1:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:16-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:6-23:55:7" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 55:6, 7</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Context of Jeremiah 11:11</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>In the year 647 B.C.E., Jehovah commissioned Jeremiah to be his prophet. For 40 years, Jeremiah warned the people of Judah about God’s coming judgment. But they refused to listen. During that time, the prophet penned the words found at Jeremiah 11:11. Finally, in 607 B.C.E., the prophetic warnings were fulfilled when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:6-24:6:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jeremiah 6:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:39:1-24:39:2" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 39:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:39:8-24:39:9" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The book of Jeremiah also contains a message of hope. Jehovah said: “When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, . . . I will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place [the Jewish homeland].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:10-24:29:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) Jehovah ‘made good’ on that promise in 537 B.C.E., following the conquest of Babylon by the Medes and Persians. Jehovah allowed his people, who were scattered throughout the empire, to return to their homeland and restore true worship.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:22-14:36:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:14-24:29:14" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 29:14</a>.</p>
