<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>God tells us his personal name and adds that he does not share his praise or honor with idols.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span> God gave himself this personal name, which is commonly translated “Jehovah” in English.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:14-2:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 3:14, 15</a>) Although the divine name appears nearly 7,000 times in the Old Testament (Hebrew-​Aramaic Scriptures), many translations replace it with the title “LORD” (in capital letters). An example is in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a>, which refers prophetically to both Jehovah and Jesus. In the <em>King James Version,</em> we read: “The L<span class="altsize">ORD</span> [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Jesus].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:34-44:2:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:34-36</a>) The <em>New World Translation</em> removes any possible confusion between the two “Lords” by putting the divine name in its rightful place. It states: “Jehovah declared to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>A number of scholars believe that the divine name means “He Causes to Become.” Only the true God can live up to such a name, because he alone can cause himself or his creation to become whatever is necessary to fulfill his purpose.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span> As our Creator and the only true God, Jehovah deserves our exclusive devotion. No one else and nothing else is entitled to our worship, and this includes <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:502013270/">idols and images</a>.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:2-2:20:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 20:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 34:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:21</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>In the opening verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:1-23:42:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 42</a>, Jehovah foretold the work of his “chosen one.” This approved servant, God said, “will bring justice to the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:1-23:42:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:1</a>) Regarding that promise, God stated: “Now I am declaring new things. Before they spring up, I tell you about them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:9-23:42:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:9</a>) The prophecy about the “chosen one” sprang up, or came true, centuries later when the Messiah, or Christ, arrived and carried out his earthly ministry.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:16-40:3:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 3:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:15-40:12:21" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 12:15-21</a>.</p>
