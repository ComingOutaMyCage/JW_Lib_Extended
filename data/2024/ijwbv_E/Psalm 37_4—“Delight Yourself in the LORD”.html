<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Meaning of Psalm 37:4</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The psalmist urges worshippers of God to find joy in having a close friendship with Him. All who enjoy that friendship can be sure that Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> God will fulfill their legitimate desires.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah.”</strong> This expression can also be rendered “find your greatest joy in Jehovah,” “take delight in serving the LORD,” or “take delight in what the LORD has promised you.” Put simply, we should “find [our] greatest joy” in worshipping the true God. (Psalm 37:4, footnote) Why is that the case?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Those who worship Jehovah view matters from his perspective, as revealed in the Bible. They not only know God but also have the wisdom to obey him. As a result, they maintain a good conscience and avoid many of life’s pitfalls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>) For example, they are not consumed with anger or envy when greedy or dishonest people seem to prosper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:1-19:37:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:7-19:37:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7-9</a>) God’s people are happy in the knowledge that he will soon end all injustice and reward the faithful for their good conduct. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:34-19:37:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:34</a>) They also take great joy in knowing that they have their heavenly Father’s smile of approval.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:12-19:5:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>“He will grant you the desires of your heart.”</strong> These words can also be translated “he will answer your prayers” or “he will give you what you desire most.” Of course, Jehovah will not grant just any request. Like a good parent, Jehovah knows what is best for His children. Moreover, our petitions, along with our lifestyle, must harmonize with <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502018856&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018856&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">his standards and his will</a>.

He wrote the psalm in an alphabetic, or acrostic, style.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>David suffered many injustices. He was hunted by King Saul and others who wanted to kill him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:1-10:22:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:1</a>) Yet, David always had complete trust in his God. David knew that Jehovah would eventually call the wicked to account. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>) Even if they appear to prosper, like “green new grass” they will eventually be gone.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:2-19:37:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 37:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:20-19:37:20" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:35-19:37:36" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 35, 36</a>.</p>
