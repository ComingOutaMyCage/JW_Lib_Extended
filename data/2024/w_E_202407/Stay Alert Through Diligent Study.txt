Stay Alert Through Diligent Study

Read Daniel 9:1-19 to learn the importance of diligent study.
Analyze the context. What events had recently occurred, and how did they affect Daniel? (Dan. 5:29–6:5) How would you have felt if you were Daniel?
Dig deeper. Which “sacred books” might Daniel have consulted? (Dan. 9:2, ftn.; w11 1/1 22 ¶2) Why did Daniel confess his sins and those of the nation of Israel? (Lev. 26:39-42; 1 Ki. 8:46-50; dp 182-184) How does Daniel’s prayer show that he was a diligent student of God’s Word?​—Dan. 9:11-13.
Identify the lessons. Ask yourself:
  ‘How can I avoid being distracted by world events?’ (Mic. 7:7)

  ‘How will I benefit by studying God’s Word diligently, as Daniel did?’ (w04 8/1 12 ¶17)

  ‘What personal study topics will help me to “keep on the watch”?’ (Matt. 24:42, 44; w12 8/15 5 ¶7-8)
