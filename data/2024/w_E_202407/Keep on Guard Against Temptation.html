But each one of us has areas of vulnerability, whether it is to commit a serious sin, to engage in some form of unclean conduct, or to fall prey to worldly thinking. For example, one person may be fighting temptation to commit sexual immorality. Another might be strongly inclined toward unclean practices, such as masturbation or viewing pornography. Still another may be struggling with fear of man, independent thinking, a quick temper, or something else.

He committed sexual immorality with an immoral woman. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:22-20:7:22" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Verse 22</a> tells us that the young man went after her “suddenly.” But as the preceding verses show, he had taken several steps before this that <strong><em>gradually</em></strong> led him to sin.</p>

Instead, he accepted her kiss and listened as she spoke of the communion sacrifices she had offered, perhaps in an attempt to make him think that she was not a bad person. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:13-20:7:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 7:13, 14,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:21-20:7:21" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> <strong>21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Had the young man avoided the dangers that led up to the sin, he would have guarded himself from the temptations and from the sin.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[56]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Solomon’s account illustrates what can happen to any worshipper of Jehovah. He might fall into serious sin and later feel that everything occurred “suddenly.” Or he might say, “It just happened.” And yet, if he thinks about what actually occurred, he will likely discover that he took some unwise steps that led to his transgression. Those steps might have involved bad association, unwholesome entertainment, or frequenting questionable places​—whether in person or online. Perhaps he had also stopped praying, reading the Bible, attending meetings, or sharing in the ministry. Like the young man discussed in Proverbs, he may not have committed the sin so “suddenly” after all.</p>

But such thinking is wrong. A person who dwells on a wrong desire intensifies the desire. In a sense, he creates a temptation, which he will now have to resist. Of course, wrong thoughts will at times come into our mind. The key is to reject these thoughts immediately and replace them with good ones. When we do, we keep wrong thoughts from growing into a powerful desire that is hard to fight and that might even lead us to committing a serious sin.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:2-51:3:2" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Col. 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:13-59:1:15" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jas. 1:13-15</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:69-40:26:75" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 26:69-75</a>) Peter seemed to have overcome that fear when he gave a bold witness before the Sanhedrin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:29" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:27-29</a>) However, some years later, “fearing those of the circumcised class,” he temporarily stopped eating with Gentile Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:11-48:2:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gal. 2:11, 12</a>) Peter’s fear had returned. Perhaps he was never completely free of it.</p>

A tendency that we thought we had put behind us might return to tempt us again. For example, one brother admits: “I resisted pornography for ten years and convinced myself that my problem was over. But the addiction was lying dormant, waiting for the right circumstance to rear its ugly head.” Commendably, he did not <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>give up. He realized that he would need to put forth a daily effort to resist this vice​—perhaps for the rest of his life in this system of things. With the help of his wife and his congregation elders, he took stronger measures to resist pornography.</p>

By following Jesus’ counsel with regard to temptation: “Keep on the watch.” Even during periods when you feel strong, continue to avoid situations that can lead to temptation.
