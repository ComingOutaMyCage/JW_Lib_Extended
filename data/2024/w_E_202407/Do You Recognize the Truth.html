Consider the example of the 12 chieftains who spied out the land that Jehovah had promised to give to the Israelites. For ten of the spies, their fear of the Canaanites was stronger than their love for Jehovah. They told their fellow Israelites: “We are not able to go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:27-4:13:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Num. 13:27-31</a>) From a human standpoint, the Canaanites were stronger than the Israelites​—that part was true. But to say that the Israelites <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>would not be able to conquer their enemies left Jehovah out of the picture. Those ten spies should have focused on what Jehovah wanted the Israelites to do. They should also have meditated on what he had done for them in the recent past. Then they would have realized that the strength of the Canaanites was nothing in comparison to Jehovah’s almighty power. Unlike those faithless spies, Joshua and Caleb wanted to have Jehovah’s approval.
