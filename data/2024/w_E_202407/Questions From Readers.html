<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:1-23:60:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:1</a> reads: “Arise, O woman, shed light, for your light has come. The glory of Jehovah shines on you.” The context shows that the “woman” was Zion, or Jerusalem, the capital of Judah at that time.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:14-23:60:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 60:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:1-23:62:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 62:1, 2</a>) The city stands for the entire nation. Isaiah’s words raise two questions: First, when and how did Jerusalem “arise” and shed spiritual light? Second, are Isaiah’s words having a greater fulfillment in our time?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong><em>When and how did Jerusalem “arise” and shed spiritual light?</em></strong> Jerusalem and its temple lay in ruins while the Jews were in exile in Babylon for 70 years. But after Babylon fell to the Medes and the Persians, Israelites from all over the Babylonian Empire were free to return to their homeland and restore true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:1-15:1:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) Beginning in 537 B.C.E., a faithful remnant from all 12 tribes did so. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:4-23:60:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 60:4</a>) They began to offer sacrifices to Jehovah, to celebrate the festivals, and to rebuild the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:1-15:3:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:7-15:3:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:16-15:6:22" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 6:16-22</a>) Once again, Jehovah’s glory started to shine on Jerusalem​—that is, God’s restored people. They, in turn, became a source of enlightenment to the nations, which were in spiritual darkness.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">However, Isaiah’s restoration prophecies were only partially fulfilled on ancient Jerusalem. The Israelites in general did not continue to obey God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:27-16:13:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 13:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:6-39:1:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Mal. 1:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:13-39:2:14" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:7-40:15:9" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Matt. 15:7-9</a>) Later, they even rejected the Messiah, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:1-40:27:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 27:1, 2</a>) In 70 C.E., Jerusalem and its temple were destroyed the second time.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6">Jehovah foretold that tragic outcome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24-27</a>) Clearly, it was not his purpose for earthly Jerusalem to fulfill every aspect of the restoration prophecies in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:1-23:60:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 60</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong><em>Are Isaiah’s words having a greater fulfillment in our time?</em></strong> Yes, but in regard to another symbolic woman​—<strong><em>“the Jerusalem above.”</em></strong> The apostle Paul wrote about her: “She is our mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:26-48:4:26" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gal. 4:26</a>) Jerusalem above is the heavenly part of God’s organization, which is made up of loyal spirit creatures. Her children include Jesus and the 144,000 spirit-anointed Christians, who like Paul have a heavenly hope. The anointed Christians make up “a holy nation”​—“the Israel of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8">How did the Jerusalem above “arise” and “shed light”? She did so through her earthly anointed children. Compare their experiences with what was prophesied in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:1-23:60:22" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 60</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9">The anointed Christians had to “arise” because they had gone into a spiritually dark state when the foretold weeds of apostasy overwhelmed them in the second century C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:37-40:13:43" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 13:37-43</a>) They thus became captives to Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. The anointed remained captive until “the conclusion of the system of things,” a period that began in the year 1914. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:39-40:13:40" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 13:39, 40</a>) Soon <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>thereafter, in 1919, they were set free and immediately began to shed spiritual light by throwing themselves into the preaching work.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Over the years, people from all nations have come to that light, including the remaining ones of the Israel of God​—the “kings” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:3-23:60:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:3</a>.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 5:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10">In the future, anointed Christians will reflect divine light in an even greater way. How so? When they finish their earthly course, they will become part of “New Jerusalem,” or Christ’s bride of 144,000 fellow kings and priests.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 21:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:24-66:21:24" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:3-66:22:5" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 22:3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11">New Jerusalem will play a key role in fulfilling <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:1-23:60:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:1</a>. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:1-23:60:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:3-23:60:3" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:5-23:60:5" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:11-23:60:11" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:19-23:60:20" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> 19, 20</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:11" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 9-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:22-66:21:26" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 22-26</a>.) Just as earthly Jerusalem was the seat of government in ancient Israel, so New Jerusalem and Christ will become the government of the new system of things. How does New Jerusalem “[come] down out of heaven from God”? By directing its attention to the earth. God-fearing people out of all nations “will walk by means of its light.” They will even be set free from sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 21:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:24-66:21:24" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 24</a>) The result will be the complete “restoration of all things,” as Isaiah and other prophets foretold. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:21-44:3:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 3:21</a>) That grand restoration began when Christ became King and will conclude at the end of his Thousand Year Reign.</p>

<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> The spiritual restoration that took place in 1919 is also described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:1-14 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:7-66:11:12" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:7-12</a>. Ezekiel foretold the spiritual restoration of <strong><em>all anointed Christians</em></strong> after a very long period of captivity. The prophecy in Revelation refers to the spiritual rebirth of <strong><em>a small group of anointed brothers who have taken the lead</em></strong> after a short period of forced inactivity as a result of unjust imprisonment. In 1919, they were appointed as “the faithful and discreet slave.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017938/"><em>Pure Worship of Jehovah​—Restored At Last!,</em> p. 118</a>.</p></div>
