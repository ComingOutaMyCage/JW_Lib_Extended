Marco says: “From the day your children are born, you love them so much. You would do anything to protect them from harm. So when they choose to leave Jehovah, it is heartbreaking.” He continues: “But Jehovah has been by our side. He has made sure that when <strong><em>I</em></strong> am weak, my wife is strong, and when <strong><em>she</em></strong> is weak, I am strong.” Sidse adds: “We would not have been able to endure if Jehovah had not provided us with the strength we needed. I was struggling with the feeling that it was my fault, so I told Jehovah how I felt. After a short time, a sister whom I hadn’t seen for many years came up to me, laid her hands on my shoulders, looked me in the eyes, and said: ‘Remember, Sidse, it is not your fault!’ With Jehovah’s help, I have managed to maintain my joy in serving him.”</p>
