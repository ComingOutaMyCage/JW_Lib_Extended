SONG 73 Grant Us Boldness

Be Courageous Like Zadok


“Zadok [was] a mighty and courageous young man.”​—1 CHRON. 12:28.


FOCUS
How Zadok’s example can help us to be courageous.


1-2. Who was Zadok? (1 Chronicles 12:22, 26-28)

Your answer


PICTURE the scene. A crowd of over 340,000 men had gathered to make David king over all of Israel. For three days, the sounds of animated conversation, joyful songs of praise, and lighthearted laughter echoed throughout the rocky hills near Hebron. (1 Chron. 12:39) A young man named Zadok would not likely have stood out in that large crowd. However, Jehovah made sure that we would know that Zadok was there. (Read 1 Chronicles 12:22, 26-28.) Who was Zadok?
2 Zadok was a priest who worked closely with High Priest Abiathar. Zadok was also a seer who was able to discern the divine will and who was granted extraordinary insight. (2 Sam. 15:27) People would turn to Zadok when they needed wise advice. He was also a man of courage. It is this aspect of his personality that we will focus on in this article.
 3. (a) Why do Jehovah’s worshippers need to be courageous? (b) What will we discuss in this article?

Your answers


3 During these last days, Satan is intensifying his attacks on God’s people. (1 Pet. 5:8) We need to be courageous as we wait on Jehovah to put an end to Satan and his wicked system. (Ps. 31:24) Let us consider three ways that we can imitate Zadok’s courage.
SUPPORT GOD’S KINGDOM
 4. Why do Jehovah’s people need courage to support God’s Kingdom? (See also picture.)

Your answer


4 As Jehovah’s people, we wholeheartedly support God’s Kingdom, but we often need courage to do so. (Matt. 6:33) For example, in this wicked world, we need courage to live by Jehovah’s standards and to preach the Kingdom good news. (1 Thess. 2:2) And it often takes courage to remain politically neutral in this increasingly divided system of things. (John 18:36) Many among Jehovah’s people have suffered financial loss, have been physically abused, or have been imprisoned because of refusing to participate in political or military activity.




When others take sides in politics, what will you do? (See paragraph 4)




 5. Why did Zadok need courage to support David?

Your answer


5 Zadok did not go to Hebron just to celebrate David’s kingship. He went there armed and ready for battle. (1 Chron. 12:38) He was willing to follow David into battle and to defend Israel from its enemies. What Zadok possibly lacked in experience as a warrior, he made up for in courage.
 6. How did David set a good example of courage for Zadok to follow? (Psalm 138:3)

Your answer


6 Where did a priest like Zadok learn to be so courageous? He was surrounded by men who were strong and courageous. No doubt he benefited from their example. For instance, David’s example of courageously “leading Israel on its campaigns” moved all of Israel to support him wholeheartedly. (1 Chron. 11:1, 2) David always relied on Jehovah for help against his enemies. (Ps. 28:7; read Psalm 138:3.) Zadok had other inspiring examples right by his side​—men such as Jehoiada and his warrior son Benaiah as well as the 22 other tribal chiefs who rallied to David’s side. (1 Chron. 11:22-25; 12:26-28) These men all took decisive action to support David’s kingship.
 7. (a) What modern-day examples of courage can we learn from? (b) What do you learn from Brother Nsilu’s example, as related in the video?

Your answers


7 We gain strength and courage when we consider the examples of those who have courageously supported Jehovah’s rulership. Our King, Christ Jesus, firmly resisted pressure to become involved in Satan’s political system of things. (Matt. 4:8-11; John 6:14, 15) He always relied on Jehovah for strength. We also have countless modern-day examples of young men who have taken a stand as conscientious objectors or who have refused to participate in political activities.

HELP YOUR BROTHERS
 8. When might elders need courage in order to provide practical help to their brothers?

Your answer


8 Jehovah’s people love to help one another. (2 Cor. 8:4) However, at times, it takes courage to do so. For example, when a war breaks out, the local elders realize that their brothers and sisters need encouragement, support, and perhaps spiritual or physical provisions. Out of love for the sheep, the elders put their own safety at risk in order to provide what is needed. (John 15:12, 13) In this regard, they follow Zadok’s courageous example.
 9. As reported at 2 Samuel 15:27-29, what did David direct Zadok to do? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 David’s life was in danger. His son Absalom was determined to steal the kingdom from him. (2 Sam. 15:12, 13) David needed to leave Jerusalem at once! He called out to his servants: “Get up, and let us run away, for none of us will escape from Absalom!” (2 Sam. 15:14) As the servants were leaving, David realized that someone needed to stay back to keep him informed of Absalom’s plans. So he sent Zadok and other priests back into the city to serve as informants. (Read 2 Samuel 15:27-29.) They had to proceed cautiously. What David told those priests to do was risky and even life-threatening. Imagine what Absalom​—an egotistical, vengeful, and treacherous man—​would have done to Zadok and the other priests if he had found out that they were spying on him to protect David!




David sent Zadok on a dangerous mission (See paragraph 9)




10. How did Zadok and those with him protect David?

Your answer


10 David worked out a plan that involved Zadok and Hushai, another loyal friend of David’s. (2 Sam. 15:32-37) Following the plan, Hushai won the confidence of Absalom and recommended a military strategy that would give David time to prepare for an attack. Next, Hushai informed Zadok and Abiathar of the plan. (2 Sam. 17:8-16) The two men were then able to send a message to David. (2 Sam. 17:17) With Jehovah’s help, Zadok and his fellow priests played an important role in protecting David’s life.​—2 Sam. 17:21, 22.
11. How can we imitate Zadok’s courage when helping our brothers?

Your answer


11 If we are called on to help our brothers during dangerous times, how can we show courage like that of Zadok? (1) Follow direction. In such circumstances, it is important that we remain united. Cooperate with the direction from your local branch office. (Heb. 13:17) Elders should regularly review local arrangements for disaster preparedness as well as organizational direction on what to do when a disaster is imminent. (1 Cor. 14:33, 40) (2) Be courageous but cautious. (Prov. 22:3) Use common sense. Do not take unnecessary risks. (3) Rely on Jehovah. Remember that Jehovah is deeply interested in the well-being of both you and your brothers. He can help you to assist your brothers safely.
12-13. What do you learn from the experiences of Viktor and Vitalii? (See also picture.)

Your answer


12 Consider Viktor and Vitalii, two spiritual brothers who worked to deliver food and water to their fellow believers in Ukraine. “We looked everywhere for food,” says Viktor. “Often there was shooting around us. One brother donated food from his store. This donation gave many publishers what they needed to survive for some time. As we were loading items into our truck, a rocket landed about 20 meters (66 ft) away from us. Throughout the day, I implored Jehovah to give me the courage I needed to continue to help the publishers.”
13 “It called for a lot of courage,” says Vitalii. “My first trip took 12 hours. I prayed to Jehovah the whole way.” Vitalii was courageous, but he was also cautious. He adds: “I kept asking Jehovah for wisdom and modesty. I drove only on the roads approved by the authorities. I have benefited from seeing firsthand how the brothers and sisters worked together. They cleared obstacles from the road, collected and loaded humanitarian aid, and provided us with food and places to rest along the way.”




During dangerous times, be courageous but cautious when helping your brothers (See paragraphs 12-13)




REMAIN LOYAL TO JEHOVAH
14. How may we be affected if someone we love becomes disloyal to Jehovah?

Your answer


14 Few trials can leave us feeling more discouraged than when a family member or a close friend leaves Jehovah. (Ps. 78:40; Prov. 24:10) The closer our bond is with the person, the more difficult it can be to accept the situation. If you have had such a painful experience, Zadok’s example of loyalty can strengthen you.
15. Why did Zadok need courage to remain loyal to Jehovah? (1 Kings 1:5-8)

Your answer


15 Zadok remained loyal to Jehovah when his close associate Abiathar chose to be disloyal. This happened at the end of David’s reign. As David lay on his deathbed, his son Adonijah tried to seize the throne that Jehovah had promised to Solomon. (1 Chron. 22:9, 10) Abiathar chose to support Adonijah. (Read 1 Kings 1:5-8.) In doing so, Abiathar was being disloyal not only to David but also to Jehovah! Can you imagine how sad and disappointed Zadok must have felt? For some four decades, he and Abiathar had worked closely together as priests. (2 Sam. 8:17) They had cared for “the Ark of the true God” together. (2 Sam. 15:29) Initially, both men had supported David’s kingship​—and so much more.​—2 Sam. 19:11-14.
16. What may have helped Zadok to remain loyal?

Your answer


16 Zadok remained loyal to Jehovah despite Abiathar’s choice. David never doubted Zadok’s loyalty. When Adonijah’s scheme was revealed, David turned to Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah to anoint Solomon as king. (1 Ki. 1:32-34) Being with loyal worshippers of Jehovah, such as Nathan and other supporters of King David, must have strengthened and encouraged Zadok. (1 Ki. 1:38, 39) When Solomon became king, he “appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.”​—1 Ki. 2:35.
17. How can you imitate Zadok if someone close to you becomes disloyal to Jehovah?

Your answer


17 How can you imitate Zadok? If someone close to you chooses to leave Jehovah, make your choice clear. (Josh. 24:15) Jehovah will give you the strength and the courage you need. Rely on him through prayer and by staying close to fellow loyal worshippers. Jehovah treasures your loyalty, and he will reward you for it.​—2 Sam. 22:26.
18. What do you learn from Marco and Sidse’s experience?

Your answer


18 Consider the example of Marco and his wife, Sidse, whose two adult daughters left the truth. Marco says: “From the day your children are born, you love them so much. You would do anything to protect them from harm. So when they choose to leave Jehovah, it is heartbreaking.” He continues: “But Jehovah has been by our side. He has made sure that when I am weak, my wife is strong, and when she is weak, I am strong.” Sidse adds: “We would not have been able to endure if Jehovah had not provided us with the strength we needed. I was struggling with the feeling that it was my fault, so I told Jehovah how I felt. After a short time, a sister whom I hadn’t seen for many years came up to me, laid her hands on my shoulders, looked me in the eyes, and said: ‘Remember, Sidse, it is not your fault!’ With Jehovah’s help, I have managed to maintain my joy in serving him.”
19. What are you determined to do?

Your answer


19 Jehovah wants all his worshippers to be courageous like Zadok. (2 Tim. 1:7) However, He does not want us to rely on our own strength. He wants us to rely on him. So when you find yourself in a situation where you need courage, turn to Jehovah. You can be sure that he will make you as courageous as Zadok was!​—1 Pet. 5:10.
