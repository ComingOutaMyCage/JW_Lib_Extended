<div class="boxContent"><p id="p83" data-pid="83">Consider the example of King Manasseh, who “did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.” He “shed innocent blood in very great quantity,” engaged in various forms of spiritism, and even offered his sons in sacrifice to false gods! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:6-12:21:6" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:16-12:21:16" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 16</a>) He influenced the nation of Judah to “do greater evil than the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:9-12:21:9" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:1-14:33:6" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 33:1-6</a>) But when Manasseh was taken captive to Babylon, he repented. This involved more than one appeal for forgiveness. After all, he had made a practice of grave sin over a long period of time. In his distress, Manasseh <strong><em>“kept</em></strong> humbling himself” and <strong><em>“kept</em></strong> praying.” With what result? Jehovah heard Manasseh and “was <strong><em>moved by</em></strong> his entreaty.” Jehovah forgave him and restored him to Jerusalem and to his kingship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:12-14:33:13" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84">Will Jehovah deal similarly with others who have left true worship but who show genuine, heartfelt repentance? Yes, for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:7</a> states: “Let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man his thoughts; let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy on him, to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.” So do not hesitate to take the necessary steps to return to Jehovah!</p>
