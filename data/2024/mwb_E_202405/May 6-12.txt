TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. “Do Not Be Upset Because of Evil Men”

Wicked people cause us pain and anguish (Ps 36:1-4; w17.04 10 ¶4)
Harboring anger against “evil men” also causes us harm (Ps 37:1, 7, 8; w22.06 10 ¶10)
Trusting in Jehovah’s promises gives us peace (Ps 37:10, 11; w03 12/1 13 ¶20)







ASK YOURSELF, ‘Do I pay too much attention to news events that feature wicked acts?’

7. Are You Prepared for “Times of Distress”?


(15 min.) Discussion.

Brothers and sisters all over the world suffer tragedy and loss because of natural and man-made disasters. (Ps 9:9, 10) Sadly, the reality is that “times of distress” can strike at any time, so we all need to be prepared to face such trials.
In addition to making physical preparations,a what can help us to cope when a disaster occurs?
  Prepare mentally: Acknowledge that disasters happen, and consider what to do if one occurs. Avoid becoming overly attached to material belongings. This will help you to act wisely and decisively, giving your safety and life priority over your possessions. (Ge 19:16; Ps 36:9) It will also help you after a disaster strikes to have realistic expectations, and it may reduce the emotional distress of material loss.​—Ps 37:19

  Prepare spiritually: Cultivate trust in Jehovah’s ability and desire to care for you. (Ps 37:18) Before a disaster strikes, regularly remind yourself that Jehovah will guide and support his servants even though we may survive with only ‘our lives as spoil.’​—Jer 45:5; Ps 37:23, 24


By keeping Jehovah’s promises clear in mind, we make him our “fortress in the time of distress.”​—Ps 37:39.
