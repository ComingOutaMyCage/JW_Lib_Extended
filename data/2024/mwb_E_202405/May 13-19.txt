TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. Shedding the Burden of Excessive Guilt


(10 min.)

Excessive guilt can feel like a crushing burden (Ps 38:3-8; w20.11 27 ¶12-13)
Rather than focusing on past mistakes, be determined to make future days count before Jehovah (Ps 39:4, 5; w02 11/15 20 ¶1-2)
Pray even if feelings of guilt make it difficult to do so (Ps 39:12; w21.10 15 ¶4)







If you deal with feelings of excessive guilt, remember that Jehovah forgives repentant sinners “in a large way.”​—Isa 55:7.
