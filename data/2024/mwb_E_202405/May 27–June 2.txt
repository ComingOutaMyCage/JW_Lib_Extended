Young ones, are you planning what you will do after you finish high school? You may already have a job in mind that will allow you to pioneer. Or perhaps you are considering whether there are additional courses you could take that would give you a skill, a license, or a diploma that would help you to find such a job. This is an exciting time in your life! Still, you may feel overwhelmed by your options or feel pressure to make a decision that will please others. What can help you to make wise decisions?
Read Matthew 6:32, 33. Then ask the audience:
  Why is it good to have clear spiritual goals in mind before making important decisions about work and education?

Be careful not to let a desire for financial security or prestige influence your decisions. (1Jo 2:15, 17) Remember, just having a lot materially can make it difficult for a person to accept the Kingdom message. (Lu 18:24-27) Pursuing material wealth is incompatible with spiritual growth and success.​—Mt 6:24; Mr 8:36.
