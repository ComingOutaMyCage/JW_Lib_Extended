(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah appreciates all the work that faithful older ones do in the congregation, and so do we. (Heb 6:10) Over the years, they have done much to teach, train, and encourage fellow worshippers. Likely, you can think of ways that they have helped you. How can you show your appreciation for all that they have done and continue to do in the congregation?
