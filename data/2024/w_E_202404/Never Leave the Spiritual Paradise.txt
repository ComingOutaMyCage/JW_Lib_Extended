SONG 111 Our Reasons for Joy

Never Leave the Spiritual Paradise


“Exult and be joyful forever in what I am creating.”​—ISA. 65:18.


FOCUS
Learn how the spiritual paradise benefits us and how we can draw others to it.


 1. What is the spiritual paradise, and what should we be determined to do?

Your answer


THERE is a paradise on earth today that is full of life and activity. It is teeming with millions of people who enjoy genuine peace. Those who are already in this paradise are determined never to leave it. They also want as many people as possible to join them in this unique setting. What is it? The spiritual paradise!a
 2. What is amazing about the spiritual paradise?

Your answer


2 Amazingly, Jehovah has created a serene environment in the midst of a world that Satan has turned into a hate-filled, wicked, and dangerous place. (1 John 5:19; Rev. 12:12) Our loving God sees the damaging effects of this system of things and provides the security that we need in order to flourish spiritually. His Word describes the spiritual paradise as both a safe “refuge” and a “well-watered garden.” (Isa. 4:6; 58:11) With Jehovah’s blessing, those inhabiting this paradise are able to thrive during these difficult last days.​—Isa. 54:14; 2 Tim. 3:1.
 3. What was the ancient fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 65?

Your answer


3 By means of the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah described what it would be like for those who would dwell in the spiritual paradise. You can find this description in Isaiah chapter 65, which had an initial fulfillment back in 537 B.C.E. At that time, repentant Jews were released from captivity in Babylon and they returned to their homeland. Jehovah blessed his people and helped them to make the devastated city of Jerusalem beautiful again and to restore its temple as the center of true worship in Israel.​—Isa. 51:11; Zech. 8:3.
 4. What is the modern-day fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 65?

Your answer


4 A second fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy began in 1919 C.E. when Jehovah’s modern-day worshippers were set free from captivity to Babylon the Great. Then the spiritual paradise started to take shape throughout the earth. Zealous Kingdom proclaimers formed many congregations and produced spiritual fruitage. Men and women who once exhibited violent, animalistic tendencies “put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will.” (Eph. 4:24) Of course, many of the blessings that Isaiah described will be fulfilled literally in the future new world. But even now there are rich benefits that we are enjoying. Let us see how this spiritual paradise affects us and why we should never leave it.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE IN THE SPIRITUAL PARADISE
 5. As promised at Isaiah 65:13, what do we enjoy within the spiritual paradise?

Your answer


5 Healthy and refreshed. Isaiah’s prophecy draws a vivid contrast between what life is like for those inside the spiritual paradise and what life is like for those outside. (Read Isaiah 65:13.) Jehovah abundantly satisfies the spiritual needs of his worshippers. We have his holy spirit, his written Word, and ample spiritual food so that we can “eat, . . . drink, . . . [and] rejoice.” (Compare Revelation 22:17.) In sharp contrast, those who are outside the spiritual paradise “go hungry . . . , go thirsty . . . , [and] suffer shame.” Their spiritual needs are not being satisfied.​—Amos 8:11.
 6. How does Joel 2:21-24 describe our spiritual provisions, and how can they benefit us?

Your answer


6 In his prophecy, Joel used such staples of life as grain, wine, and olive oil to show that Jehovah generously supplies His people with what they need, including spiritual food. (Joel 2:21-24) He does so through the Bible and our Bible-based publications, our website, as well as our meetings, assemblies, and conventions. We can partake of spiritual provisions every day, and as a result, we feel healthier and more refreshed.
 7. What gives us a “good condition of the heart”? (Isaiah 65:14)

Your answer


7 Happy and content. God’s people can “shout joyfully” because their heart overflows with appreciation. (Read Isaiah 65:14.) The upbuilding truths and comforting promises in God’s Word and our solid hope based on Christ’s ransom sacrifice give us a “good condition of the heart.” Talking about these things with our spiritual brothers and sisters makes us truly happy!​—Ps. 34:8; 133:1-3.
 8. What are two major characteristics of the spiritual paradise?

Your answer


8 The love and the unity among Jehovah’s people are two major characteristics of the spiritual paradise. This “bond of union” gives us an idea of what life will be like in the new world, where Jehovah’s servants will enjoy even greater love and unity than they do today. (Col. 3:14) A Christian sister relates what she noticed about Jehovah’s people when she first met them: “I did not know how to be happy, not even in my family. The first time I saw love in action was among Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Anyone who wants to be truly happy and content needs to experience our spiritual paradise. No matter what this world thinks of Jehovah’s servants, they have an honorable name, or reputation, with his universal family.​—Isa. 65:15.
 9. What does Isaiah 65:16, 17 promise about life’s distresses?

Your answer


9 Relaxed and calm. Isaiah 65:14 says that those who choose to remain outside the spiritual paradise “cry out because of the pain of heart [and] wail because of a broken spirit.” But what about all the things that have caused God’s people pain and distress? Eventually, those things “will be forgotten [and] concealed from [God’s] eyes.” (Read Isaiah 65:16, 17.) Jehovah will make our troubles go away, and in time the pain of such memories will vanish completely.
10. Why do you feel that it is a blessing to associate with Christian brothers and sisters? (See also picture.)

Your answer


10 Even now, it is soothing to our nerves to be at our Christian meetings, where we can relax and put behind us the stresses of this wicked world. We contribute to the calmness of our spiritual environment when we manifest the love, joy, peace, kindness, and mildness that are included in the fruitage of God’s spirit. (Gal. 5:22, 23) What a blessing it is for us to be associated with God’s organization! Those who remain in the spiritual paradise will see the complete fulfillment of God’s promise of “new heavens and a new earth.”




It is a blessing to enjoy the spiritual paradise as part of God’s family (See paragraph 10)c




11. According to Isaiah 65:18, 19, how should the spiritual paradise that Jehovah has created affect us?

Your answer


11 Grateful and excited. Isaiah goes on to reveal why we have every reason to “exult and be joyful” in the spiritual paradise. This environment is a creation of Jehovah. (Read Isaiah 65:18, 19.) No wonder he is using us to direct people away from the spiritually parched organizations of this old world and into our beautiful spiritual environment! We are excited about the blessings we enjoy because of being in the truth, and we are moved to tell others about them.​—Jer. 31:12.
12. How do the promises described at Isaiah 65:20-24 make you feel, and why?

Your answer


12 We are also grateful for and excited about the hope we have as residents of the spiritual paradise. Just think of all that we will see and do in God’s new world! The Bible promises: “No more will there be an infant . . . who lives but a few days, nor an old man who fails to live out his days.” We will “build houses and live in them [and] plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.” We will “not toil for nothing” because we will be “blessed by Jehovah.” He promises us a secure, satisfying life with a real purpose. “Even before they call out,” he will know each one’s needs and “satisfy the desire of every living thing.”​—Isa. 65:20-24; Ps. 145:16.
13. How does Isaiah 65:25 describe the changes that people make in their life when they begin serving Jehovah?

Your answer


13 Peaceful and safe. With the help of God’s spirit, many who formerly had beastly personalities have made remarkable changes in their life. (Read Isaiah 65:25.) They have tamed their former undesirable traits. (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:22-24) Granted, God’s people are still imperfect, so we will continue to make mistakes. However, Jehovah has united “all sorts of people” in an unbreakable bond of love and peace. (Titus 2:11) This is a miracle that only the almighty God could perform!
14. How has Isaiah 65:25 proved to be true in one brother’s case?

Your answer


14 Can people really change their personality? Consider this experience. A young man who had been in and out of prison by the age of 20 was deeply involved in immoral and violent behavior. He had been jailed for car theft, burglary, and other serious crimes. He was ready to fight with anyone. When he first heard the truth from the Bible and began attending meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he was convinced that he had found something to live for​—the spiritual paradise. After becoming a baptized Witness, he often thought of how Isaiah 65:25 applied to him. He had changed from being a lionlike, violent person to being a lamblike, peaceful person.
15. Why do we want to invite others to join us in the spiritual paradise, and how can we do so?

Your answer


15 Isaiah 65:13 begins with the declaration: “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.” Verse 25 ends with the words “says Jehovah.” His words always come true. (Isa. 55:10, 11) The spiritual paradise is already a reality. Jehovah has created a brotherhood that is truly unique. Among his people, we can find relative peace and enjoy a safe oasis in a violent world. (Ps. 72:7) For these reasons, we want to help as many as possible to join us in our Christian brotherhood. We can do this by focusing on making disciples.​—Matt. 28:19, 20.
HOW TO ATTRACT OTHERS TO THE SPIRITUAL PARADISE
16. How are people drawn to the spiritual paradise?

Your answer


16 Each of us has an important role to play in making the spiritual paradise attractive to others. We can fulfill this role if we imitate Jehovah. He does not drag people into his organization against their will. Instead, he gently “draws” people to himself. (John 6:44; Jer. 31:3) Good-hearted people who learn about Jehovah’s loving qualities and appealing personality are irresistibly drawn to him. How can we, by our good qualities and fine conduct, attract people to the spiritual paradise?
17. How can we attract others to the spiritual paradise?

Your answer


17 One way we can attract others to the spiritual paradise is by treating our fellow worshippers with love and kindness. When new ones attend our congregation meetings, we want them to come to the same conclusion as did the unbelievers who likely attended the meetings in ancient Corinth. They declared: “God is really among you.” (1 Cor. 14:24, 25; Zech. 8:23) Thus, we must continue to heed the counsel to “be peaceable with one another.”​—1 Thess. 5:13.
18. What may attract people to our organization?

Your answer


18 We should always try to see our Christian brothers and sisters as Jehovah sees them. We do so by focusing on their positive qualities and not on their imperfections, which will eventually disappear. We can resolve any differences between us in a spirit of love by always being “kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.” (Eph. 4:32) Then the spiritual paradise will attract people who want to be treated in a similar way.b
STAY INSIDE THE SPIRITUAL PARADISE
19. (a) As shown in the box “They Left and Came Back,” what have some said after returning to the spiritual paradise? (b) What should be our resolve? (See also picture.)

Your answers


19 How we appreciate our spiritual paradise! It is more beautiful than ever before, and it is inhabited by more praisers of Jehovah than ever before. May we be forever grateful for the paradise that Jehovah has created for us. Anyone who wants to be refreshed, content, calm, and safe must come into the spiritual paradise and never leave it! Beware, though, because Satan is trying his best to lure us away from it. (1 Pet. 5:8; Rev. 12:9) We must not allow him to succeed. Let us vigorously protect the beauty, purity, and peace of the spiritual paradise.




Those who remain in the spiritual paradise will also enjoy the future physical paradise (See paragraph 19)




They Left and Came Back
  June, who stopped attending congregation meetings and became inactive, finally returned to the spiritual paradise. She says: “What a wonderful feeling it was to be back with Jehovah’s people! . . . More than ever, I know that I cannot isolate myself or go it alone. I am thankful that there was still time for me to come back.”

  Kimberly was disfellowshipped for nearly 40 years. “I had no friends who served Jehovah and no spiritual food,” she relates. “I felt depressed and lonely.” But Kimberly repented and was reinstated in 2021. “Now I know that Jehovah hears and answers my prayers,” she says. “And once again, I am surrounded by people I can trust.” By depending on God’s spirit and by regularly feeding on God’s Word, she is feeling stronger mentally and spiritually.

  John returned to the spiritual paradise after being disfellowshipped for over 20 years. He says, “I had blocked the truth out of my mind along with the benefits of being with God’s people.” Now that he is reunited with his spiritual brothers and sisters and eating again from Jehovah’s table, he says, “There is no better life than one spent living among Jehovah’s family in the spiritual paradise!”
