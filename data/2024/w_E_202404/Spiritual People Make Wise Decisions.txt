Spiritual People Make Wise Decisions




Read Genesis 25:29-34 to learn whether Esau and Jacob made wise decisions.
Dig deeper into the context. What happened before? (Gen. 25:20-28) What happened afterward?​—Gen. 27:1-46.
Dig deeper into the details. In those days, what were the rights and duties of a firstborn son?​—Gen. 18:18, 19; w10 5/1 13.
  Did those rights always include being an ancestor of the Messiah? (w17.12 14-15)


Identify the lessons and apply them. Why did Jacob attribute a different value to the birthright than Esau did? (Heb. 12:16, 17; w03 10/15 28-29) How did Jehovah feel about the two brothers, and why? (Mal. 1:2, 3) What could Esau have done differently to make better decisions?
  Ask yourself, ‘How can I show appreciation for spiritual things in my weekly routine, such as when scheduling family worship?’
