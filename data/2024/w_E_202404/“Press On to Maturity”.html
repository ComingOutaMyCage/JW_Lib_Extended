A child lacks insight, so he needs the protection and supervision of an adult. To illustrate, a mother might ask her young daughter to hold her hand while crossing the street. As the girl grows older, the mother might allow her to cross the street on her own but will still remind her to look both ways for traffic. When the child becomes an adult, she avoids such hazards on her own. Just as young children need help from adults to avoid danger, immature Christians often need help from mature Christians to avoid spiritual dangers and <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>to make wise decisions. By contrast, when mature Christians have to make a decision, they reason on Bible principles to get Jehovah’s thinking on the matter and then follow through accordingly.</p>

Rather than tell them what to do, Paul acknowledged the role of the conscience and the fact that each person has a “right to choose.” He reasoned on principles that would allow each individual to be at peace with his conscience while not stumbling others.

Even though they had become full-grown Christians, Paul warned them against being ensnared by worldly thinking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:6-51:2:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Col. 2:6-10</a>) And Epaphras, who evidently knew those in the congregation well, prayed constantly that they might “finally stand complete,” or mature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:12-51:4:12" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Col. 4:12</a>) The point? Both Paul and Epaphras understood that maintaining maturity requires personal effort and God’s support. They wanted the Colossians to remain mature, or full-grown, Christians despite any challenges they were facing.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[77]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Paul warned the Hebrews that a mature Christian could permanently lose God’s approval. A Christian’s heart could become so hardened that he is no longer able to repent and receive God’s forgiveness. Thankfully, the Hebrews had not fallen away to that extent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:4-58:6:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb. 6:4-9</a>) What about those today who become inactive or are disfellowshipped but later repent? Their humble repentance shows that they are different from those whom Paul wrote about. However, when they return to Jehovah, they need the help that he provides. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:15-26:34:16" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezek. 34:15, 16</a>) The elders may arrange for an experienced Witness to help them regain their spiritual strength.</p>
