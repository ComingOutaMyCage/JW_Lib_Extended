Many publishers really enjoy the preaching work. But others struggle to find pleasure in it. Why? Some may be very shy and lack confidence. Some feel uncomfortable going to people’s homes uninvited. Some may fear being rejected. Some have been taught to avoid conflict with others. Despite loving Jehovah very much, these brothers and sisters find it hard to approach strangers with the good news. Yet, they realize how important this work is, and they regularly have a share in it. How pleased Jehovah must be!</p>

If so, do not be discouraged. Your lack of confidence may indicate that you humbly want to avoid drawing attention to yourself and do not want to be in the middle of controversy. And no one wants to be rejected, especially when he is trying to do good for others. Your heavenly Father is well-aware of the challenges you face and wants to give you the help you need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:13-23:41:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 41:13</a>) In this article, we will consider five suggestions on how to deal with such feelings and how to cultivate joy in the ministry.</p>

Take, for example, the prophet Jeremiah. He was hesitant when Jehovah gave him the assignment to preach. Jeremiah said: “I do not know how to speak, for I am just a boy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:6-24:1:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 1:6</a>) How did he overcome his lack of confidence? He drew strength from God’s word. He said: “It became like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was tired of holding it in.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:8-24:20:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 20:8, 9</a>) Although Jeremiah had a difficult territory, the message he was assigned to proclaim gave him the strength he needed to do the work.</p>

When writing to the congregation in Colossae, the apostle Paul said that taking in accurate knowledge would motivate his brothers “to walk worthily of Jehovah” as they continued “bearing fruit in every good work.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 1:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> That good work includes the preaching of the good news.
