When new ones attend our congregation meetings, we want them to come to the same conclusion as did the unbelievers who likely attended the meetings in ancient Corinth. They declared: “God is really among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:24-46:14:25" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Zech. 8:23</a>) Thus, we must continue to heed the counsel to “be peaceable with one another.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:13-52:5:13" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:13</a>.</p>
