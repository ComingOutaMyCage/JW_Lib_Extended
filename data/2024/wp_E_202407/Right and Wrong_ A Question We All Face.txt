Right and Wrong: A Question We All Face




If you wanted to travel somewhere that you have never been before, what would you do?
1. Head in the direction you think you should go.

2. Follow others, hoping that they know the way.

3. Consult a reliable guide, such as a GPS, a map, or a trusted friend who knows the way.


If we choose option one or two, we will get somewhere but not necessarily where we want to go. If we choose option three, however, we can confidently expect to reach our destination.
Our life is like a journey​—one that we hope will lead to a happy future. Whether we get there or not depends greatly on where we look for guidance when making decisions.
While most decisions we make will have little long-term effect on our life, some are more significant. They reflect our moral values​—our view of right and wrong. Such decisions will affect us and those we love for a long time, either for good or for bad. These decisions involve matters such as:
  Sex and marriage

  Honesty, work, and money

  How to raise children

  How to treat others


How can you be certain that your choices in these areas will lead to a happy future for you and your family?
The question each of us faces is this: What will guide the moral decisions I make?
This magazine will explain why the Bible is a reliable moral guide and how it can help you.
