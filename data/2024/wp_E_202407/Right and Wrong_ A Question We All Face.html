<ol class="source"><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="txtSrcBullet">1. </span>Head in the direction you think you should go.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="txtSrcBullet">2. </span>Follow others, hoping that they know the way.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6">If we choose option one or two, we will get somewhere but not necessarily where we want to go. If we choose option three, however, we can confidently expect to reach our destination.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7">Our life is like a journey​—one that we hope will lead to a happy future. Whether we get there or not depends greatly on where we look for guidance when making decisions.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8">While most decisions we make will have little long-term effect on our life, some are more significant. They reflect our moral values​—our view of right and wrong. Such decisions will affect us and those we love for a long time, either for good or for bad. These decisions involve matters such as:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9">  Sex and marriage</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10">  Honesty, work, and money</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11">  How to raise children</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12">  How to treat others</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13">How can you be certain that your choices in these areas will lead to a happy future for you and your family?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14">The question each of us faces is this: What will guide the moral decisions I make?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15">This magazine will explain why the Bible is a reliable moral guide and how it can help you.</p>
