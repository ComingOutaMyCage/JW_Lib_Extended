SONG 123 Loyally Submitting to Theocratic Order

Keep Following Jehovah’s Guidance


“I, Jehovah, am . . . the One guiding you.”​—ISA. 48:17.


FOCUS
This article will help us see how Jehovah guides his people today and what blessings we enjoy when we follow his guidance.


 1. Illustrate why we should follow Jehovah as our Guide.

Your answer


IMAGINE that you are lost in a forest. Danger lurks around you: wild animals, disease-carrying insects, poisonous plants, and rocky terrain. How grateful you would be for an experienced guide who knows where the danger is and how to steer you away from it! This world is like that forest. It is filled with danger that especially threatens our spiritual health. But we have a perfect Guide​—Jehovah. He leads us away from the danger and toward our destination​—everlasting life in the new world.
 2. How does Jehovah guide us?

Your answer


2 How does Jehovah guide us? Primarily, by means of his written Word, the Bible. However, he also uses human representatives. For example, he uses “the faithful and discreet slave” to provide spiritual food that helps us make wise decisions. (Matt. 24:45) Jehovah also uses other capable men to guide us. For example, circuit overseers and congregation elders provide encouragement and instruction that can help us get through difficult times. How grateful we are for reliable guidance during these critical last days! It helps us maintain Jehovah’s approval and keeps us on the road to life.
 3. What will we consider in this article?

Your answer


3 Even so, we might occasionally find it a challenge to follow Jehovah’s guidance, especially when it is conveyed by imperfect men. Why? The counsel may conflict with our likes or dislikes. Or we might feel that the direction we receive is unwise and conclude that the counsel must not be from Jehovah. At such times, we especially need confidence that Jehovah is the one leading his people and that following his guidance results in blessings. To help strengthen our confidence, this article will consider (1) how Jehovah guided his people in Bible times, (2) how he is guiding us today, and (3) how we benefit when we keep following his guidance.




From ancient times to the present day, Jehovah has used human representatives to guide his people (See paragraph 3)




HOW JEHOVAH GUIDED THE NATION OF ISRAEL
4-5. How did Jehovah show that he was using Moses to guide Israel? (See picture.)

Your answer


4 Jehovah appointed Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. And He gave the Israelites visible evidence that He was guiding them by means of Moses. For example, He provided a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night. (Ex. 13:21) Moses followed the pillar, which led him and the Israelites to the Red Sea. The people panicked when they thought that they were trapped between the sea and the pursuing Egyptian army. They concluded that Moses was mistaken in bringing them to the Red Sea. But it was no mistake. Jehovah had intentionally led his people there by means of Moses. (Ex. 14:2) God then delivered them in a most astonishing way.​—Ex. 14:26-28.




Moses depended on the pillar of cloud to guide God’s people through the wilderness (See paragraphs 4-5)




5 For 40 years thereafter, Moses continued to depend on the pillar of cloud to guide God’s people through the wilderness.a For a time, Jehovah placed the pillar above Moses’ tent, where all Israel could see it. (Ex. 33:7, 9, 10) From the pillar Jehovah spoke to Moses, who in turn conveyed His instructions to the people. (Ps. 99:7) The Israelites had ample evidence that Jehovah was using Moses to guide them.




Moses and his successor, Joshua (See paragraphs 5, 7)




 6. How did the Israelites respond to Jehovah’s guidance? (Numbers 14:2, 10, 11)

Your answer


6 Sadly, most of the Israelites rejected the clear proof that Jehovah was using Moses as His representative. (Read Numbers 14:2, 10, 11.) Repeatedly, they refused to recognize Moses’ role. As a result, that generation of Israelites was denied entry into the Promised Land.​—Num. 14:30.
 7. Cite examples of those who followed Jehovah’s guidance. (Numbers 14:24) (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 However, some Israelites did follow Jehovah’s guidance. For example, Jehovah noted: “Caleb . . . kept following after me wholeheartedly.” (Read Numbers 14:24.) God rewarded Caleb, even granting him his preferred choice of land in Canaan. (Josh. 14:12-14) The next generation of Israelites also set a good example in following Jehovah’s guidance. When Joshua succeeded Moses as the appointed leader of the Israelites, they “deeply respected him all the days of his life.” (Josh. 4:14) As a result, Jehovah blessed them by bringing them into the land that he had promised.​—Josh. 21:43, 44.
 8. Explain how Jehovah guided his people during the time of the kings. (See also picture.)

Your answer


8 Years later, Jehovah raised up judges to guide his people. Afterward, during the time of the kings, Jehovah appointed prophets to guide his people. Faithful kings heeded the counsel of the prophets. For example, King David humbly accepted correction from the prophet Nathan. (2 Sam. 12:7, 13; 1 Chron. 17:3, 4) King Jehoshaphat relied on the prophet Jahaziel for guidance and encouraged the people of Judah to “put faith in [God’s] prophets.” (2 Chron. 20:14, 15, 20) When in distress, King Hezekiah turned to the prophet Isaiah. (Isa. 37:1-6) Each time the kings followed Jehovah’s guidance, they were blessed and the nation was protected. (2 Chron. 20:29, 30; 32:22) It should have been obvious to all that Jehovah was using his prophets to guide his people. Yet, the majority of the kings as well as the people rejected Jehovah’s prophets.​—Jer. 35:12-15.

HOW JEHOVAH GUIDED THE EARLY CHRISTIANS
 9. Whom did Jehovah use to guide Christians in the first century? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 In the first century C.E., Jehovah formed the Christian congregation. How did he guide those early Christians? He appointed Jesus as head of the congregation. (Eph. 5:23) But Jesus did not personally direct each individual disciple. He used the apostles and the older men in Jerusalem to take the lead. (Acts 15:1, 2) Also, elders were appointed to guide the congregations.​—1 Thess. 5:12; Titus 1:5.




The apostles and the older men in Jerusalem (See paragraph 9)




10. (a) How did most first-century Christians respond to the guidance they received? (Acts 15:30, 31) (b) Why did some in Bible times fail to recognize Jehovah’s representatives? (See the box “Why Some Have Rejected Clear Evidence.”)

Your answers


10 How did first-century Christians respond? The majority were glad to follow the instructions they received. In fact, “they rejoiced over the encouragement” they were given. (Read Acts 15:30, 31.) How, though, has Jehovah been guiding his people in more recent times?
Why Some Have Rejected Clear Evidence
Why have some rejected clear evidence that Jehovah is using human representatives to guide his people? In many cases, it has been because of selfish motives. (John 3:19; 2 Pet. 3:3, 4; Jude 18) For example, some Israelites refused to accept Moses as a divinely appointed guide because they were overly concerned with their own status. (Num. 16:1-3) For similar reasons, many rejected Jesus, despite the miracles he performed. (John 12:37, 43) On the other hand, humble ones with a heartfelt love of truth have seen the powerful evidence that Jehovah is using appointed men to guide his people. (Matt. 16:16, 17) Following that guidance always leads to blessings.


HOW JEHOVAH GUIDES US TODAY
11. Give an example that shows how Jehovah has guided those taking the lead in recent times.

Your answer


11 Jehovah continues to lead his people today. He has been doing so by means of his Word and his Son, the head of the congregation. Can we see evidence that God has also continued to use human representatives? Yes. Consider, for example, certain developments that took place in the late 1800’s. Charles Taze Russell and his associates began to discern that the year 1914 would mark a turning point regarding the establishment of God’s Kingdom. (Dan. 4:25, 26) In reaching that conclusion, they depended on Bible prophecy. Was Jehovah guiding their Bible research? He clearly was. In 1914 world events confirmed that God’s Kingdom had begun to rule. World War I broke out, followed by pestilences, earthquakes, and food shortages. (Luke 21:10, 11) Jehovah was indeed using those sincere Christian men to help his people.
12-13. What arrangements for increased preaching and teaching activity were made during World War II?

Your answer


12 Consider, too, what happened during World War II. After a study of Revelation 17:8, responsible brothers at world headquarters discerned that the war would lead, not to Armageddon, but to a period of relative peace that would open opportunities for increased preaching activity. So even though the move may have seemed impractical at the time, the Watchtower Bible College (School) of Gilead was established by Jehovah’s organization to train missionaries to preach and teach in lands throughout the earth. Missionaries were sent out even during the war. Additionally, the faithful slave arranged for the Course in Theocratic Ministryb to train all in the congregations to become better preachers and teachers. In these ways, God’s people were being prepared for the work ahead.
13 Looking back, we can clearly see that Jehovah was guiding his people during that difficult time. Since World War II, Jehovah’s people in many lands have enjoyed a measure of peace and freedom while carrying out the preaching work. In fact, the work has flourished.
14. Why can we trust direction that comes from Jehovah’s organization and from appointed elders? (Revelation 2:1) (See also picture.)

Your answer


14 Today the members of the Governing Body continue to look to Christ for guidance. They want the instructions they give to the brothers to reflect heaven’s view of matters. In turn, circuit overseers and elders provide direction to the congregations.c Anointed elders are in Christ’s “right hand.” (Read Revelation 2:1.) Of course, these elders are imperfect and make mistakes. Moses and Joshua erred at times, as did the apostles. (Num. 20:12; Josh. 9:14, 15; Rom. 3:23) Still, Christ is carefully guiding the faithful slave and the appointed elders, and he will continue to do so “all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matt. 28:20) We therefore have every reason to trust the guidance that he is providing through those appointed to take the lead.

WE BENEFIT WHEN WE KEEP FOLLOWING JEHOVAH’S GUIDANCE
15-16. What do you learn from the experiences of those who followed Jehovah’s guidance?

Your answer


15 When we keep following Jehovah’s guidance, we enjoy blessings even now. For example, Andy and Robyn heeded the encouragement to keep their life simple. (See study note on Matthew 6:22.) As a result, they were able to volunteer to work on theocratic construction projects. Robyn says: “We have lived in some very small spaces, often with no kitchen. And I had to sell a lot of equipment that I used for photography, a hobby I loved. That brought me to tears. But like Abraham’s wife, Sarah, I was determined to look ahead, not back.” (Heb. 11:15) What did this couple gain from their experience? Robyn says: “We have the deep satisfaction of knowing that we are giving Jehovah everything we have. When working on theocratic assignments, we get a glimpse of how life will be in the new world.” Andy agrees, saying: “We have the satisfaction of being completely spent in support of the Kingdom.”
16 How else do we benefit when we keep following Jehovah’s guidance? After graduating from high school, Marcia took to heart the encouragement to pursue a career in Jehovah’s service. (Matt. 6:33; Rom. 12:11) She says: “I was offered a four-year scholarship at a university. But I wanted to pursue spiritual goals. So I chose to attend a technical training school to learn a trade that would support me in my ministry. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I now enjoy regular pioneering, and my flexible work schedule has allowed me to serve as a commuter at Bethel and to enjoy other special privileges.”
17. What additional blessings result when we keep following Jehovah’s guidance? (Isaiah 48:17, 18)

Your answer


17 At times, we receive counsel that safeguards us from such things as materialism and activities that can put us in danger of breaking God’s laws. Here, too, we are blessed by following the guidance Jehovah provides. We maintain a clean conscience and spare ourselves unnecessary stress. (1 Tim. 6:9, 10) As a result, we can wholeheartedly pursue the worship of Jehovah, which brings the deepest joy, peace, and satisfaction.​—Read Isaiah 48:17, 18.
18. Why are you determined to keep following Jehovah’s guidance?

Your answer


18 No doubt Jehovah will continue to use human representatives to provide guidance during the great tribulation and on into the Thousand Year Reign. (Ps. 45:16) Will we keep following that direction even when doing so requires setting aside our personal preferences? Much may depend on how we respond to the guidance that Jehovah is providing now. Therefore, let us always follow Jehovah’s guidance, including that which is provided by the men who are appointed to watch over us. (Isa. 32:1, 2; Heb. 13:17) And as we do, we have every reason to trust in our Guide, Jehovah, who leads us away from spiritual danger and toward our destination​—everlasting life in the new world.

SONG 48 Daily Walking With Jehovah

a Jehovah also appointed an angel “who was going ahead of the camp,” guiding the nation into the Promised Land. Evidently, that angel was Michael​—Jesus in his prehuman existence.​—Ex. 14:19; 32:34.
b It was later known as the Theocratic Ministry School. Today this training is part of our midweek meeting.
