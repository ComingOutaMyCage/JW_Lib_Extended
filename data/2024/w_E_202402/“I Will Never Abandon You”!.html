<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>YEARS ago, Jehovah’s people wondered, ‘When will the last of the anointed Christians be taken to heaven?’ We once thought that possibly some of the anointed might remain in the earthly Paradise for some time after the war of Armageddon. But in the July 15, 2013, issue of <em>The Watchtower,</em> we learned that all anointed ones who are still on earth will be raised to heaven <strong><em>before</em></strong> the outbreak of Armageddon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:31-40:24:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:31</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:21</a>) Some today may worry that they will feel lost or abandoned when their beloved anointed brothers and sisters are taken to heaven.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Some might wonder if the other sheep will stray from the truth when they no longer have the anointed brothers of the Governing Body to guide them. Perhaps some Scriptural accounts bring such fears to mind. Let us consider two examples. The first involves High Priest Jehoiada. He was an outstanding man of God. He and his wife, Jehoshabeath, protected a young boy named Jehoash and helped him to become a good and faithful <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>king. As long as elderly Jehoiada was alive, Jehoash did well. But after Jehoiada died, Jehoash soon turned bad. He listened to wicked princes and left Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:2-14:24:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 24:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:15-14:24:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 15-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The next example is that of the second-century Christians. The apostle John, the last surviving apostle, was a good influence on many Christians, helping them to endure in their service to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:4-64:1:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">3 John 4</a>) Along with Jesus’ other faithful apostles, John had for some time been fighting hard against the apostasy that was spreading. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:18-62:2:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 2:18</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070157/2:7">study notes on 2 Thess. 2:7</a>.) After John died, though, apostasy spread like wildfire. Within a few decades, the Christian congregation became thoroughly corrupted.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Do those two Scriptural accounts indicate that something similar will happen to Christ’s other sheep when the anointed are taken to heaven? At that time, will faithful Christians on earth stray from their training, as did Jehoash, or drift into apostasy, as did many Christians during the second century C.E.? The answer is <strong><em>absolutely not!</em></strong> We can be sure that when the anointed leave the earthly scene, the other sheep will be well cared for and will thrive spiritually. Why can we be confident?</p>

Because of what we have learned from the Bible about the time period in which we live. This time period differs greatly from the time of ancient Israel and the time of the second-century Christians. So let us look more closely at these three time periods: (1) The time of ancient Israel, (2) the time period after the apostles died, and (3) our times, “the times of restoration of all things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:21-44:3:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 3:21</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:35-5:28:36" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 28:35, 36</a>) Did those words come true? Yes. Over the centuries, many kings chose a wicked course and led God’s people astray. This caused Jehovah to cast off his wicked people and to end the line of earthly kings.

Not at all. Jesus foretold that a great apostasy would take place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 7:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:24-40:13:30" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 13:24-30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:36-40:13:43" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 36-43</a>) The apostles Paul, Peter, and John <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>had all confirmed that Jesus’ prophecy was already beginning to be fulfilled in the first century C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:3-53:2:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:7-53:2:7" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:1" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:18-62:2:18" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 1 John 2:18</a>) In the second century C.E., the Christian congregation became corrupted.

What is our time period called? We might initially refer to it as “the last days” of this wicked system of things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) But the Bible shows that a greater and longer era began at the same time. It will continue until the Messianic Kingdom has restored mankind to perfection and has transformed the earth into a paradise. This era is called “the times of restoration of all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:21-44:3:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 3:21</a>) This period began in 1914. What was then restored? Well, Jesus was enthroned as King in heaven. So Jehovah once again had a ruler to represent Him, an heir of faithful King David. However, that kingship is not all that Jehovah restored. Soon after that, pure worship began to be restored at last!

What happened to God’s people? Without that faithful man, were they left in the lurch? No. As long as they were faithful, Jehovah provided for them. Before Moses died, Jehovah told him to commission Joshua to lead the people. Moses had been training Joshua for decades. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:11-2:33:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex. 33:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:9-5:34:9" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Deut. 34:9</a>) In addition, there were many other capable men taking the lead​—chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and even tens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:15-5:1:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deut. 1:15</a>) God’s people were well cared for. We find a similar example in Elijah. He had been taking the lead in pure worship among the Israelites for decades. But the time came when Jehovah transferred him to a different assignment, down south in Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:2:1-12:2:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Ki. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:12-14:21:12" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 21:12</a>) Were faithful people in the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel abandoned?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:2:7-12:2:7" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Ki. 2:7</a>) Thus, many faithful men were available to help lead God’s people.

For decades the brothers of the Governing Body have been training men from among the other sheep to take the lead. For example, they have organized many schools to train elders, traveling overseers, Branch Committee members, overseers at Bethel, and others. The Governing Body has personally been training helpers to the various committees of the Governing Body. These helpers are right now faithfully carrying a heavy load of responsibility. They are well-prepared to continue the work of caring for Christ’s sheep.</p>

It reveals that the political elements of this world will “battle with the Lamb.” They will lose, of course. We read: “The Lamb will conquer them.” And who will help him? The verse answers. Those who are “called,” “chosen,” and “faithful.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:14-66:17:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 17:14</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Who are these? The resurrected anointed ones! So when the last of the anointed on earth are taken to heaven near the end of the great tribulation, one of their first assignments will be to fight. What a remarkable assignment! Some anointed Christians were fighters before they became Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some even served in the armed forces of this world. But later they became true Christians and learned the way of peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:16-53:3:16" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 3:16</a>) They put aside all physical warfare. However, after being raised to heaven, they will serve along with Christ and his holy angels, waging the final war against God’s enemies.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[62]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Think of it! On earth, some anointed Christians are elderly, even frail. But once resurrected to life in heaven, they will be mighty and immortal spirit creatures, assigned to fight alongside their Warrior-King, Jesus Christ. After the war of Armageddon has been fought, they will share in guiding mankind to perfection. Without a doubt, they will then do their beloved brothers and sisters on earth a lot more good in heaven than they ever could as mere imperfect humans!</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[64]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Are you of the other sheep? Then what will <strong><em>you</em></strong> need to do when the climactic war of Armageddon begins? Simply this: Trust in Jehovah, and follow his direction. What might that include? The Bible comfortingly says: “Enter your inner rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:20-23:26:20" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 26:20</a>) All of God’s faithful servants, in heaven and on earth, will be safe during that time. Like the apostle Paul, we are convinced that neither “governments nor things now here nor things <strong><em>to come</em></strong> . . . will be able to separate us from God’s love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rom. 8:38, 39</a>) Always remember: Jehovah loves you, and he will <strong><em>never</em></strong> abandon you!</p>
