Lessons We Can Learn From the Nazirites


“He is holy to Jehovah all the days of his Naziriteship.”​—NUM. 6:8.


FOCUS
How the example of the Nazirites can help us to serve Jehovah with a spirit of self-sacrifice and courage.


 1. What fine attitude have worshippers of Jehovah shown throughout history?

Your answer


DO YOU treasure your relationship with Jehovah? No doubt you do! And you are not alone. Since ancient times, untold multitudes have felt the same way as you do. (Ps. 104:33, 34) Many have made sacrifices to worship Jehovah. That was certainly the case with those in ancient Israel known as Nazirites. Who were they, and what can we learn from their example?
 2. (a) Who were the Nazirites? (Numbers 6:1, 2) (b) Why did some Israelites choose to take a Nazirite vow?

Your answers


2 The word “Nazirite” comes from the Hebrew term that means “One Singled Out,” “Separated One,” or “Dedicated One.” This term aptly describes the zealous Israelites who made certain personal sacrifices to serve Jehovah in a special way. The Mosaic Law allowed for a man or a woman to make a special vow to Jehovah by choosing to live as a Nazirite for a period of time.a (Read Numbers 6:1, 2.) That vow, or solemn promise, involved following guidelines that the rest of the Israelites did not have to observe. Why, then, would an Israelite choose to take the Nazirite vow? Such an Israelite was likely motivated by deep love for Jehovah and sincere gratitude for His rich blessing.​—Deut. 6:5; 16:17.
Nazirites Appointed by Jehovah
Jehovah appointed some Israelites as Nazirites for life. These Nazirites took no vows, and there was no time limit set for their service as Nazirites. Only three divinely appointed Nazirites are mentioned in the Bible:
  Samson (Judg. 13:2-5, 24, 25)

  Samuel (1 Sam. 1:10, 11, 20, 27, 28)

  John the Baptizer (Luke 1:13-15)


However, this study article discusses the volunteer Nazirites who are considered at Numbers 6:2-7.


 3. How are God’s people today similar to the Nazirites?

Your answer


3 The Nazirite arrangement ended when the Mosaic Law was replaced by “the law of the Christ.” (Gal. 6:2; Rom. 10:4) However, like the Nazirites, Jehovah’s people today continue to show an intense desire to serve him with their whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. (Mark 12:30) We willingly make a vow to do so when we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah. Living up to that vow involves submitting to Jehovah’s will and making sacrifices. As we examine how the Nazirites lived up to their vow, we can learn valuable lessons about how we can live up to ours.b (Matt. 16:24) Let us consider some examples.
BE SELF-SACRIFICING
 4. According to Numbers 6:3, 4, how was a Nazirite’s self-sacrificing spirit tested?

Your answer


4 Read Numbers 6:3, 4. Nazirites had to avoid all alcohol and products of the grapevine, such as grapes and raisins. People around them would have regularly enjoyed such foods and rightly so, since there was nothing wrong with these items. The Bible describes “wine that makes man’s heart rejoice” as a gift from God. (Ps. 104:14, 15) Yet, the Nazirites willingly sacrificed their right to enjoy such things.c




Are you willing to make sacrifices, as the Nazirites were? (See paragraphs 4-6)




 5. What personal sacrifices did Madián and Marcela choose to make, and why?

Your answer


5 Like the Nazirites, we too make sacrifices to worship Jehovah more fully. Consider the example of Madián and Marcela.d This Christian couple enjoyed a comfortable life. Madián had a good job that allowed them to live in a beautiful apartment. However, they wanted to do more in their service to Jehovah. To achieve that goal, they decided to make some adjustments. “We started reducing our expenses,” they say. “We moved to a smaller apartment and sold our car.” Madián and Marcela did not have to make these sacrifices​—they chose to make them because doing so allowed them to expand their ministry. They feel satisfied and happy about their decisions.
 6. Why do Christians today make sacrifices? (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Christians today find joy in making personal sacrifices in order to dedicate more time to theocratic activities. (1 Cor. 9:3-6) Jehovah does not require us to make these sacrifices; nor are the things given up wrong in themselves. For example, some forgo a preferred job, a home, or even a pet. Many have decided to postpone getting married or starting a family. Others have chosen to serve where the need is greater, even though that means living far away from loved ones. Many of us willingly make such sacrifices because we want to give Jehovah our best. Be assured that Jehovah greatly values any sacrifice, large or small, that you choose to make in order to serve him.​—Heb. 6:10.
BE WILLING TO STAND OUT AS DIFFERENT
 7. What challenge might a Nazirite have faced in sticking to his vow? (Numbers 6:5) (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 Read Numbers 6:5. Nazirites vowed not to cut their hair. That was a way to show their complete submission to Jehovah. Depending on the length of his Naziriteship, an Israelite’s uncut hair may have become noticeable to others. If those around him supported his desire to stick to his Nazirite vow, this may not have posed a challenge. Sadly, however, there were times in Israel’s history when Nazirites were not appreciated or supported. During the time of the prophet Amos, apostate Israelites “kept giving the Nazirites wine to drink,” likely in an attempt to cause them to violate their vow to abstain from wine. (Amos 2:12) At times, it must have taken real courage for a Nazirite to stick to his vow and stand out as different.




A Nazirite who stuck to his vow was willing to stand out as different (See paragraph 7)




 8. What do you find encouraging about young Benjamin’s experience?

Your answer


8 With Jehovah’s help, we too can courageously stand out as different, even if we are shy, or timid, by nature. Consider the example of Benjamin, a ten-year-old Witness in Norway. His school held an event in support of war-torn Ukraine. The children were asked to sing a song while dressed in Ukraine’s national colors. Benjamin planned to avoid this nationalistic event by remaining a discreet distance away from where it would take place. However, a teacher saw him and loudly called out: “You must come and join us now. We are all waiting for you!” Benjamin courageously approached the teacher and said: “I am neutral, and I do not join in political demonstrations. In fact, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses are in prison because they refuse to go to war.” The teacher accepted this explanation and excused Benjamin from the event. However, his classmates began to ask why he did not join them. Benjamin was so nervous that he almost started to cry; yet, he bravely repeated to the whole class what he had said to the teacher. Afterward, Benjamin told his parents that he felt that Jehovah had helped him to stand up for his faith.
 9. In what way can we make Jehovah’s heart rejoice?

Your answer


9 Because we choose to submit to Jehovah’s will, we stand out as different from the people around us. We need courage to identify ourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses at work or at school. And as this world’s attitudes and conduct go from bad to worse, we will likely find it more difficult to live according to Bible principles and share the good news with others. (2 Tim. 1:8; 3:13) Always remember, though, that we “make [Jehovah’s] heart rejoice” when we courageously stand out as different from those who do not serve him.​—Prov. 27:11; Mal. 3:18.
KEEP JEHOVAH FIRST IN YOUR LIFE
10. How might following the requirement mentioned at Numbers 6:6, 7 have been a test for Nazirites?

Your answer


10 Read Numbers 6:6, 7. Nazirites could not go near a dead body. At first glance, this might not seem like a big sacrifice. In Bible times, though, a Nazirite would have found this requirement to be a real challenge when a close relative died. Funeral customs of the day involved being near the body of the deceased. (John 19:39, 40; Acts 9:36-40) A Nazirite’s vow would very much limit his ability to follow such customs. Even when dealing with family situations during times of great grief, Nazirites showed strong faith by sticking to their vow. Jehovah surely strengthened these devoted worshippers of his to deal with the challenges that they had to face.
11. What must a Christian be determined to do when dealing with family matters? (See also picture.)

Your answer


11 As Christians, we take our dedication vow to Jehovah seriously. This affects our decisions and actions regarding family matters. We diligently care for our Scriptural family responsibilities, but we never put the desires of our family members ahead of what Jehovah requires of us. (Matt. 10:35-37; 1 Tim. 5:8) Sometimes, that may mean sacrificing a measure of peace with relatives in order to please Jehovah.




Are you willing to put Jehovah’s will first even in the most difficult of circumstances? (See paragraph 11)e




12. As he cared for a difficult family situation, what did Alexandru do and what did he not do?

Your answer


12 Consider the experience of Alexandru and his wife, Dorina. After the couple studied the Bible for a year, Dorina decided to stop, and she wanted Alexandru to stop too. However, he calmly and tactfully told her that he would continue. Dorina was not pleased and tried to force him to stop studying. Alexandru says that he tried to understand her reaction, but it was not easy for him. At times, when Dorina criticized him and replied harshly, he felt like giving up the Bible study. Still, Alexandru persevered in putting Jehovah first, all the while showing great love and respect for his wife. In the end, his fine example motivated her to resume her Bible study, and she eventually embraced the truth.​—See on jw.org the video Alexandru and Dorina Văcar: “Love Is Patient and Kind” in the series “Truth Transforms Lives.”
13. How can we show love for Jehovah and for our family?

Your answer


13 Jehovah created the family arrangement, and he wants us to have a happy family. (Eph. 3:14, 15) If we want to be truly happy, we need to do things Jehovah’s way. Never doubt that Jehovah cherishes your self-sacrificing efforts to worship him as you care for your family and treat them with love and respect.​—Rom. 12:10.
ENCOURAGE A NAZIRITE-LIKE SPIRIT
14. Whom especially should we strive to encourage with our words?

Your answer


14 All who choose to worship Jehovah today need to be willing to make sacrifices motivated by love. At times, doing so is not easy. How can we help one another to show such an attitude? By being encouraging with our words. (Job 16:5) Are there some in your congregation who are trying to simplify their life in order to have a greater share in theocratic activities? Do you know young ones who are bravely standing out as different from others in school, even though it is difficult for them to do so? What about Bible students and fellow believers who may be struggling to remain faithful because of family opposition? Let us seize every opportunity to speak reassuringly to such dear fellow worshippers, expressing our appreciation for their self-sacrificing spirit and courage.​—Philem. 4, 5, 7.
15. How have some supported those who are in full-time service?

Your answer


15 Sometimes, we may be able to offer practical help to fellow Christians who are in full-time service. (Prov. 19:17; Heb. 13:16) This was the sincere desire of a faithful elderly sister who lives in Sri Lanka. She received an increase in her pension and wanted to help two young pioneer sisters to continue in their ministry despite economic difficulties. So she decided to contribute a specific amount each month toward their telephone expenses. What a beautiful spirit that sister shows!
16. What can we learn from the Nazirite arrangement of old?

Your answer


16 We can certainly learn much from the fine example set by the volunteer Nazirites of old! However, this arrangement also reveals something about our heavenly Father, Jehovah. He is confident that we sincerely desire to please him and that we are willing to make sacrifices to live up to our dedication vow. He dignifies us by letting us express our love for him in a personal way. (Prov. 23:15, 16; Mark 10:28-30; 1 John 4:19) The Nazirite arrangement shows that Jehovah notices and treasures the sacrifices we make to serve him. May we, then, be determined to continue serving Jehovah, willingly offering him our very best.

SONG 124 Ever Loyal

a Although a few Nazirites were divinely appointed, most were likely Israelites who volunteered to serve in that capacity.​—See the box “Nazirites Appointed by Jehovah.”
b At times, our publications have compared the Nazirites with those in full-time service. However, in this article, we will focus on how all dedicated servants of Jehovah can show a Nazirite-like spirit.
c In general, it does not seem that a Nazirite had any additional obligations, such as a work assignment, to carry out in order to fulfill his vow.
d See on jw.org the article “We Decided to Simplify Our Lives” in the series “Experiences of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

e PICTURE DESCRIPTION: From a rooftop, a Nazirite watches the funeral procession of a beloved family member. His vow prevents him from taking part at close range.
