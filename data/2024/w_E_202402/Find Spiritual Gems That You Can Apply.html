<p id="p3" data-pid="3">When we read the Bible, we can look for spiritual gems by researching relevant facts. But how can we benefit more fully?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong><em>Dig deeper</em></strong> into the details of Bible accounts. For example, determine who wrote the passage, to whom, and when. What were the circumstances, what occurred before, and what happened afterward?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong><em>Discern the lessons</em></strong> by researching such questions as: ‘How did the people who were involved feel? What qualities did they display? Why should I either imitate those qualities or avoid developing them?’</p>
