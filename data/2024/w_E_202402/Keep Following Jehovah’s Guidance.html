For example, Andy and Robyn heeded the encouragement to keep their life simple. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/6:22">study note on Matthew 6:22</a>.) As a result, they were able to volunteer to work on theocratic construction projects. Robyn says: “We have lived in some very small spaces, often with no kitchen. And I had to sell a lot of equipment that I used for photography, a hobby I loved. That brought me to tears. But like Abraham’s wife, Sarah, I was determined to look ahead, not back.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:15-58:11:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 11:15</a>) What did this couple gain from their experience? Robyn says: “We have the deep satisfaction of knowing that we are giving Jehovah everything we have. When working on theocratic assignments, we get a glimpse of how life will be in the new world.” Andy agrees, saying: “We have the satisfaction of being completely spent in support of the Kingdom.”</p>

After graduating from high school, Marcia took to heart the encouragement to pursue a career in Jehovah’s service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:11</a>) She says: “I was offered a four-year scholarship at a university. But I wanted to pursue spiritual goals. So I chose to attend a technical training school to learn a trade that would support me in my ministry. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I now enjoy regular pioneering, and my flexible work schedule has allowed me to serve as a commuter at Bethel and to enjoy other special privileges.”</p>
