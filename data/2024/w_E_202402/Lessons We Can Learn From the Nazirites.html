The Mosaic Law allowed for a man or a woman to make a special vow to Jehovah by choosing to live as a Nazirite for a period of time.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:6:1-4:6:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Numbers 6:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> That vow, or solemn promise, involved following guidelines that the rest of the Israelites did not have to observe. Why, then, would an Israelite choose to take the Nazirite vow?

For example, some forgo a preferred job, a home, or even a pet. Many have decided to postpone getting married or starting a family. Others have chosen to serve where the need is greater, even though that means living far away from loved ones. Many of us willingly make such sacrifices because we want to give Jehovah our best.

That was a way to show their complete submission to Jehovah. Depending on the length of his Naziriteship, an Israelite’s uncut hair may have become noticeable to others. If those around him supported his desire to stick to his Nazirite vow, this may not have posed a challenge. Sadly, however, there were times in Israel’s history when Nazirites were not appreciated or supported. During the time of the prophet Amos, apostate Israelites “kept giving the Nazirites wine to drink,” likely in an attempt to cause them to violate their vow to abstain from wine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:2:12-30:2:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Amos 2:12</a>) At times, it must have taken real courage for a Nazirite to stick to his vow and stand out as different.</p>

Consider the example of Benjamin, a ten-year-old Witness in Norway. His school held an event in support of war-torn Ukraine. The children were asked to sing a song while dressed in Ukraine’s national colors. Benjamin planned to avoid this nationalistic event by remaining a discreet distance away from where it would take place. However, a teacher saw him and <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>loudly called out: “You must come and join us now. We are all waiting for you!” Benjamin courageously approached the teacher and said: “I am neutral, and I do not join in political demonstrations. In fact, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses are in prison because they refuse to go to war.” The teacher accepted this explanation and excused Benjamin from the event. However, his classmates began to ask why he did not join them. Benjamin was so nervous that he almost started to cry; yet, he bravely repeated to the whole class what he had said to the teacher. Afterward, Benjamin told his parents that he felt that Jehovah had helped him to stand up for his faith.</p>

At times, doing so is not easy. How can we help one another <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>to show such an attitude? By being encouraging with our words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:16:5-18:16:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 16:5</a>) Are there some in your congregation who are trying to simplify their life in order to have a greater share in theocratic activities? Do you know young ones who are bravely standing out as different from others in school, even though it is difficult for them to do so? What about Bible students and fellow believers who may be struggling to remain faithful because of family opposition? Let us seize every opportunity to speak reassuringly to such dear fellow worshippers, expressing our appreciation for their self-sacrificing spirit and courage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:4-57:1:5" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Philem. 4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:7-57:1:7" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>

However, this arrangement also reveals something about our heavenly Father, Jehovah. He is confident that we sincerely desire to please him and that we are willing to make sacrifices to live up to our dedication vow. He dignifies us by letting us express our love for him in a personal way.

May we, then, be determined to continue serving Jehovah, willingly offering him our very best.</p>
