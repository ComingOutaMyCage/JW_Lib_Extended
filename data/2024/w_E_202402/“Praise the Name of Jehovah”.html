No. Consider an illustration. A little girl affectionately throws her arms around her father’s neck and says, “You’re the best daddy in the whole world!” The father is pleased, even touched, by her spontaneous act. Why? Should we assume that he is an insecure man who craves, even depends on, praise from his child? No. Rather, we trust that he is a strong father who is delighted to see his daughter showing love and appreciation. He knows that such qualities will contribute to her happiness as she grows up. For similar reasons, Jehovah, the greatest Father, is pleased when we praise him.</p>

Jehovah’s name involves his reputation, so it brings to mind all his beautiful qualities and his marvelous deeds. David wanted to treat his Father’s name as holy and to praise it. <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>He wanted to do so with “everything within” him​—that is, wholeheartedly.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:5-2:34:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 34:5-7</a>) Jesus made that truth clearer than ever when he related the parable of the wayward son and his father.

Consider the time when he cured a demonized man in the region of the <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>Gerasenes.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[65]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> At the outset, we may simply teach people that God’s name is Jehovah. That in itself can have a lasting impact on an honesthearted person. For example, a young woman named Aaliyah<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> was raised in a non-Christian household. But she felt no real connection to her religion or to God. That changed after she began to study with the Witnesses. She started to see God as her Friend. And she was amazed to learn that God’s name has been removed from many Bibles and replaced with mere titles, such as Lord. Learning Jehovah’s name was a turning point in her life. She exclaimed: “My best Friend has a name!” The result? She says: “I have so much peace in my heart now. I feel very honored.” A man named Steve was a musician who came from a conservative Jewish background. He distanced himself from organized religion because he had seen so much hypocrisy. However, during a time of grief, he agreed to sit in on a Bible study conducted by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He was deeply touched to learn God’s name. He says: “I had never learned God’s name.” He adds: “For the first time, I understood that God is real! I saw him as a Person. I knew then that I had found a Friend.”</p>

Do you help them to see what our God is really like? In doing so, you praise God’s name. May you keep on praising Jehovah’s holy name by helping people to know the Person behind that name. In that way, you will save lives. You will follow the lead of your King, Christ Jesus. And above all, you will please your loving Father, Jehovah. May you “praise [his] name forever and ever”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:2-19:145:2" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 145:2</a>.</p>
