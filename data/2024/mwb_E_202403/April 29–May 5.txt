TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. “Praise Jehovah at All Times”


(10 min.)

David praised Jehovah even when he was experiencing trials (Ps 34:1; w07 3/1 22 ¶11)
David boasted in Jehovah, not himself (Ps 34:2-4; w07 3/1 22 ¶13)
David’s expressions of praise strengthened his companions (Ps 34:5; w07 3/1 23 ¶15)







After he was delivered from Abimelech, David was joined in the wilderness by 400 men who had grievances with Saul. (1Sa 22:1, 2) David may have had such ones in mind when he composed this psalm.​—Ps 34, superscription.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I praise Jehovah when speaking with someone at the next congregation meeting?’

7. Three Ways to Praise Jehovah at Meetings


(15 min.) Discussion.








Congregation meetings provide excellent opportunities to praise Jehovah. Here are three ways.
Conversations: Talk about Jehovah’s goodness when conversing with others. (Ps 145:1, 7) Did you hear or read a specific point that benefited you? Did you have a good field service experience? Did you receive encouragement from someone by their words or actions? Did you observe an aspect of creation that impressed you? These are all gifts from Jehovah. (Jas 1:17) Arrive a few minutes early so that you will have time to talk with others.
Comments: Try to give at least one comment during each meeting. (Ps 26:12) You could give a direct answer to the question or a comment on a secondary point, a scripture, the artwork, or the application. Since others will likely raise their hand when you do, prepare several comments. More will be able to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise” if our comments are 30 seconds or less.​—Heb 13:15.
Songs: Sing the Kingdom songs enthusiastically. (Ps 147:1) You may not get called on to comment at every meeting, especially in a large congregation, but you can always join in singing the songs. Even if you feel that you are not a good singer, when you do your best, how it must please Jehovah! (2Co 8:12) You can prepare by practicing the songs at home.
