Jehovah is like a crag, a stronghold, and a shield (Ps 18:1, 2; w09 5/1 14 ¶4-5)
Jehovah hears our cries for help (Ps 18:6; it-2 1161 ¶7)
Jehovah acts in our behalf (Ps 18:16, 17; w22.04 3 ¶1)







Jehovah might choose to remove a trial as he occasionally did for David. However, often God makes “the way out” by providing what we need so that we can endure the trial successfully.​—1Co 10:13.
