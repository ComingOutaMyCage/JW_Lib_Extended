7. Teenagers Who Maintain Moral Integrity


(15 min.) Discussion.








Christian youths must fight to maintain moral integrity. They struggle against their imperfect flesh and fight to remain clean during the bloom of youth​—a time when strong sexual feelings can distort a young person’s judgment. (Ro 7:21; 1Co 7:36) They must also resist relentless pressure from others to engage in sex​—heterosexual and homosexual. (Eph 2:2) We are proud of those who continue to maintain their integrity.
