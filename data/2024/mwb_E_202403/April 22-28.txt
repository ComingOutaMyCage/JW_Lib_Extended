TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. Why Confess a Serious Sin?


(10 min.)

David experienced distress when trying to conceal his sins, perhaps involving Bath-sheba (Ps 32:3, 4; w93 3/15 9 ¶7)
David confessed to Jehovah and was pardoned (Ps 32:5; cl 262 ¶8)
David felt relief after receiving Jehovah’s forgiveness (Ps 32:1; w01 6/1 30 ¶1)







If we commit a serious sin, we should confess by humbly admitting our wrongdoing to Jehovah and asking for his forgiveness. We should also seek help from the elders, who will help us to regain our spiritual health. (Jas 5:14-16) The result is refreshment from Jehovah.​—Ac 3:19.
