TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. “Jehovah, My Source of Goodness”


(10 min.)

Friendships with those who serve Jehovah bring us delight (Ps 16:2, 3; w18.12 26 ¶11)
An approved relationship with Jehovah gives us contentment (Ps 16:5, 6; w14 2/15 29 ¶4)
Jehovah’s spiritual protection makes us feel secure (Ps 16:8, 9; w08 2/15 3 ¶2-3)







Like David, we enjoy a rich life because it centers on the worship of Jehovah, our Source of goodness.
ASK YOURSELF, ‘How is my life better than before I came into the truth?’

  Have an enthusiastic share in the campaign to invite people to the special talk and the Memorial. Make a list of acquaintances, and invite them. If any live outside your territory, consult jw.org to find the time and location of the meetings in their area

  During March and April, increase your activity in the ministry. Can you auxiliary pioneer with the goal of either 15 or 30 hours?

  On March 18, begin considering the important events that occurred during the final week of Jesus’ life on earth. You can determine how much material to read each day from the “2024 Memorial Bible Reading Schedule” on pages 6-7

  On the day of the Memorial, watch the special Morning Worship program on jw.org

  At the Memorial, warmly welcome newcomers and inactive ones. Make yourself available to answer questions afterward. Arrange to call on attenders to further their interest
