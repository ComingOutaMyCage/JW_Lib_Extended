8. Keep Offering Bible Studies!


(10 min.) Discussion.
















Have you started a Bible study using the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure during this month’s special campaign? If so, you must be excited! Likely, others are also encouraged by your results. On the other hand, if you have not yet started a Bible study, you may be wondering if your efforts are really worthwhile. What can you do if you feel discouraged about your results?
Play the VIDEO DRAMATIZATION “We Recommend Ourselves as God’s Ministers . . . by Patience”​—When Preaching. Then ask the audience:
  How can 2 Corinthians 6:4, 6 help us if ever our ministry seems like a “black hole”?

Your answer



  What adjustments could you make if you feel as though your efforts to start a Bible study have been unproductive?

Your answer




Remember, our joy does not depend on how many Bible studies we start or conduct. Rather, joy is the result of knowing that Jehovah is pleased with our efforts. (Lu 10:17-20) So continue to participate in this special campaign wholeheartedly, knowing that “your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord”!​—1Co 15:58.
