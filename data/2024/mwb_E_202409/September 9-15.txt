1. Appreciate the Privileges That You Have

We value our privileges of service (Ps 84:1-3; wp16.6 8 ¶2-3)
Enjoy the assignments that you have instead of focusing on those that you wish you had (Ps 84:10; w08 7/15 30 ¶3-4)

Each assignment has its blessings and its challenges. If you focus on the blessings, you can find joy in any assignment.
