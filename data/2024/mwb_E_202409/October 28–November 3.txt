Jehovah’s compassion moves him to be reasonable (Ps 103:8; w23.07 21 ¶5)
He does not give up on us when we make mistakes (Ps 103:9, 10; w23.09 6-7 ¶16-18)
He does not expect more of us than we can give (Ps 103:14; w23.05 26 ¶2)

Giving Jehovah our best makes him happy, and it brings us joy as well. (Ps 73:28) However, trying to do our best without considering our limitations can cause needless anxiety and disappointment.

Your answer





HOW CAN WE DETERMINE OUR LIMITATIONS?
  Avoid the tendency to compare. (Ga 6:4) Do not let what others do dictate what you do or think you can do. You may be able to do more or less than a person of a similar age or in a similar family situation

  Do not let your comfort zone define your limits. (Ro 12:1; 1Co 7:31) Do not be afraid to try a form of service that, at first, may seem beyond your reach or that you think you would not enjoy.​—Mal 3:10

  Test your limits by setting short-term goals. For example, is regular pioneering within your reach? For a few months, why not try increasing the time you spend in the ministry or try auxiliary pioneering? Could you try regular pioneering for one year? Even if you conclude that you cannot become a regular pioneer or do so for more than a year, you will never regret the smaller goals that you were able to achieve.​—Ec 6:9

  Be willing to adapt. Our circumstances change, and so do our limitations. So, reassess your goals regularly
