8. “They Will Sanctify My Name”


(15 min.) Discussion.

Satan began slandering Jehovah’s name in the garden of Eden. Since then, the vindication of Jehovah’s name has been the most important issue facing all intelligent creation.
Consider just a few of the vicious lies that Satan has promoted about Jehovah. He accuses Him of being a harsh and unloving ruler. (Ge 3:1-6; Job 4:18, 19) He claims that Jehovah’s worshippers do not really love Him. (Job 2:4, 5) He has even caused millions to believe that Jehovah is not the Creator of the beautiful natural world around us.​—Ro 1:20, 21.
How do those lies make you feel? Likely, they make you want to stand up and defend Jehovah! He knew that his people would want to help sanctify his name. (Compare Isaiah 29:23.) How can you help?
  Help others come to know and love Jehovah. (Joh 17:25, 26) Be ready to offer evidence that he exists and to teach others about his marvelous qualities.​—Isa 63:7

  Love Jehovah with your whole heart. (Mt 22:37, 38) Obey Jehovah’s commands not only because they are good for you but because you want to make Jehovah happy.​—Pr 27:11
