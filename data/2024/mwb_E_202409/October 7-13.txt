7. When Anxieties Overwhelm Young Ones


(15 min.) Discussion.








Those who serve Jehovah are not immune to anxiety. For example, David experienced anxiety at various times in his life, and so do many of our brothers today. (Ps 13:2; 139:23) Unfortunately, even young ones are affected. At times, anxiety may make routine activities, such as going to school or attending congregation meetings, seem overwhelming. It may even lead to panic attacks or suicidal thoughts.
Young ones, if ever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety, reach out to a parent or a mature adult. Make sure that you also turn to Jehovah for support. (Php 4:6) He will help you. (Ps 94:17-19; Isa 41:10) Consider Steing’s example.
Play the VIDEO Jehovah Cared for Me. Then ask the audience:
• What Bible verse helped Steing, and why?

• How did Jehovah care for him?

Your answer









Parents, you can help your children to deal with anxiety by patiently listening to them, by expressing your love for them, and by helping them to build confidence in Jehovah’s love. (Tit 2:4; Jas 1:19) Rely on Jehovah to provide you with the comfort and strength that you need to support your children.
We may not know when someone in the congregation is dealing with severe anxiety or understand how he feels. Still, we can help by making all in the congregation feel loved and accepted.​—Pr 12:25; Heb 10:24.
