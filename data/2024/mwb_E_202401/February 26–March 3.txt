8. “Wisdom Is Better Than Weapons of War”


(10 min.) Discussion.








Acts of violence are increasing throughout the world. Jehovah knows that the violence we see and experience can cause us much anxiety. He also understands our need for protection. One way that he protects us is through his Word, the Bible.​—Ps 12:5-7.
The Bible contains wisdom that is “better than weapons of war.” (Ec 9:18) Consider how the following Bible principles can help protect us from becoming victims of violence.
  Ec 4:9, 10​—Avoid being alone in unsafe areas and situations

  Pr 22:3​—Remain aware of your surroundings when in public

  Pr 26:17​—Do not get involved in arguments that do not concern you

  Pr 17:14​—Leave the area if violence seems imminent. And stay away from crowds that assemble to protest

  Lu 12:15​—Never risk your life to protect your possessions


Play the VIDEO Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless​—Enoch, Not Lamech. Then ask the audience:
How did Enoch’s example affect the father’s decisions and conduct in the face of violence?​—Heb 11:5

Your answer



In some situations, a Christian may feel the need to take reasonable measures to defend himself or his property. If so, he would do everything in his power to avoid taking a human life and becoming bloodguilty.​—Ps 51:14; see “Questions From Readers” in the July 2017 issue of The Watchtower.
