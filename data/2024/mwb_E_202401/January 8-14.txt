TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. When Life Seems Unfair


(10 min.)

Remember that Jehovah is never the Source of injustice (Job 34:10; wp19.1 8 ¶2)
The wicked may seem to get away with their unjust actions; however, they cannot hide from Jehovah (Job 34:21-26; w17.04 10 ¶5)
The best way to help victims of injustice is to teach them about Jehovah (Job 35:9, 10; Mt 28:19, 20; w21.05 7 ¶19-20)

7. Are You Motivated to “Preach the Word” Informally?


(15 min.) Discussion.








Paul urged Timothy: “Preach the word; be at it urgently.” (2Ti 4:2) The Greek verb translated “be at it urgently” was sometimes used in a military setting to refer to a soldier or a guard at his post who was always ready for action. The expression well describes our desire to be always alert for opportunities to turn an ordinary conversation into a witness.
Our love for Jehovah and appreciation for all that he does for us move us to tell others about his beautiful qualities.
Read Psalm 71:8. Then ask the audience:
What good things about Jehovah do you like to tell others about?
