7. Help Others to Feel Jehovah’s Love


(15 min.) Discussion.








We are glad to worship a God who is the very essence of love. (1Jo 4:8, 16) Jehovah’s loving personality draws us to him and motivates us to stay close to him. As Jehovah’s sheep, we all feel loved by Jehovah.
We do our best to reflect Jehovah’s love by how we treat our family members, fellow worshippers, and others. (Job 6:14; 1Jo 4:11) By showing love, we help others come to know Jehovah and draw close to him. In contrast, if we fail to show love to others, they may find it difficult to sense Jehovah’s love.
Play the VIDEO We Found Christian Love in Jehovah’s Family. Then ask the audience:
What did you learn from Lei Lei and Mimi’s experience about the importance of showing love?
