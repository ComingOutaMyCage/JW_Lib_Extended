7. Be Prepared for Situations That Require Medical or Surgical Care


(15 min.) Discussion. To be handled by an elder.

Jehovah’s organization has provided tools to help us obey God’s law regarding blood. (Ac 15:28, 29) Are you making good use of them?
Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Card and Identity Card (ic): These cards outline a patient’s wishes concerning the medical use of blood. Baptized publishers can obtain from the literature servant a DPA card for themselves as well as an Identity Card for their minor children. These cards should be kept on our person at all times. If you need to fill one out or update one, do not procrastinate.
Information for Expectant Mothers (S-401) and Information for Patients Requiring Surgery or Chemotherapy (S-407): These documents help us be better prepared for our medical care, including matters involving the blood issue. Ask your elders for a copy of the appropriate document if you are pregnant or in need of surgery or cancer treatment.
Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC): HLC members are qualified elders who are prepared to provide information to doctors and publishers on matters concerning blood. They can discuss with your health-care provider medical treatment strategies for avoiding blood transfusions. If needed, they can help you find a cooperative doctor. They are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Contact the HLC as soon as possible in any situation that requires a hospital stay, a surgery, or a therapy​—such as cancer treatment—​even if it seems that the situation might not involve the blood issue. This also applies to expectant mothers. If assistance is needed, request from an elder the contact information for the HLC.
Play the VIDEO Hospital Liaison Committees​—How Do They Assist? Then ask the audience:
How can the HLC help you if you face a situation that may require medical or surgical care?

Your answer



ARE YOU PREPARED?
When facing a medical situation that may involve the blood issue,


Contact the HLC as soon as possible.



Be prepared to inform your doctor of your stand on blood transfusions, the use of blood fractions, and procedures involving the use of your own blood.​—See km 11/06 3.



Put your decisions in writing on your DPA card.



Inform your health-care agents of your decisions.



Have ready access to the contact information of a local elder.
