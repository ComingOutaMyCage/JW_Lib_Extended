TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. “I Will Praise You, O Jehovah”!


(10 min.)

Jehovah is extraordinarily good to us (Ps 8:3-6; w21.08 3 ¶6)
We gladly praise Jehovah by telling others about his wonderful works (Ps 9:1; w20.05 23 ¶10)
We also praise him when we sing wholeheartedly to him (Ps 9:2; w22.04 7 ¶13)







ASK YOURSELF, ‘In what other ways can I praise Jehovah?’

7. How to Witness Informally in a Natural Manner


(10 min.) Discussion.
One way that we can increase our expressions of praise to Jehovah is by witnessing to those whom we meet during our daily activities. (Ps 35:28) At first, we may feel nervous about giving a witness informally. However, when we learn how to start and continue conversations in a natural manner, we can become effective at it and even enjoy it!








Play the VIDEO Be Ready to Share “the Good News of Peace”​—Take the Initiative. Then ask the audience:
What did you learn from this dramatization that can help you to become more effective at informal witnessing?

Your answer



The following are a few tips that can help you get started:
  Be alert to opportunities to start conversations each time you leave your home. Pray about it, and ask Jehovah to direct you to honesthearted people

  Be friendly and show personal interest in the people you meet. Try to learn something about the person that could help you to know what Bible truths might appeal to him

  Look for an opportunity to exchange contact information, if appropriate

  Do not be disappointed if a conversation ends before you can give a witness

  Think about the person after your conversation. Continue to show personal interest by sending him a link to a Bible verse or to an article on jw.org



Try this: If someone asks you, ‘How was your weekend?,’ tell him about something you learned at the meeting or about the work you do as a Bible teacher.
