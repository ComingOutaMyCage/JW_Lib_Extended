SONG 49 Making Jehovah’s Heart Glad

Brothers​—Are You Reaching Out to Be a Ministerial Servant?


“There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—ACTS 20:35.


FOCUS
To encourage baptized brothers to reach out and qualify as ministerial servants.


 1. How did the apostle Paul feel about ministerial servants?

Your answer


MINISTERIAL servants perform vital work in the congregations. The apostle Paul obviously appreciated these loyal men. For instance, when writing to Christians in Philippi, he specifically greeted the ministerial servants along with the elders.​—Phil. 1:1.
 2. How does a brother named Luis feel about his assignment as a ministerial servant?

Your answer


2 Whether young or old, many baptized brothers find great joy in being ministerial servants. For example, Devan was 18 when he was appointed. On the other hand, a brother named Luis was appointed in his early 50’s. He summed up the feeling of many when he said, “I feel so privileged to do the work of a ministerial servant, especially when I think of all the love the congregation has shown me!”
 3. What questions will we consider?

Your answer


3 If you are a baptized brother and you are not yet a ministerial servant, could you make that your goal? What might motivate you to do so? And what are the Scriptural qualifications that you need to meet? In this article, we will consider the answers to these questions. But first, let us discuss what the role of a ministerial servant is.
WHAT IS A MINISTERIAL SERVANT’S ROLE?
 4. What is the role of a ministerial servant? (See also picture.)

Your answer


4 A ministerial servant is a baptized brother who is appointed by holy spirit to help the elders care for many practical matters in the congregation. Some ministerial servants make sure that publishers have enough territory and literature for their ministry. Others help to clean and maintain the Kingdom Hall. Ministerial servants also serve as attendants and operate the sound and video equipment during congregation meetings. Much of the work done by ministerial servants is of a practical nature. Yet, ministerial servants are first and foremost spiritual men; they love Jehovah and live by his righteous standards. And they feel a deep love for their Christian brothers and sisters. (Matt. 22:37-39) How can a baptized brother reach out to be a ministerial servant?




Ministerial servants imitate Jesus by giving of themselves to serve others (See paragraph 4)




 5. What does it mean to reach out?

Your answer


5 The Bible outlines the qualifications for those who may be appointed as ministerial servants. (1 Tim. 3:8-10, 12, 13) You can reach out for this privilege by studying these Scriptural qualifications and then working hard to meet them. But first, you need to give careful attention to your motives for reaching out.
WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO REACH OUT?
 6. What should motivate you to perform any kind of service for your brothers and sisters? (Matthew 20:28; see also picture.)

Your answer


6 Our greatest example, Jesus Christ, was motivated by love​—love for his Father and love for people. That love moved him to work hard and perform humble tasks for others. (Read Matthew 20:28; John 13:5, 14, 15) If you are motivated by love, Jehovah will bless you and will help you to reach your goal of qualifying as a ministerial servant.​—1 Cor. 16:14; 1 Pet. 5:5.




By example, Jesus teaches his apostles to serve others humbly rather than to seek a position of prominence (See paragraph 6)




 7. Why should a brother avoid selfish ambition?

Your answer


7 In the world, people who promote themselves are often admired. Not so in Jehovah’s organization. A brother who is motivated by love, as Jesus was, does not crave power, authority over others, or status. If such an ambitious person were to be appointed in the congregation, he would likely refuse to do some of the humble tasks needed to care for Jehovah’s precious sheep. He might consider such tasks to be beneath him. (John 10:12) Jehovah will not bless the efforts of anyone who is driven by pride or selfish ambition.​—1 Cor. 10:24, 33; 13:4, 5.
 8. What counsel did Jesus give his apostles?

Your answer


8 At times, even Jesus’ closest companions reached out for privileges for the wrong reason. Consider an event involving two of Jesus’ apostles​—James and John. They asked Jesus to give them special prominence in his Kingdom. Jesus did not commend them for their ambition. Instead, he explained to all 12 apostles: “Whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister, and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all.” (Mark 10:35-37, 43, 44) Brothers who reach out with the proper motive​—that is, to serve others—​will be a blessing to the congregation.​—1 Thess. 2:8.
WHAT CAN STRENGTHEN YOUR DESIRE TO REACH OUT?
 9. How can you strengthen your desire to reach out?

Your answer


9 No doubt you love Jehovah and want to serve others. Even so, you may lack the desire to take on the extra work required of a ministerial servant. How can you strengthen your desire to serve? Why not think about the joys that can come from serving your brothers and sisters? Jesus said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (Acts 20:35) He lived by this principle. He found real joy in serving others, and so can you.
10. How did Jesus show that he was happy to serve others? (Mark 6:31-34)

Your answer


10 Consider an example of how Jesus showed that he was happy to serve others. (Read Mark 6:31-34.) On one occasion, Jesus and his apostles were tired. They were on their way to an isolated place to get some rest. But a crowd got there ahead of them, hoping to be taught by Jesus. He could have said no. After all, he and his companions “had no leisure time even to eat a meal.” Or Jesus could have sent the people away after sharing only one or two truths. But because he was motivated by love, he “started to teach them many things.” And he continued teaching them until “the hour had grown late.” (Mark 6:35) He did so, not because he had to, but because “he was moved with pity for them.” He wanted to teach them because he loved them. Serving others brought Jesus great joy.
11. How did Jesus serve his listeners in a practical way? (See also picture.)

Your answer


11 When Jesus ministered to the crowd, he did more than teach them. He also cared for their physical needs. He miraculously provided food and then had his disciples distribute it. (Mark 6:41) By doing so, he taught his disciples how to serve others. He also showed them that practical services​—such as those that ministerial servants might render—​are important. Imagine the joy the apostles had in sharing with Jesus in this miraculous distribution of food until “all ate and were satisfied”! (Mark 6:42) Of course, this was not the only time that Jesus put the welfare of others ahead of his own. He used his entire earthly life to serve people. (Matt. 4:23; 8:16) Jesus found joy and satisfaction in teaching others and in humbly caring for their needs. No doubt you too will experience much joy as you unselfishly reach out to be a ministerial servant.




Love for Jehovah and a desire to serve others will move you to serve the congregation in any capacity (See paragraph 11)a




12. Why do none of us have reason to feel that we have little to offer the congregation?

Your answer


12 If you feel that you do not have any outstanding ability, do not be discouraged. No doubt you have qualities that can make you useful in the congregation. You might benefit from prayerfully reading Paul’s reasoning found at 1 Corinthians 12:12-30. Paul’s words make it clear that you, like every other servant of Jehovah, have a necessary and valuable role to play in the congregation. If you do not presently meet the qualifications to serve as a ministerial servant, do not despair. Instead, why not do whatever you can to be useful to Jehovah and to your brothers? Be assured that the elders will take your abilities into consideration with regard to any assignments they may give you.​—Rom. 12:4-8.
13. What is true of most of the qualifications for appointed men?

Your answer


13 Consider one more reason why you should reach out to qualify as a ministerial servant: Most of the qualifications apply to all Christians. In fact, all Christians should draw close to Jehovah, experience the joy of giving, and set a good example in Christian living. What, specifically, can a brother do to reach out?
HOW TO REACH OUT
14. What does it mean to “be serious”? (1 Timothy 3:8-10, 12)

Your answer


14 Let us now consider some of the qualifications outlined at 1 Timothy 3:8-10, 12. (Read.) A ministerial servant must “be serious.” That expression may also be translated “worthy of respect,” “dignified,” or “honorable.” This does not mean that you can never laugh or enjoy humor. (Eccl. 3:1, 4) However, you should take all your responsibilities seriously. If you have a reputation for being reliable and dependable, you will gain the respect of the congregation.
15. What is meant by “not double-tongued” and “not greedy of dishonest gain”?

Your answer


15 “Not double-tongued” means that you are sincere, honest, and trustworthy. You keep your word, and you do not deceive others. (Prov. 3:32) “Not greedy of dishonest gain” means that you are honest in your business dealings and in handling money. You would not take advantage of your good relationships with fellow Christians to make money.
16. (a) What does “not indulging in a lot of wine” mean? (b) What does it mean to have “a clean conscience”?

Your answers


16 “Not indulging in a lot of wine” means that you do not overindulge in alcohol or have a reputation for being a heavy drinker. Having “a clean conscience” means that you live according to Jehovah’s standards. Although you are not perfect, you enjoy the peace that comes from a good relationship with God.
17. How can a brother show himself trustworthy while being “tested as to fitness”? (1 Timothy 3:10; see also picture.)

Your answer


17 “Tested as to fitness” means that you have already shown that you can be trusted with responsibility. Therefore, when the elders give you an assignment, carefully follow their instructions and the guidelines provided by the organization. Make sure that you understand what the assignment involves and when it should be completed. As you handle each assignment diligently, others in the congregation will notice and appreciate your good progress. Elders, be alert to train baptized brothers. (Read 1 Timothy 3:10.) Are there baptized brothers in your congregation who are in their early teens or younger? Are they exemplary in their personal study habits? Do they regularly comment at meetings and share in the field ministry? If so, give them assignments that are appropriate to their age and circumstances. In this way, these young brothers can be “tested as to fitness.” Then by the time they are in their late teens, they can likely qualify as ministerial servants.




By giving baptized brothers assignments, elders can test them “as to fitness” (See paragraph 17)




18. What does it mean to be “free from accusation”?

Your answer


18 “Free from accusation” means that no valid charge of serious wrongdoing can be brought against you. Of course, Christians might be falsely accused. Jesus was the subject of false accusations, and he foretold that his followers would experience the same. (John 15:20) However, if you keep your conduct clean, as Jesus did, you will gain a fine reputation in the congregation.​—Matt. 11:19.
19. What does being “husbands of one wife” involve?

Your answer


19 “Husbands of one wife.” If married, you must hold to Jehovah’s original standard for marriage​—one man and one woman. (Matt. 19:3-9) A Christian man should never commit sexual immorality. (Heb. 13:4) But more is involved. You must be loyal to your wife, never giving inappropriate attention to other women.​—Job 31:1.
20. How does a man preside over his household “in a fine manner”?

Your answer


20 “Presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households.” If you are a family head, you must take your responsibilities seriously. Conduct family worship regularly. Share in the ministry with each member of your family as frequently as you can. Help your children to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah. (Eph. 6:4) A man who cares for his family shows that he can look after the congregation.​—Compare 1 Timothy 3:5.
21. If you are not yet serving as a ministerial servant, what can you do?

Your answer


21 Brothers, if you are not yet serving as a ministerial servant, please prayerfully consider the material in this article. Study the qualifications for ministerial servants and work hard to meet those qualifications. Think about how much you love Jehovah and your brothers and sisters. Deepen your desire to serve them. (1 Pet. 4:8, 10) Experience the joy that comes from serving your spiritual family. May Jehovah richly bless your efforts to reach out to serve as a ministerial servant!​—Phil. 2:13.
