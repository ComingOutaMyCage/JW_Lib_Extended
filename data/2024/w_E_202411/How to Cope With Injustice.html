<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JESUS told an illustration about a widow who kept asking a judge to give her justice. No doubt that story resonated with many of Jesus’ disciples because in his day the common people were often victims of injustice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:1-42:18:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 18:1-5</a>) The story is also meaningful to us today because we have all experienced injustice at one time or another.</p>

Of course, our brothers and sisters are not opposers of the truth. They are simply imperfect. We can learn much from how Jesus reacted to injustices from wicked opposers. If we can be patient with opposers who treat us unjustly, how much more so should we be patient with our fellow believers! How does Jehovah feel when we are treated unjustly either by those outside the congregation or by those inside the congregation? Does he care?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:12-19:73:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 73:12</a>) He was also so distraught about the injustice he saw that he almost lost confidence in <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>the benefits of serving Jehovah, saying: “When I tried to understand it, it was troubling to me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:14-19:73:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 73:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:16-19:73:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16</a>) In fact, he revealed: “As for me, my feet had almost strayed; my steps had nearly slipped.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:2-19:73:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 73:2</a>) Something similar happened to a brother we will call Alberto.</p>

Alberto says: “I prayed for the brothers who treated me unfairly. I asked Jehovah several times to help me put this injustice behind me.” Happily, Alberto is again serving Jehovah faithfully. John says: “Many times, I prayed for the brother who hurt me. Such prayers helped me view him more objectively, without judging him. And those prayers also gave me peace of mind.”</p>

Whatever comes our way, let us never stop praying to Jehovah for help. Also, may we imitate the way Jesus responded to mistreatment and continue to apply Bible principles. If we do, we can be sure of inheriting a blessing from Jehovah.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 3:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
