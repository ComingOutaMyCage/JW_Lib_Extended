SONG 103 Shepherds​—Gifts in Men

Brothers​—Are You Reaching Out to Serve as an Elder?


“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.”​—1 TIM. 3:1.


FOCUS
Some of the Scriptural requirements that a brother must meet in order to serve as an elder.


1-2. What does the “fine work” of an elder involve?

Your answer


IF YOU have been serving for a time as a ministerial servant, you may be well on your way to qualifying to serve as an elder. Can you reach out for that “fine work”?​—1 Tim. 3:1.
2 What does the work of an elder involve? He takes the lead in preaching, works hard in shepherding and teaching, and builds up the congregation by word and example. For good reason, the Bible calls hardworking elders “gifts in men.”​—Eph. 4:8.
 3. How can a brother qualify to serve as an elder? (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9)

Your answer


3 How can you qualify to serve as an elder? Qualifying as an elder is not the same as qualifying for a secular job. Often in the secular world, if you have the basic work skills that an employer is looking for, you can get the job. By contrast, if you wish to be appointed as an elder, you need more than preaching and teaching skills. You need to meet the Scriptural qualifications for elders listed at 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9. (Read.) This article will discuss what is required of elders in three key areas: gaining a fine reputation both inside and outside the congregation, setting a good example as a family head, and being willing to serve the congregation.
GAINING A FINE REPUTATION
 4. What does it mean to “be irreprehensible”?

Your answer


4 To qualify as an elder, you must “be irreprehensible,” that is, have a good reputation in the congregation because your conduct is above reproach. In addition, you should have “a fine testimony from outsiders.” Unbelievers may criticize your Christian beliefs, but they should have no valid reason to question your honesty or conduct. (Dan. 6:4, 5) Ask yourself, ‘Do I have a good reputation both inside and outside the congregation?’
 5. How can you show that you are “a lover of goodness”?

Your answer


5 If you are “a lover of goodness,” you look for the good in others and commend them for their fine qualities. You are also happy to do good for others, even going beyond what is required. (1 Thess. 2:8; see “lover of goodness” study note on Titus 1:8.) Why is this quality so important for elders? Because they use much of their valuable time to shepherd the congregation and care for assignments. (1 Pet. 5:1-3) Even so, the joy that comes from serving others far outweighs any sacrifice.​—Acts 20:35.
 6. What are some ways to be “hospitable”? (Hebrews 13:2, 16; see also picture.)

Your answer


6 You demonstrate that you are “hospitable” when you do good things for others, including those outside your circle of close friends. (1 Pet. 4:9) One reference work describes a hospitable man this way: “The door of his house​—and of his heart—​must be open to strangers.” Ask yourself, ‘What is my reputation when it comes to welcoming visitors?’ (Read Hebrews 13:2, 16.) A hospitable man shares what he can with visitors, including lowly ones of little means and hardworking servants, such as circuit overseers and visiting speakers.​—Gen. 18:2-8; Prov. 3:27; Luke 14:13, 14; Acts 16:15; Rom. 12:13.

 7. How does an elder show that he is “not a lover of money”?

Your answer


7 “Not a lover of money.” This means that you are not focused on material things. Whether you are rich or poor, you put Kingdom interests first in all aspects of your life. (Matt. 6:33) You use your time, energy, and other resources to worship Jehovah, to care for your family, and to serve the congregation. (Matt. 6:24; 1 John 2:15-17) Ask yourself: ‘How do I view money? Am I content with the necessary things? Or am I focused on making money and acquiring more material possessions?’​—1 Tim. 6:6, 17-19.
 8. What are some ways you show that you are “moderate in habits” and “self-controlled”?

Your answer


8 If you are “moderate in habits” and “self-controlled,” you are balanced in all areas of your life. This includes avoiding extremes in eating, drinking, dress and grooming, and recreation. You are not a slave to the trends of the world. (Luke 21:34; Jas. 4:4) You are levelheaded, that is, you remain calm even when provoked. You are “not a drunkard”; nor do you have a reputation as a heavy drinker. Ask yourself, ‘Does the way I live show that I am moderate in habits and self-controlled?’
 9. What is involved in being “sound in mind” and “orderly”?

Your answer


9 If you are “sound in mind,” you carefully evaluate matters based on Bible principles. You have thought deeply about these principles, and that has given you insight and understanding. You do not jump to conclusions. Instead, you make sure that you have all the necessary facts. (Prov. 18:13) As a result, you make balanced decisions that reflect Jehovah’s thinking. If you are “orderly,” you are organized and punctual. You are known for being reliable and for following direction. These qualities will contribute to your fine reputation. Let us now discuss how to meet the Scriptural qualifications in setting a good example as a family head.
SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE AS A FAMILY HEAD
10. How does a man preside “over his own household in a fine manner”?

Your answer


10 If you are a husband and want to qualify as an elder, the reputation of your family will affect your qualifications. Thus, you need to be “presiding over [your] own household in a fine manner.” You need to have a reputation for being a loving and responsible family head. This includes taking the lead in all aspects of our worship. Why is this so important? The apostle Paul reasoned: “If any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he care for the congregation of God?”​—1 Tim. 3:5.
11-12. How does the conduct of a man’s family members affect his qualifications? (See also picture.)

Your answer


11 If you are a father, you must have your minor “children in subjection with all seriousness.” You need to teach and train them lovingly. Of course, like all children, they will enjoy laughing and playing. But because of your good training, they will be obedient, respectful, and well-behaved. Also, you must do your best to help your children to develop a good relationship with Jehovah, to live by Bible principles, and to progress to baptism.
12 “Having believing children who are not accused of debauchery or rebelliousness.” If a believing child in a household becomes guilty of committing a serious sin, how would that affect the father? If the father has been negligent in providing training and discipline, he would likely not qualify to serve as an elder.​—See the October 15, 1996, issue of The Watchtower, p. 21, pars. 6-7.

SERVING THE CONGREGATION
13. How can you show that you are “reasonable,” “not self-willed”?

Your answer


13 Brothers who manifest fine Christian qualities are an asset to the congregation. A “reasonable” man promotes peace. If you want to be known as being reasonable, listen to others and be open to their viewpoints. In a meeting, would you be willing to support the decision of the majority if no Bible law or principle is violated? “Not self-willed” means that you do not insist on doing things your way. You appreciate the value of many advisers. (Gen. 13:8, 9; Prov. 15:22) You are “not quarrelsome” or “quick-tempered.” Instead of being harsh or disagreeable, you are gentle and tactful. As a peaceable man, you take the initiative to make peace, even in tense situations. (Jas. 3:17, 18) Your kind words can soften the attitude of others, including that of opposers.​—Judg. 8:1-3; Prov. 20:3; 25:15; Matt. 5:23, 24.
14. What is meant by “not . . . newly converted” and “loyal”?

Your answer


14 A brother who qualifies as an elder is “not a newly converted man.” Although you do not have to be baptized for many years, you do need time to become a mature Christian. Before you are appointed as an elder, you must demonstrate that, like Jesus, you are humble and are content to wait on Jehovah for any assignment. (Matt. 20:23; Phil. 2:5-8) You can prove that you are “loyal” by sticking to Jehovah and his righteous standards and by following the direction given through his organization.​—1 Tim. 4:15.
15. Must an elder be an excellent public speaker? Explain.

Your answer


15 The Scriptures clearly state that overseers must be “qualified to teach.” Does this mean that you must be an excellent public speaker? No. Many well-qualified elders, though not the best public speakers, teach effectively in the ministry and on shepherding calls. (See “qualified to teach” study note on 1 Timothy 3:2; compare 1 Corinthians 12:28, 29 and Ephesians 4:11.) Even so, you do need to work constantly at improving your skills as a teacher. How can you become more effective?
16. How can you become more effective as a teacher? (See also picture.)

Your answer


16 “Holding firmly to the faithful word.” To be more effective as a teacher, base your public teaching and private counsel on God’s Word. Be a good student of the Bible and of our publications. (Prov. 15:28; 16:23; see “holding firmly to the faithful word” study note on Titus 1:9.) As you study, take careful note of the proper application of the Scriptures. And when teaching, try hard to reach the heart of those in your audience. You can improve as a teacher if you ask for and apply suggestions from experienced elders. (1 Tim. 5:17) Elders need to be “able . . . to encourage” their brothers and sisters; however, elders must at times counsel or even “reprove” them. In either case, elders must always be kind. If you are gentle and loving and you base your teaching on God’s Word, you will be effective because you will be imitating the Great Teacher, Jesus.​—Matt. 11:28-30; 2 Tim. 2:24.




A ministerial servant takes advantage of an opportunity to learn how to teach from the Bible while with an experienced elder. The ministerial servant also rehearses his congregation talk in front of a mirror (See paragraph 16)




CONTINUE REACHING OUT
17. (a) What can help ministerial servants to continue reaching out? (b) What should elders keep in mind when evaluating brothers for appointment? (See the box “Be Modest When Evaluating Others.”)

Your answers


17 After reviewing the qualifications to serve as elders, some ministerial servants might feel that they could never qualify. But remember that neither Jehovah nor his organization expects you to display these qualities perfectly. (1 Pet. 2:21) And it is Jehovah’s powerful spirit that helps you to develop these qualifications. (Phil. 2:13) Is there a particular quality that you would like to improve on? Pray to Jehovah about it. Research the topic, and ask one of the elders for suggestions on how to improve.
Be Modest When Evaluating Others
When reviewing the qualifications of others, the elders modestly keep in mind their own standing before Jehovah. As a result, they are not “overly righteous.” (Eccl. 7:16; Rom. 12:3) Each elder knows that he himself does not meet the qualifications perfectly. Therefore, the elders prayerfully consider whether a brother measures up to the Scriptural qualifications to a reasonable degree. Allowing for human imperfection, the elders make their recommendations in a manner that shows due respect for Jehovah’s righteous standards and for the good of the congregation.


18. What are all ministerial servants encouraged to do?

Your answer


18 May all of us, including those already serving as elders, continue to cultivate the qualities discussed in this article. (Phil. 3:16) Are you a ministerial servant? Reach out! Ask Jehovah to train and mold you to be even more useful in serving him and the congregation. (Isa. 64:8) May Jehovah richly bless your efforts to qualify to serve as an elder.
