Some ministerial servants make sure that publishers have enough territory and literature for their ministry. Others help to clean and maintain the Kingdom Hall. Ministerial servants also serve as attendants and operate the sound and video equipment during congregation meetings. Much of the work done by ministerial servants is of a practical nature. Yet, ministerial servants are first and foremost spiritual men; they love Jehovah and live by his righteous standards. And they feel a deep love for their Christian brothers and sisters.

Therefore, when the elders give you an assignment, carefully follow their instructions and the guidelines provided by the organization. Make sure that you understand what the assignment involves and when it should be completed. As you handle each assignment diligently, others in the congregation will notice and appreciate your good progress. Elders, be alert to train baptized brothers. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:10-54:3:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 3:10</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Are there baptized brothers in your congregation who are in their early teens or younger? Are they exemplary in their personal study habits? Do they regularly comment at meetings and share in the field ministry? If so, give them assignments that are appropriate to their age and circumstances. In this way, these young brothers can be “tested as to fitness.” Then by the time they are in their late teens, they can likely qualify as ministerial servants.</p>
