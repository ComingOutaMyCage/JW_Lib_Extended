Consider, for example, Moses, David, and the apostle John. They lived at different times, and their circumstances differed greatly. As they neared the end of their life, they gave wise advice to younger ones. Each of these faithful older men emphasized the value of being obedient to God. Jehovah preserved their wise words for us today. Whether we are young or old, we can benefit by reviewing their counsel.

He recorded the awe-inspiring “revelation by Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1</a>) John wrote the Gospel bearing his name. He also wrote three inspired letters. He addressed his third letter to a faithful Christian named Gaius, whom John viewed as a beloved spiritual child. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:1-64:1:1" data-bid="33-1" class="b">3 John 1</a>) By then, there must have been many whom John viewed as his spiritual children. What this faithful older man wrote has encouraged all of Jesus’ followers down to our day.</p>

Rachel, who lives in the Dominican Republic, feels that teaching someone about the wonderful God we serve is a privilege beyond words. Reflecting on her spiritual children, she says: “It’s hard to describe the joy I feel when I watch those I teach grow to love Jehovah, make him their anchor, and adjust their lives in order to make him happy. That feeling more than makes up for any effort and sacrifice I might have made to teach them.”</p>
