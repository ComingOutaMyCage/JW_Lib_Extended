<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Would you like to get more out of your personal study? You could try these tips to have a learning-friendly environment:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4">  <strong>Select a pleasant location.</strong> If possible, find an area that is uncluttered and appropriately lit. You could sit at a desk or a table, or you could choose a comfortable location outside.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5">  <strong>Find privacy.</strong> Jesus chose to pray “early in the morning” in “an isolated place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:35-41:1:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 1:35</a>) If complete privacy is not possible, you could let your family or your housemates know your study schedule and ask for their consideration.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6">  <strong>Maintain focus.</strong> Avoid distractions. If you use your phone or tablet to study, silence the alerts or try using airplane mode in order to avoid interruptions. And if you think of something you need to do, make a brief note to handle it later. If your concentration falters, take a break to walk or stretch.</p>
