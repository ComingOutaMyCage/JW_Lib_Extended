8. How We Show Love to God


(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah is “abundant in loyal love.” (Ps 86:15) The expression “loyal love” refers to love motivated by commitment, integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment. Although Jehovah shows love to humans in general, “loyal love” describes the love that he has reserved for his servants, those who have a special relationship with him. (Ps 33:18; 63:3; Joh 3:16; Ac 14:17) We can demonstrate our appreciation for Jehovah’s loyal love by showing love to him in return. How? By obeying his commandments, including the command to “make disciples.”​—Mt 28:19; 1Jo 5:3.
