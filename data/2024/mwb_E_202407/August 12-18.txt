TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. What if We Envy Those Not Serving God?


(10 min.)

We could become envious of those not serving God (Ps 73:3-5; w20.12 19 ¶14)
We can regain the proper viewpoint by joining our brothers in worship instead of isolating ourselves (Ps 73:17; Pr 18:1; w20.12 19 ¶15-16)
Those not serving God are “on slippery ground”; those serving God are led “to glory” (Ps 73:18, 19, 24; w14 4/15 4 ¶5; w13 2/15 25-26 ¶3-5)
