7. Could You Make Someone’s Load Lighter?


(15 min.) Discussion.

None of God’s servants have to face life’s challenges alone. (2Ch 20:15; Ps 127:1) We have Jehovah as our Helper. (Isa 41:10) What are some ways that Jehovah helps us? He gives us guidance through his Word and organization. (Isa 48:17) He makes his powerful holy spirit available to us. (Lu 11:13) He also moves our brothers and sisters to give us encouragement and practical help. (2Co 7:6) This means that Jehovah can use any one of us to lighten the load of a fellow Christian.
