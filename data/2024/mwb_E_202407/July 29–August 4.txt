7. Principles for Family Worship Evening


(10 min.) Discussion.








In January 2009, the Congregation Book Study was merged with the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting into one midweek meeting. This gave families an evening each week to have a personalized program of family worship. Many have expressed appreciation for this arrangement that was made to help them draw closer to Jehovah and to one another.​—De 6:6, 7.
What are some principles that can help family heads make their Family Worship evening a success?
  Keep it regular. If possible, have a set time for family worship each week. Have an alternate day for when the schedule is disrupted

  Prepare. Consult with your wife, and occasionally ask your children for suggestions. Preparation does not need to be extensive, especially if the family enjoys doing some of the same types of activities every week

  Tailor the program to your family. As children get older, their needs and abilities change. Your program should help each member of the family to grow spiritually

  Maintain a loving, relaxed atmosphere. At times, consider studying outdoors when the weather is favorable. Feel free to take needed breaks. While attention should be given to address specific challenges in the family, do not use family worship to scold or discipline

  Have some variety. For example, your session might include preparing a portion of an upcoming meeting, watching and discussing a video from jw.org, and having practice sessions for the ministry. Although discussions should be the centerpiece of Family Worship evening, time could also be included for family members to engage in personal study


Discuss this question:
  How have you tried to apply these principles in your family worship?
