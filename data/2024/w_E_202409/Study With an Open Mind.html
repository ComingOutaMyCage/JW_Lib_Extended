<p id="p3" data-pid="3">As we prepare to study, we might ask ourselves, ‘What do I expect to learn?’ However, we do well to be careful not to let our expectations blind us to what Jehovah is teaching us. How can we keep an open mind when we study?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Pray for wisdom.</strong> Ask Jehovah to help you discern what he wants you to learn <strong><em>now.</em></strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>) Avoid relying solely on your past understanding.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Respect the Bible’s unique power.</strong> “The word of God is alive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) God’s living “word” can influence us differently each time we read the Bible​—but only if we are open to what we may learn or gain from it as we read.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Appreciate everything on Jehovah’s table.</strong> His spiritual food is like “a banquet of rich dishes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 25:6</a>) Avoid skipping “dishes” that you do not expect to enjoy. Not only will you benefit but you will really delight in what God provides!</p>
