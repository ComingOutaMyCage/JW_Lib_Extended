Realizing that makes us happy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:13</a>) As we put into practice what we read in God’s inspired Word, we improve our family life and build strong friendships with fellow believers. That has likely proved to be true in your life. Moreover, we avoid many of the problems that come to those who do not follow Jehovah’s ways. Indeed, we agree with King David. After mentioning in song the law, orders, and judgments of Jehovah, he concluded: “In keeping them, there is a large reward.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7-11</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Most of Jehovah’s people lead very busy lives. We spend a great amount of time caring for our various Scriptural responsibilities. For instance, most of us work secularly to provide for ourselves and for our families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) Many Christians look after sick or elderly relatives. And all of us need to care for our own health, which takes time. In addition to these responsibilities, we have assignments in the congregation. A key responsibility is to have a zealous share in the preaching work. With all the obligations that you personally have, how can you find the time to read the Bible regularly, meditate on what you read, and apply what it says?</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Bible reading is one of “the more important things” for us as Christians, so we need to make it a priority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 1:10</a>) Regarding the happy man, the very first psalm says: “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads His law in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Clearly, that suggests setting time aside for such reading. When is the best time to read the Bible? The answer may be different for each of us. But put simply, it would be a time when you can do so regularly. A brother named Victor says: “I like to do my Bible reading in the morning. Even though I’m not a morning <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>person, there are fewer distractions in the early hours. My mind is clear and I can focus better.” Might this be true in your case? Ask yourself, ‘When is the best time for <strong><em>me</em></strong> to read the Bible?’</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The reality is, though, that we may consistently read a lot of material without really absorbing it. Have you ever read something and shortly afterward could recall little of what you read? We all have had that happen. Sadly, this can be the situation with our Bible reading. Perhaps we set a goal to read a certain number of chapters of the Bible each day. That is commendable. We <strong><em>should</em></strong> set goals and strive to stick to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:26-46:9:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:26</a>) However, reading the Bible is a start​—a good start, but only a start.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Think of this comparison: Water, often in the form of rain, is essential to life. But if too much rain falls within a short amount of time, the ground may become oversaturated. When that happens, more rain will not be beneficial. The soil needs time to absorb the rain that has fallen and make it available to the vegetation. Likewise, we should avoid reading the Bible in a hurried manner, that is, so quickly that we fail to absorb and remember and use what we read.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:24-59:1:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 1:24</a>.</p>

If the encouragement to meditate seems that way to you, perhaps you could view meditating as simply thinking about what you <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>have read. You may decide to lengthen your study period to include time for such thinking, or meditation. On the other hand, you may choose to read fewer verses and use the remaining time to think over what you have read. “I keep my Bible reading short, maybe one chapter,” says Victor, quoted earlier. “Because I read early in the morning, I’m able to keep reflecting throughout the day on what I read.” Whatever method you use, it is vital to read at a pace that will allow you to get the most out of what you read.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 119:97</a>; see the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2024560/67-72">Questions to Consider</a>.”</p>

(Read.)</strong> After reading those two verses, you could stop and think of how often and how deeply you pray. Also, you could reflect on things for which you are grateful. Maybe you determine that you will thank Jehovah for three specific things. With even a few minutes of such focused attention, you will to some extent become a hearer and a doer of God’s Word. Think of how you would benefit by repeating this process each day with other portions of the Bible that you read! Yes, you will grow as a doer of God’s Word.
