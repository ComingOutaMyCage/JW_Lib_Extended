SONG 125 “Happy Are the Merciful!”

Enjoy the Greater Happiness That Comes From Giving


“There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—ACTS 20:35.


FOCUS
Ways we can maintain and even increase the joy we find in giving.


1-2. How do we benefit from being created with the ability to find more happiness in giving than in receiving?

Your answer


WHEN Jehovah created humans, he designed them with the ability to find more happiness in giving than in receiving. (Acts 20:35) Does this mean that we do not gain any happiness from receiving? No. We know from experience that we feel good when we receive a gift. Still, we feel even greater happiness when we are the giver. And really, it is to our benefit that Jehovah made us this way. Why?
2 By creating us the way he did, Jehovah allows us to influence our happiness. We can increase our joy by looking for additional opportunities to give. Is that not a wonderful aspect of how we are made?​—Ps. 139:14.
 3. Why can Jehovah be described as “the happy God”?

Your answer


3 The Scriptures assure us that giving brings happiness, so it is little wonder that the Bible describes Jehovah as “the happy God.” (1 Tim. 1:11) He is the original and greatest Giver. Because of him, “we have life and move and exist,” as the apostle Paul stated. (Acts 17:28) Indeed, “every good gift and every perfect present” comes from Jehovah.​—Jas. 1:17.
 4. What will help us to experience more happiness?

Your answer


4 All of us would probably like to experience even more of the happiness that comes from giving. We can do so by imitating Jehovah’s generosity. (Eph. 5:1) As we consider this, let us note what we can do if we feel that our giving is not appreciated. These reminders will help us to maintain and even increase the joy we get from giving.
IMITATE JEHOVAH’S GENEROSITY
 5. What material things does Jehovah give us?

Your answer


5 What are some ways that Jehovah shows generosity? Consider a few examples. Jehovah gives us material things. We may not always have luxuries, but thanks to Jehovah, most of us have what we need. For example, he makes it possible for us to have food, clothing, and shelter. (Ps. 4:8; Matt. 6:31-33; 1 Tim. 6:6-8) Does Jehovah provide for our physical needs merely out of a sense of obligation? Not at all! Why does Jehovah do this for us?
 6. What do we learn from Matthew 6:25, 26?

Your answer


6 Put simply, Jehovah provides for our physical needs because he loves us. Consider Jesus’ words found at Matthew 6:25, 26. (Read.) Jesus uses examples from creation. Speaking of birds, Jesus says: “They do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses.” However, notice what he next says: “Your heavenly Father feeds them.” Then Jesus asks: “Are you not worth more than they are?” The point? Jehovah views his worshippers as far more valuable than animal creation. If Jehovah cares for the needs of animals, we can be sure that he will provide for us! Like a caring human father, Jehovah provides for his family out of love.​—Ps. 145:16; Matt. 6:32.
 7. What is one way we can imitate Jehovah’s generosity? (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 Like Jehovah, we too can give materially out of love. For example, are you acquainted with a fellow believer who is in need of food or clothing? Jehovah can use you to give him something to help fill that need. Jehovah’s people are especially known for showing generosity when disaster strikes. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, brothers and sisters shared food, clothing, and other supplies with ones who were in need. Many also made generous contributions to the worldwide work. That helped to fund relief efforts around the globe. They took to heart the words of Hebrews 13:16: “Do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”




All of us can imitate Jehovah’s example of generosity (See paragraph 7)




 8. In what ways do we benefit from Jehovah’s power? (Philippians 2:13)

Your answer


8 Jehovah gives power. Jehovah is happy to share his limitless strength with his faithful worshippers. (Read Philippians 2:13.) Have you ever prayed for the strength to resist temptation or for the power to endure a difficult trial? You may also have prayed simply for enough energy to keep going one more day. When your prayer for strength was answered, you could agree with the apostle Paul, who wrote: “For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.”​—Phil. 4:13.
 9. How can we imitate Jehovah’s generous use of power? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 Though we are imperfect humans, we can imitate Jehovah’s generous use of power. We cannot literally impart strength, or energy, to others. But we can use our power in their behalf. For example, we might run errands or do household chores for an elderly or infirm Christian. If our circumstances permit, we could volunteer to help with the cleaning and the maintenance of the Kingdom Hall. Our use of power in such ways benefits others who worship Jehovah.




We can use our power in behalf of others (See paragraph 9)




10. How can we use the power of words to benefit others?

Your answer


10 Do not forget, too, that words have power. Can you think of someone who would benefit from sincere commendation? Do you know of anyone in need of comfort? In either case, why not take the initiative to reach out to the individual? You can visit in person, call on the telephone, or perhaps send a card, an email, or a text message. What you say does not have to be eloquent. A few simple words from the heart may be exactly what your fellow believer needs to remain faithful for another day or to feel better about his situation.​—Prov. 12:25; Eph. 4:29.
11. How does Jehovah use his wisdom?

Your answer


11 Jehovah gives wisdom. The disciple James wrote: “If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without finding fault.” (Jas. 1:5; ftn.) As these words indicate, Jehovah does not hoard his wisdom. He generously shares it with others. Notice, too, that when Jehovah gives wisdom, he does so “without reproaching,” or “without finding fault.” He never makes us feel bad for admitting that we need his guidance. Actually, he urges us to seek it.​—Prov. 2:1-6.
12. What opportunities do we have to share our wisdom?

Your answer


12 What about us? Can we imitate Jehovah by sharing our wisdom? (Ps. 32:8) Jehovah’s people have many opportunities to share what they have learned. For instance, we often train new ones in the ministry. Elders patiently help ministerial servants and baptized brothers to learn how to handle their assignments in the congregation. And those with experience in construction and maintenance help train less experienced ones to do work on theocratic facilities.
13. When training others, how can we imitate Jehovah’s manner of sharing wisdom?

Your answer


13 Those who provide training do well to imitate the manner in which Jehovah shares his wisdom. Recall that Jehovah gives wisdom generously. Likewise, we freely share our knowledge and experience with those who are learning. We do not withhold some of our knowledge out of fear that the learner may eventually replace us. Nor do we take the view: ‘No one trained me! Let him learn on his own.’ Such an attitude has no place among Jehovah’s people. Rather, we gladly impart not only our knowledge “but also our very selves” to those we train. (1 Thess. 2:8) We hope that they, “in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.” (2 Tim. 2:1, 2) In that sense, we can be part of an ongoing cycle of generosity that results in a cycle of happiness.
IF OUR GIVING SEEMS UNAPPRECIATED
14. How do most respond to our generosity?

Your answer


14 When we are generous, especially toward our brothers and sisters, they often express appreciation in return. They may send a thank-you note or express their gratitude in another way. (Col. 3:15) Receiving such expressions of appreciation adds to our happiness.
15. What should we remember when some do not express appreciation?

Your answer


15 Realistically, though, some may not always show or express appreciation. On occasion, we may give of our time, energy, or resources but thereafter wonder if the recipient even cared about what we did. If that happens, how can we avoid losing our joy or becoming bitter? Remember the words of our theme scripture, Acts 20:35. Our happiness in giving does not depend on the response. We can choose to enjoy giving even if others do not seem appreciative. How? Consider a few ways.
16. What should we focus on when giving?

Your answer


16 Focus on imitating Jehovah. He gives good things to people whether they appreciate it or not. (Matt. 5:43-48) Jehovah promises that when we likewise give “without hoping for anything back,” our “reward will be great.” (Luke 6:35) “Anything” might include an expression of appreciation. Whether we receive it or not, Jehovah will always repay us for the good we do to help others, for our being ‘cheerful givers.’​—Prov. 19:17; 2 Cor. 9:7.
17. How can we maintain the right focus? (Luke 14:12-14)

Your answer


17 As to maintaining the right focus when giving, we find a valuable principle at Luke 14:12-14. (Read.) It is not wrong to show hospitality or to be generous in other ways with those who can do something similar for us in return. However, what if we notice that we have been giving​—at least in part—​because we hope to receive something in return? We would do well to try what Jesus suggested. We can be hospitable to someone who we know does not have the means to show us hospitality. Then we will be happy because we are imitating Jehovah. That same outlook will also help us to keep our joy when others do not express appreciation.
18. What can help us to make allowances for others?

Your answer


18 Avoid questioning others’ motives. (1 Cor. 13:7) If others do not express appreciation, we could ask ourselves: ‘Are they truly unappreciative, or did they simply forget to express appreciation?’ Perhaps there are other reasons why they did not respond as we may have hoped. Some may feel deep gratitude but have difficulty expressing it. They might be embarrassed to receive help, especially if in the past they were the ones helping others. Whatever the case, Christian love will move us to make allowances for our fellow believers and to keep finding joy in giving.​—Eph. 4:2.
19-20. Why is patience beneficial when we give to others? (See also picture.)

Your answer


19 Be patient. With regard to being generous, wise King Solomon wrote: “Cast your bread on the waters, for after many days you will find it again.” (Eccl. 11:1) As these words indicate, some may respond to our generosity long after the fact​—“after many days.” Consider an experience that highlights this truth.
20 Many years ago, the wife of a circuit overseer sent a heartfelt note to a newly baptized sister, urging her to remain faithful. About eight years later, the sister replied in a letter, saying: “I felt I just had to write and tell you of the help you have been to me over the years without your really being aware of it.” She went on: “[Your note] was very warm, but it was the scripture that reached my heart, and I never forgot it.”a After explaining some of the challenges she had faced, the sister said: “At times I wanted out, out of the truth, out of the responsibilities​—just out. But that scripture you wrote would tug at my heart, and I would . . . keep going.” She added: “No single thing in all those eight years had such an effect on me.” Just imagine how happy the circuit overseer’s wife was to receive this letter “after many days”! We too may receive expressions of appreciation long after we have given of ourselves in some way.




We may receive an expression of appreciation long after we have given of ourselves (See paragraph 20)b




21. Why are you determined to keep imitating Jehovah’s generosity?

Your answer


21 As mentioned, Jehovah created us with a special ability. Although we enjoy receiving, we gain even greater happiness when we give to others. We feel good when we are able to help our fellow believers. And we are happy when they express their appreciation. Yet, whether the receiver expresses appreciation or not, we can be glad that we did the right thing. Never forget that whatever you give, “Jehovah has the means to give you much more.” (2 Chron. 25:9) We simply cannot outgive Jehovah! And there is no greater joy than to be repaid by Jehovah himself. Let us be determined, then, to continue imitating our generous heavenly Father.
