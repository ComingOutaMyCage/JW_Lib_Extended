SONG 25 A Special Possession

Are You Heeding the Warnings?


“One will be taken along and the other abandoned.”​—MATT. 24:40.


FOCUS
We will consider three of Jesus’ parables and discuss how they relate to the time of judgment that will occur at the end of this system of things.


 1. What judgment will soon take place?

Your answer


WE LIVE in a climactic time! Soon, Jesus will judge every living person. Jesus described the time leading up to this judgment by giving his disciples a prophetic “sign” of his invisible presence and of “the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matt. 24:3) This prophecy is recorded in Matthew chapters 24 and 25 and in the parallel accounts of Mark chapter 13 and Luke chapter 21.
 2. On what will we focus our attention, and why will this help us?

Your answer


2 Jesus provided helpful warnings by means of three parables. These are the parables of the sheep and the goats, the discreet and the foolish virgins, and the talents. Each parable helps us to understand how a person’s behavior will affect the way he will be judged. As we review these parables, let us identify the lessons and how we can apply them. The first parable we will discuss is that of the sheep and the goats.
THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS
 3. When will Jesus judge people?

Your answer


3 In the parable of the sheep and the goats, Jesus described the judgment of people who have the opportunity to respond to the good news and to support his anointed brothers. (Matt. 25:31-46) During the “great tribulation,” he will render this judgment right before Armageddon. (Matt. 24:21) Just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, Jesus will separate those who loyally support his anointed followers from those who do not.
 4. According to Isaiah 11:3, 4, why can we be sure that Jesus will judge people fairly? (See also picture.)

Your answer


4 Bible prophecy shows that as Jehovah’s appointed Judge, Jesus will be righteous in his judgment. (Read Isaiah 11:3, 4.) He observes the conduct, attitude, and speech of people​—including how they treat his anointed brothers. (Matt. 12:36, 37; 25:40) Jesus will know who gave support to his anointed brothers and their work.a One of the primary ways that sheeplike ones support Christ’s brothers is by assisting them in the preaching work. Those who provide this support will be judged as “righteous” and will have the prospect of “everlasting life” on earth. (Matt. 25:46; Rev. 7:16, 17) What a marvelous reward for those who keep their integrity! By remaining faithful during the great tribulation and beyond, they keep their names in “the book of life.”​—Rev. 20:15.




In the near future, Jesus will judge whether individuals have proved to be like sheep or like goats (See paragraph 4)




 5. What is the lesson of the parable of the sheep and the goats, and who should be interested in it?

Your answer


5 Prove yourself faithful and loyal. Jesus’ parable of the sheep and the goats focuses primarily on those who have the earthly hope. They express their faith not only by assisting Christ’s brothers in the preaching work but also by loyally accepting the lead of the small group of anointed brothers whom Jesus has selected. (Matt. 24:45) But those with a heavenly hope also need to heed the warning message of the parable. Why? Because Jesus takes note of their conduct, attitude, and speech. They too must prove faithful. In fact, Jesus related two other parables that contain specific warnings for the anointed. We also find these parables in Matthew chapter 25. Let us next discuss the parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins.
THE DISCREET AND THE FOOLISH VIRGINS
 6. How did five of the virgins prove to be discreet? (Matthew 25:6-10)

Your answer


6 In the parable of the virgins, Jesus spoke of ten virgins who went out to meet a bridegroom. (Matt. 25:1-4) They all hoped to accompany the bridegroom to his marriage feast. Jesus described five of them as “discreet” and the other five as “foolish.” The discreet virgins were prepared and vigilant. They were ready to wait for the bridegroom as long as needed, even if he arrived late at night. Thus, they brought oil lamps to provide light in the dark. They even brought extra oil in case the bridegroom should delay. So they were prepared to keep their lamps burning. (Read Matthew 25:6-10.) When the bridegroom arrived, the discreet virgins went in with him to the wedding feast. In like manner, anointed Christians who have proved ready by remaining vigilant and faithful until the coming of Christ will be judged worthy of joining the Bridegroom, Jesus, in his heavenly Kingdom.b (Rev. 7:1-3) What of the five foolish virgins?
 7. What happened to the five foolish virgins, and why?

Your answer


7 Unlike the discreet virgins, the five foolish ones were not ready when the bridegroom arrived. Their lamps were about to go out, and they brought no extra oil with them. When they learned that the bridegroom would soon arrive, they had to go buy oil. They had not returned when the bridegroom came. At that time, “the virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.” (Matt. 25:10) Later when the foolish virgins came back and wanted to enter, the bridegroom told them: “I do not know you.” (Matt. 25:11, 12) Those virgins had not been prepared to wait for the bridegroom as long as necessary. What is the lesson for anointed ones?
8-9. What lesson can anointed ones learn from the parable of the virgins? (See also picture.)

Your answer


8 Prove yourself prepared and vigilant. Jesus was not foretelling that there would be two classes of the anointed​—one that was prepared to wait until the end of this system of things and one that was not. Rather, he was explaining what would happen to anointed ones if they were not prepared to endure faithfully to the end. In that case, they would not receive their reward. (John 14:3, 4) That is sobering! Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we all should take to heart the warning from the parable of the virgins. Each of us must keep on the watch and be prepared, ready to endure to the end.​—Matt. 24:13.
9 After relating the parable of the virgins to emphasize the need to be prepared and vigilant, Jesus related the parable of the talents. That parable highlights the need to be industrious.




Each of us does well to take seriously the warning of the parable of the virgins by being prepared and vigilant, ready to endure to the end (See paragraphs 8-9)




THE TALENTS
10. How did two slaves prove faithful? (Matthew 25:19-23)

Your answer


10 In the parable of the talents, Jesus spoke of two slaves who were faithful to their master and one who was not. (Matt. 25:14-18) The two slaves proved faithful by working hard to increase their master’s interests. Before traveling abroad, he entrusted them with talents​—a large amount of money. The two faithful slaves were industrious and used the money wisely. The result? When their master returned, they had doubled the amount he had given them. The master commended them​—they entered “into the joy of [their] master.” (Read Matthew 25:19-23.) But what about the third slave? What did he do with the money his master had given him?
11. What happened to the “sluggish” slave, and why?

Your answer


11 The third slave received one talent but was “sluggish.” His master expected him to use the talent wisely. Instead, he buried it in the ground. When the master returned, this slave had nothing additional to give him. The slave did not have a good attitude. Rather than apologize for his failure to increase the master’s belongings, the slave unjustly called the master “a demanding man.” This slave did not receive his master’s approval. More than that, the talent was taken away from him and he was cast out of the master’s household.​—Matt. 25:24, 26-30.
12. Whom do the two faithful slaves represent today?

Your answer


12 The two faithful slaves represent faithful anointed Christians. The Master, Jesus, invites them to “enter into the joy of [their] master.” They receive their heavenly reward, the first resurrection. (Matt. 25:21, 23; Rev. 20:5b) On the other hand, the bad example of the sluggish slave provides a warning for anointed ones. How so?
13-14. What lesson do anointed ones learn from the parable of the talents? (See also picture.)

Your answer


13 Prove yourself industrious and diligent. In the parable of the talents, as in the parable of the virgins, Jesus was not predicting that the anointed would become sluggish. Rather, he was explaining what would happen if ever they did lose their zeal. They would fail to make their “calling and choosing sure for [themselves],” and they would not be permitted to enter into the heavenly Kingdom.​—2 Pet. 1:10.
14 Jesus’ parables about the virgins and the talents make it clear that all anointed Christians must be prepared and vigilant as well as industrious and diligent. But did Jesus say anything else that serves as a warning for the anointed? Yes, he did! Jesus’ comments found at Matthew 24:40, 41 also relate to the final judgment of anointed ones.




Jesus is interested in seeing the anointed prove themselves industrious and diligent (See paragraphs 13-14)d




WHO WILL BE “TAKEN ALONG”?
15-16. How does Matthew 24:40, 41 highlight the need for anointed ones to be watchful?

Your answer


15 Before relating the three parables, Jesus described a final judgment of the anointed that would reveal who was approved. He spoke of two men working in a field and of two women working at a hand mill. In each case, the two appear to be doing the same work, but Jesus said that one would be “taken along and the other abandoned.” (Read Matthew 24:40, 41.) He then urged his followers: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.” (Matt. 24:42) Jesus said something similar after relating the parable of the virgins. (Matt. 25:13) Are these comments connected? It appears so. Only genuine, faithful anointed ones will be “taken along,” received by Jesus into the heavenly Kingdom.​—John 14:3.
16 Prove yourself watchful. Any anointed ones who do not remain spiritually alert will not be gathered with the “chosen ones.” (Matt. 24:31) By extension, all of God’s people, regardless of their hope, should view Jesus’ words as a warning to keep on the watch and remain faithful.
17. Why should we not be concerned about when Jehovah chooses to anoint some with his holy spirit?

Your answer


17 We have come to know Jehovah well, so we trust his judgment. We are not concerned if Jehovah has chosen to anoint some faithful ones in more recent years.c We recall what Jesus said about the 11th-hour workers in his illustration of the vineyard. (Matt. 20:1-16) Those who were invited to work in the vineyard later in the day received the same wage as those who began working in it earlier. Likewise, no matter when anointed ones are selected, they will receive the heavenly reward if they are judged faithful.
HEED THE WARNINGS
18-19. What lessons and warnings have we considered?

Your answer


18 What have we considered? For those who hope to live forever on earth, the parable of the sheep and the goats highlights the need to remain faithful and loyal to Jehovah​—now and during the upcoming great tribulation. At that future time, Jesus will judge faithful ones as being worthy of departing “into everlasting life.”​—Matt. 25:46.
19 We also reviewed two parables that provide warnings for the anointed. In Jesus’ parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins, five of them proved to be wise. They were prepared and vigilant, ready to wait for the bridegroom as long as needed. But the foolish virgins were unprepared. So the bridegroom refused to allow them into his marriage feast. We too must be prepared to wait for however long it takes until Jesus brings an end to this system of things. Also, in Jesus’ parable of the talents, we considered the two faithful slaves who were industrious and diligent. They worked hard in behalf of their master and earned his approval. However, the sluggish slave was rejected. The lesson? We must keep busy in Jehovah’s service right up to the end. Finally, we considered how anointed ones must remain watchful in order to be “taken along” by Jesus to their heavenly reward. With great anticipation, such ones look forward to “being gathered together” to Jesus in heaven. After the war of Armageddon, they will share as Jesus’ bride in the marriage of the Lamb.​—2 Thess. 2:1; Rev. 19:9.
20. What will Jehovah do for those who heed his warnings?

Your answer


20 Though judgment is fast approaching, there is no reason for us to be afraid. If we remain faithful, our loving heavenly Father will give us “the power beyond what is normal” so that we “may succeed . . . in standing before the Son of man.” (2 Cor. 4:7; Luke 21:36) Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we will please our Father if we heed the warnings found in Jesus’ parables. Through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, our names will be “found written down in the book” of life.​—Dan. 12:1; Rev. 3:5.
