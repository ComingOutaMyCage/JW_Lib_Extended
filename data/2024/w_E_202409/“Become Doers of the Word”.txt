SONG 89 Listen, Obey, and Be Blessed

“Become Doers of the Word”


“Become doers of the word and not hearers only.”​—JAS. 1:22.


FOCUS
This article will help us to strengthen our desire not only to read God’s Word daily but also to think about it and apply it in our life more fully.


1-2. What makes God’s servants happy? (James 1:22-25)

Your answer


JEHOVAH and his dear Son want us to be happy. The writer of Psalm 119:2 says: “Happy are those who observe his reminders, who search for him with all their heart.” Jesus gave further assurance, saying: “Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”​—Luke 11:28.
2 As Jehovah’s worshippers, we are a happy people. Why? We have many reasons, but not to be overlooked is that we regularly read God’s Word and endeavor to apply what we learn.​—Read James 1:22-25.
 3. How do we benefit when we apply what we read in God’s Word?

Your answer


3 There are several ways in which we benefit when we “become doers of the word.” For one thing, we know that this is a key step in our pleasing Jehovah. Realizing that makes us happy. (Eccl. 12:13) As we put into practice what we read in God’s inspired Word, we improve our family life and build strong friendships with fellow believers. That has likely proved to be true in your life. Moreover, we avoid many of the problems that come to those who do not follow Jehovah’s ways. Indeed, we agree with King David. After mentioning in song the law, orders, and judgments of Jehovah, he concluded: “In keeping them, there is a large reward.”​—Ps. 19:7-11.
 4. Why is it a challenge to become doers of God’s Word?

Your answer


4 Realistically, it is not always easy for us to become doers of God’s Word. We must make time in our busy schedules to read and study the Bible in order to understand what Jehovah wants us to do. So let us review some suggestions that can help us to read it regularly. We will also consider what will help us to think about what we read and see ways in which we can apply what we learn in our life.
SET TIME ASIDE TO READ GOD’S WORD
 5. What responsibilities take up much of our time?

Your answer


5 Most of Jehovah’s people lead very busy lives. We spend a great amount of time caring for our various Scriptural responsibilities. For instance, most of us work secularly to provide for ourselves and for our families. (1 Tim. 5:8) Many Christians look after sick or elderly relatives. And all of us need to care for our own health, which takes time. In addition to these responsibilities, we have assignments in the congregation. A key responsibility is to have a zealous share in the preaching work. With all the obligations that you personally have, how can you find the time to read the Bible regularly, meditate on what you read, and apply what it says?
 6. How can you make Bible reading a priority? (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Bible reading is one of “the more important things” for us as Christians, so we need to make it a priority. (Phil. 1:10) Regarding the happy man, the very first psalm says: “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads His law in an undertone day and night.” (Ps. 1:1, 2) Clearly, that suggests setting time aside for such reading. When is the best time to read the Bible? The answer may be different for each of us. But put simply, it would be a time when you can do so regularly. A brother named Victor says: “I like to do my Bible reading in the morning. Even though I’m not a morning person, there are fewer distractions in the early hours. My mind is clear and I can focus better.” Might this be true in your case? Ask yourself, ‘When is the best time for me to read the Bible?’




When is the best time to read the Bible? When can you do so regularly? (See paragraph 6)




CONSIDER WHAT YOU READ
7-8. What might prevent us from benefiting fully from what we read? Illustrate.

Your answer


7 The reality is, though, that we may consistently read a lot of material without really absorbing it. Have you ever read something and shortly afterward could recall little of what you read? We all have had that happen. Sadly, this can be the situation with our Bible reading. Perhaps we set a goal to read a certain number of chapters of the Bible each day. That is commendable. We should set goals and strive to stick to them. (1 Cor. 9:26) However, reading the Bible is a start​—a good start, but only a start. More is needed if we are to benefit fully from reading God’s Word.
8 Think of this comparison: Water, often in the form of rain, is essential to life. But if too much rain falls within a short amount of time, the ground may become oversaturated. When that happens, more rain will not be beneficial. The soil needs time to absorb the rain that has fallen and make it available to the vegetation. Likewise, we should avoid reading the Bible in a hurried manner, that is, so quickly that we fail to absorb and remember and use what we read.​—Jas. 1:24.




Just as the ground needs time to absorb and make use of rain, we need time to reflect on and apply what we read in God’s Word (See paragraph 8)




 9. What should we do if we have developed the habit of speed-reading the Bible?

Your answer


9 Have you found that on occasion you are merely speed-reading the Bible? What should you do? Slow down. Make the effort to think about what you are reading or have just read. This does not have to be daunting. If the encouragement to meditate seems that way to you, perhaps you could view meditating as simply thinking about what you have read. You may decide to lengthen your study period to include time for such thinking, or meditation. On the other hand, you may choose to read fewer verses and use the remaining time to think over what you have read. “I keep my Bible reading short, maybe one chapter,” says Victor, quoted earlier. “Because I read early in the morning, I’m able to keep reflecting throughout the day on what I read.” Whatever method you use, it is vital to read at a pace that will allow you to get the most out of what you read.​—Ps. 119:97; see the box “Questions to Consider.”
Questions to Consider
A good way to get the most out of your Bible reading is to consider one or more of the following questions as you read:
  What does this tell me about Jehovah?

  How does this section of the Scriptures contribute to the Bible’s message?

  How can I realistically apply this in my life?

  How can I use these verses to help others?




10. Illustrate how you might apply what you are learning. (1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18)

Your answer


10 Regardless of when you do your Bible reading and how much time you spend doing it, be sure to look for ways to apply what you read. As you go over a portion of God’s Word, ask yourself, ‘How can I apply this information now or in the near future?’ To illustrate, let’s say that your Bible reading included 1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18. (Read.) After reading those two verses, you could stop and think of how often and how deeply you pray. Also, you could reflect on things for which you are grateful. Maybe you determine that you will thank Jehovah for three specific things. With even a few minutes of such focused attention, you will to some extent become a hearer and a doer of God’s Word. Think of how you would benefit by repeating this process each day with other portions of the Bible that you read! Yes, you will grow as a doer of God’s Word. What, though, if it seems that there are so many things you need to work on?
SET MODEST GOALS
11. Why might you feel overwhelmed at times? Give an example.

Your answer


11 When you read the Bible and look for ways to apply its guidance, you may at times feel overwhelmed. Think of this scenario: Today your Bible reading includes counsel against showing favoritism. (Jas. 2:1-8) You see that you could improve on how you treat others, so you decide to make some changes. Excellent! Then tomorrow you read a passage that highlights the importance of controlling your speech. (Jas. 3:1-12) You realize that on occasion your speech has been somewhat negative. So you determine that you will be more positive and upbuilding. Your Bible reading the next day includes a warning against becoming a friend of the world. (Jas. 4:4-12) You notice that you need to be more selective in your choice of entertainment. By the fourth day, you might feel rather overwhelmed by all the things you need to work on.
12. Why should you not be discouraged if your Bible reading reveals that you need to make changes? (See also footnote.)

Your answer


12 If you need to make a number of changes or improvements, do not be discouraged. This is evidence that you have a good heart condition. A person who is humble and honest with himself reads the Scriptures with a view to seeing what he needs to work on.a Remember, too, that putting on “the new personality” is an ongoing process. (Col. 3:10; compare the study note “is being made new.”) What will help you to keep being a doer of God’s Word?
13. How can you set a modest number of goals? (See also picture.)

Your answer


13 Instead of trying to apply everything you read all at once, set a modest number of goals. (Prov. 11:2) You might try this approach: Keep a list of the things you need to work on, and then select one or two of these to work on first, leaving the other items to be pursued in time. Where should you start?




Instead of trying to work on everything you read in the Bible all at once, why not set modest goals? Perhaps focus on one or two points (See paragraphs 13-14)




14. Which goals can you start with?

Your answer


14 You may decide to start with a goal that is easier for you to reach. Or you might choose to work on an area that you feel needs the most improvement. Once you have identified your goal, do research in our publications, perhaps using the Watch Tower Publications Index or the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Pray about your goal, asking Jehovah for “both the desire and the power to act.” (Phil. 2:13) Then put into practice what you have learned. Having made progress on your first goal, you will likely feel more motivated to work on another one. In fact, when you improve in one aspect of Christian living or on one Christian quality, you will probably find it easier to do so in other areas.
LET GOD’S WORD BE “AT WORK IN YOU”
15. How are Jehovah’s people different from many who read the Bible? (1 Thessalonians 2:13)

Your answer


15 Some people claim to have read the Bible dozens of times. But do they truly believe in the Bible? Have they applied it or allowed it to affect the course of their life? Sadly, often the answer is no. What a contrast with Jehovah’s people! Like first-century Christians, we accept the Bible “just as it truthfully is, as the word of God.” Moreover, we strive to demonstrate that it is at work in our life.​—Read 1 Thessalonians 2:13.
16. What can help us to become doers of the Word?

Your answer


16 It is not always easy to read and apply God’s Word. We may struggle to find time to read. Or we may tend to read at a very rapid pace and not absorb much of what we read. Or we may feel overwhelmed by all the improvements we need to make. Whatever your challenge may be, it is not insurmountable. With Jehovah’s help, you can overcome it. May we be determined to accept his help and become, not forgetful hearers, but doers of the Word. Without a doubt, the more we read God’s Word and apply it in our life, the happier we will be.​—Jas. 1:25.
