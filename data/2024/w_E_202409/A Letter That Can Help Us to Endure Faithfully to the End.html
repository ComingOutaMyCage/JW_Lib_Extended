<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HEBREW Christians living in Jerusalem and Judea went through hard times in the years following Jesus’ death. Soon after the Christian congregation was formed, intense persecution arose against it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 8:1</a>) Then some 20 years later, Christ’s followers faced serious economic hardships, possibly caused by a famine that had previously afflicted the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:27-44:11:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30</a>) However, about 61 C.E., Christians were experiencing a time of relative peace compared with what was to come. During that period, they received an inspired letter from the apostle Paul​—a letter that would prove to be very timely.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The letter to the Hebrews was timely because the peace that the Christians were experiencing would not last. Paul provided practical counsel that would help those Christians to endure the tribulation that they would soon face. The destruction of the Jewish system of things, which Jesus had foretold, was approaching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:20</a>) Of course, neither Paul nor the Christians in Judea knew exactly when that destruction would occur. Nevertheless, those Christians could use the time remaining to prepare themselves by building up such qualities as faith and endurance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:25-58:10:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12:1, 2</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Christians of a Jewish background faced a big challenge. At one time, the Jews had been Jehovah’s chosen people. Jerusalem was the earthly seat of God’s Kingdom, and the temple was the center of pure worship. All faithful Jews followed the Mosaic Law as explained by their religious leaders. Those teachings governed their diet, their view of circumcision, and even their association with Gentiles. However, Jehovah no longer accepted the Jewish sacrifices after Jesus’ death. That presented a challenge for Jewish Christians who were used to following the Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:4-58:10:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:10-58:10:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 10</a>) Even mature Christians, such as the apostle Peter, struggled to adapt to some of these changes.

That involves more than simply obeying him because he is <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>authorized to give direction.

He was in a good position to write to them about this. As a former persecutor of Christians, he knew what they were up against. He also knew how to endure persecution. After all, he experienced various forms of opposition after becoming a Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:23-47:11:25" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:23-25</a>) So Paul could speak with conviction about what it takes to endure. He reminded those Christians that when enduring trials, they needed to rely not on themselves but on Jehovah. Paul could say with courage: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:6-58:13:6" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Heb. 13:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[74]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> No doubt Paul’s letter to the Hebrews helped first-century Christians to prepare for the tribulation that they would face. Paul urged his brothers to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures. Doing so would equip them to identify and reject teachings that would undermine their faith. He encouraged them to strengthen their faith so that they would promptly follow the direction of Jesus and of those taking the lead in the congregation. And he helped Christians to build endurance by having the right view of trials and seeing the trials as an opportunity to be trained by their loving Father. May we too apply this inspired counsel. We will then be able to endure faithfully down to the end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:14-58:3:14" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Heb. 3:14</a>.</p>
