Speaking of birds, Jesus says: “They do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses.” However, notice what he next says: “Your heavenly Father feeds them.” Then Jesus asks: “Are you not worth more than they are?” The point? Jehovah views his worshippers as far more valuable than animal creation. If Jehovah cares for the needs of animals, we can be sure that he will provide for us!

About eight years later, the sister replied in a letter, saying: “I felt I just had to write and tell you of the help you have been to me over the years without your really being aware of it.” She went on: “[Your note] was very warm, but it was the scripture that reached my heart, and I never forgot it.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> After explaining some of the challenges she had faced, the sister said: “At times I wanted out, out of the truth, out of the responsibilities​—just out. But that scripture you wrote would tug at my heart, and I would . . . keep going.” She added: “No single thing in all those eight years had such an effect on me.” Just imagine how happy the circuit overseer’s wife was to receive this letter “after many days”! We too may receive expressions of appreciation long after we have given of ourselves in some way.</p>

Although we enjoy receiving, we gain even greater happiness when we give to others. We feel good when we are able to help our fellow believers. And we are happy when they express their appreciation. Yet, whether the receiver expresses appreciation or not, we can be glad that we did the right thing. Never forget that whatever you give, “Jehovah has the means to give you much more.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:25:9-14:25:9" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Chron. 25:9</a>) We simply cannot outgive Jehovah! And there is no greater joy than to be repaid by Jehovah himself. Let us be determined, then, to continue imitating our generous heavenly Father.</p>
