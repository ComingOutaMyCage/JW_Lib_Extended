They express their faith not only by assisting Christ’s brothers in the preaching work but also by loyally accepting the lead of the small group of anointed brothers whom Jesus has selected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) But those with a heavenly hope also need to heed the warning message of the parable. Why? Because Jesus takes note of their conduct, attitude, and speech. They too must prove faithful. In fact, Jesus related two other parables that contain specific warnings for the anointed. We also find these parables in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:1-40:25:46" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 25</a>. Let us next discuss the parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:13-40:25:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 25:13</a>) Are these comments connected? It appears so. Only genuine, faithful anointed ones will be “taken along,” received by Jesus into the heavenly Kingdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:3-43:14:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 14:3</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:1-40:20:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 20:1-16</a>) Those who were invited to work in the vineyard later in the day received the same wage as those who began working in it earlier. Likewise, no matter when anointed ones are selected, they will receive the heavenly reward if they are judged faithful.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[73]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> What have we considered? For those who hope to live forever on earth, the parable of the sheep and the goats highlights the need to remain <strong><em>faithful and loyal</em></strong> to Jehovah​—now and during the upcoming great tribulation. At that future time, Jesus will judge faithful ones as being worthy of departing “into everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 25:46</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[73]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> We also reviewed two parables that provide warnings for the anointed. In <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>Jesus’ parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins, five of them proved to be wise. They were <strong><em>prepared and vigilant,</em></strong> ready to wait for the bridegroom as long as needed. But the foolish virgins were unprepared. So the bridegroom refused to allow them into his marriage feast. We too must be prepared to wait for however long it takes until Jesus brings an end to this system of things. Also, in Jesus’ parable of the talents, we considered the two faithful slaves who were <strong><em>industrious and diligent.</em></strong> They worked hard in behalf of their master and earned his approval. However, the sluggish slave was rejected. The lesson? We must keep busy in Jehovah’s service right up to the end. Finally, we considered how anointed ones must remain <strong><em>watchful</em></strong> in order to be “taken along” by Jesus to their heavenly reward. With great anticipation, such ones look forward to “being gathered together” to Jesus in heaven. After the war of Armageddon, they will share as Jesus’ bride in the marriage of the Lamb.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:1-53:2:1" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:9-66:19:9" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:9</a>.</p>
