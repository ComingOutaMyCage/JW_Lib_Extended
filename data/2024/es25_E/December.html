He is “the Almighty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:8-66:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 1:8</a>) So he is powerful enough to defeat any enemy, even death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:26</a>) Another reason why we know that God is capable of resurrecting the dead is that he has a limitless memory. He calls each star by its name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) Also, he remembers those who have died.

Clearly, we can believe in Jehovah’s promise of a future resurrection because we know that he has both the desire and the power to fulfill it. Consider another reason for believing in God’s promise of a resurrection: Jehovah has already done it. In Bible times, he empowered a handful of faithful men, including Jesus, to raise the dead. <a class="xt" data-xtid="374" href="jwpub://p/E:2023361/13-15"><em>w23.04</em> 9-10 ¶7-9</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:26-40:18:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 18:26, 27</a>) Third, a patient person is not rash. When a patient person has an important task to accomplish, he does not rush into it; nor does he rush through it. Rather, he sets aside a reasonable amount of time to plan what he will do. Then he gives the task the time that it requires. Fourth, a patient person strives to bear trials without complaining. He does his best to continue enduring while maintaining a positive attitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:11-51:1:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Col. 1:11</a>) As Christians, we need to show all these facets of patience. <a class="xt" data-xtid="376" href="jwpub://p/E:2023527/9-12"><em>w23.08</em> 20-21 ¶3-6</a></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13">A key reason to protect our figurative heart is that Jehovah examines our heart. This means that he looks past what we appear to be to others and sees who we really are on the inside. He will love us if we fill our mind with his life-giving wisdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:14-43:4:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 4:14</a>) We will thereby leave no room for the moral and spiritual poison coming from Satan and his world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:18-62:5:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 John 5:18, 19</a>) As we draw closer to Jehovah, our love and respect for him will grow. Because we do not want to hurt our Father, we will hate even the very thought of sinning. Marta, a sister in Croatia who was tempted to commit immorality, wrote: “I found it hard to think clearly and to suppress the urge to enjoy the temporary pleasure of sin. But fear of Jehovah protected me.” How did fear of God do that? Marta said that she meditated on the consequences that a bad decision would bring.

No intelligent creature in the universe has ever done more to sanctify Jehovah’s name than Jesus has. Yet, when Jesus was arrested, what sin did his enemies accuse him of? Blasphemy! Jesus surely felt that to abuse or to slander his Father’s holy name was the most repugnant of sins. He was deeply disturbed that he would be charged and convicted of this crime.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:5:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32–5:1</a>) A couple who display such qualities make it easier for love to thrive.

When Jehovah had to choose a couple to be the parents of the future Messiah, He chose Joseph and Mary out of the many descendants of David. Why?

Would he quit, or would he persevere as Christ’s disciple? Jesus had supplicated Jehovah that Peter’s faith would not give out.

The Mosaic Law allowed for a man or a woman to make a special vow to Jehovah by choosing to live as a Nazirite for a period of time.

Daniel’s loyalty to Jehovah was tested throughout his life. But one of the greatest tests came when he was in his 90’s. Members of the royal court disliked Daniel and had little respect for the God he worshipped. So they devised a plot to have Daniel killed. They had a decree issued that would test whether Daniel would be loyal to his God or to the king. All Daniel had to do to prove his loyalty to the king was to stop praying to Jehovah for 30 days.

The blindfold of satanic lies gradually comes off, and these individuals begin to see our beloved Father as we do. They are filled with awe at his limitless power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) They are assured by his perfect justice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4</a>) They are enlightened by his profound wisdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) As they draw close to Jehovah, their hope of living forever as his children becomes sure. What a marvelous privilege we have to help people draw close to their Father! When we do so, Jehovah considers us his “fellow workers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:5-46:3:5" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="402" href="jwpub://p/E:2024281/24-24"><em>w24.02</em> 12 ¶15</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82">If you are a Bible student or if you are being raised by parents who are Witnesses, are you thinking about getting baptized? That is a commendable goal! Before getting baptized, though, you will need to dedicate yourself to Jehovah. How do you dedicate yourself to Jehovah? You promise him in prayer that you will worship only him and that you will put his will first in your life. Really, you are promising Jehovah that you will continue to love him “with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) Your dedication is made in private, between you and Jehovah. In contrast, baptism is public; it shows onlookers that you have made a dedication. Your dedication is a sacred vow, and Jehovah expects you to live up to it, just as you expect that of yourself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:4" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="403" href="jwpub://p/E:2024320/8-8"><em>w24.03</em> 2 ¶2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="404" href="jwpub://p/E:2024320/12-12"> 3 ¶5</a></p>

The Bible frankly acknowledges that married people will have “tribulation in their flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:28-46:7:28" data-bid="108-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:28</a>) Why? Because marriage brings two imperfect people together, each with different characteristics, likes, and dislikes. Mates may come from different cultures or backgrounds. They may, in time, display traits that were not noticeable before the wedding. Any of those things can cause friction. Instead of recognizing that each has a part in the problem and therefore should work to resolve it, they may blame their mate. They may even come to see separation or divorce as the solution. But is giving up on the marriage the answer? No. Jehovah directs that married people respect the marriage arrangement even if their mate is difficult to live with. <a class="xt" data-xtid="405" href="jwpub://p/E:2024322/16-16"><em>w24.03</em> 16 ¶8;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="406" href="jwpub://p/E:2024322/19-19"> 17 ¶11</a></p>

It affects you more intensely, influencing every aspect of your life and changing how you treat your family, how you make decisions, and even how you use your time.

We could feel as if we were being tossed from one strong emotion to the next. How does Jehovah help us when such emotions begin flooding over us? He assures us that he will stabilize us. When a ship encounters a storm, it may begin to rock dangerously from side to side. To counteract this movement, many ships have stabilizers that extend from each side of the ship under the water. These stabilizers can significantly reduce the rocking of the ship, making the situation safer and more bearable for passengers. However, many stabilization systems work best when the ship is moving forward. Similarly, Jehovah will stabilize us as we move forward faithfully in times of trial. <a class="xt" data-xtid="408" href="jwpub://p/E:2024245/15-16"><em>w24.01</em> 22 ¶7-8</a></p>
