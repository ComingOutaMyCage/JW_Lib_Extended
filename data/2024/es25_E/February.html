If you have children, as did Joseph and Mary, it may be challenging to attend meetings or to schedule time for family worship. It may be even harder to coordinate time to study or pray together as a couple. Yet, remember that when you worship Jehovah together, you draw closer to him and to each other.

Because Christians had no impressive temple to go to for worship, no physical altar on which to make sacrifices to God, and no priests to minister to them.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:1-13:29:5" data-bid="100-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:1-5</a>) Immediately after informing David that he would not be the one to build the temple, Jehovah made a covenant with him. Jehovah promised David that one of his descendants would rule forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:16-10:7:16" data-bid="101-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:16</a>) In the new world, imagine how happy David will be to learn that he is enjoying life under the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus, a King from his own family line! This account helps us to see that even if we cannot do all that we had hoped to do for Jehovah, our God may have other blessings in store for us that we could never have anticipated. <a class="xt" data-xtid="60" href="jwpub://p/E:2023364/14-16"><em>w23.04</em> 16 ¶8-10</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79">You may find that specific portions of the Bible can be particularly comforting when you are afraid. For example, you may find encouragement in the books of Job, Psalms, and Proverbs as well as in Jesus’ words found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:1-40:6:34" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 6</a>. As you pray to Jehovah and read his Word, you will feel his comfort. We can have confidence that Jehovah will be there for us during dark times in our life. We will never be alone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:4-19:23:4" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Ps. 23:4</a>) Jehovah promises to guard, stabilize, support, and comfort us. Regarding Jehovah, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:3-23:26:3" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:3</a> says: “You will safeguard those who fully lean on you; you will give them continuous peace, because it is in you that they trust.” So trust in Jehovah, and take advantage of the means he uses to help you. If you do, you will regain strength even during difficult times. <a class="xt" data-xtid="61" href="jwpub://p/E:2024245/26-27"><em>w24.01</em> 25 ¶16-17</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85">As Christians, we take our dedication vow to Jehovah seriously. This affects our decisions and actions regarding family matters. We diligently care for our Scriptural family responsibilities, but we never put the desires of our family members ahead of what Jehovah requires of us.
