Whatever the case, Delilah repeatedly pressured Samson to reveal the source of his strength, and he ultimately gave in to her demands. Sadly, Samson allowed himself to get into a situation that led to the loss of his strength and the loss of Jehovah’s approval for a time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:16-7:16:20" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Judg. 16:16-20</a>) Samson experienced painful consequences because of trusting Delilah rather than Jehovah. The Philistines captured and blinded Samson. He was imprisoned in Gaza, and he became a lowly grinder of grain. Then he was humiliated when the Philistines gathered for a celebration. They offered a great sacrifice to their false god Dagon, as if he had given Samson into their hands. They brought Samson from prison to the party to provide “some amusement”​—to make fun of him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:21-7:16:25" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Judg. 16:21-25</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="83" href="jwpub://p/E:2023560/21-22"><em>w23.09</em> 5-6 ¶13-14</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) It is often helpful to view the question as a way to learn what he cares about rather than as an attack or a challenge. Regardless of the reason why someone has raised an issue, we do well to respond in a gentle, kind way. Our answer may then move him to reconsider his viewpoint. If a workmate asks, for example, why we do not celebrate birthdays, consider: Could he be wondering whether we are allowed to have a good time? We may be able to ease our workmate’s concerns by expressing how much we appreciate his interest in fellow workers. That might open the way to a relaxed conversation about what the Bible indicates regarding the subject of birthdays. <a class="xt" data-xtid="84" href="jwpub://p/E:2023564/17-18"><em>w23.09</em> 17 ¶10-11</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82">Before Israel entered the Promised Land, Moses died. Without that faithful man, were God’s people left in the lurch? No. As long as they were faithful, Jehovah provided for them. Before Moses died, Jehovah told him to commission Joshua to lead the people. Moses had been training Joshua for decades. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:11-2:33:11" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ex. 33:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:9-5:34:9" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> Deut. 34:9</a>) In addition, there were many other capable men taking the lead​—chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and even tens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:15-5:1:15" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Deut. 1:15</a>) God’s people were well cared for. We find a similar example in Elijah. He had been taking the lead in pure worship among the Israelites for decades. But the time came when Jehovah transferred him to a different assignment, down south in Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:2:1-12:2:1" data-bid="96-1" class="b">2 Ki. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:12-14:21:12" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 21:12</a>) Were faithful people in the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel abandoned? No. Elijah had been training Elisha for years. Jehovah’s purpose kept advancing, and he cared for his faithful worshippers. <a class="xt" data-xtid="98" href="jwpub://p/E:2024280/21-21"><em>w24.02</em> 5 ¶12</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85">The Ephesian Christians had embraced the light of Scriptural truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) These Ephesians had abandoned their false religious practices and immoral conduct. They had “become imitators of God” and were doing their best to worship Jehovah and to please him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1</a>) In a similar way, before we learned the truth, we were in religious and moral darkness. Some of us celebrated false religious holidays; others of us pursued an immoral lifestyle. But once we learned about Jehovah’s standards of right and wrong, we made changes. We began to bring our life into harmony with his righteous requirements. And as a result, we have enjoyed many benefits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17</a>) Now, though, we face ongoing challenges.

<p id="p94" data-pid="94">After Gideon was appointed as judge, his obedience and courage were tested. He was given the dangerous assignment to destroy his father’s Baal altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:25-7:6:26" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Judg. 6:25, 26</a>) Later, after gathering an army, Gideon was twice directed to reduce its size. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:2-7:7:7" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Judg. 7:2-7</a>) Finally, he was told to attack the enemy camp in the dead of night. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:9-7:7:11" data-bid="115-1" class="b">Judg. 7:9-11</a>) Elders should be “ready to obey.” An obedient elder readily submits to what the Scriptures say and to direction from God’s organization. He thus sets a good example for others. Still, his obedience may be tested. He may, for instance, find it hard to keep up with the direction he receives. In some cases, he may wonder whether certain direction is really practical or wise. Or he may be asked to take on an assignment that could put his freedom at risk. How can elders imitate Gideon’s obedience in such situations? Listen carefully to direction and apply it. <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:2023440/16-18"><em>w23.06</em> 4-5 ¶9-11</a></p>
