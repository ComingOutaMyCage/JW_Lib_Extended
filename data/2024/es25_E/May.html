And what about young people who had been planning to expand their ministry? Might they have felt that they should delay those plans? Regardless of their circumstances, the Christians adapted. They continued to preach in any way that they could, and they gladly shared their material belongings with fellow believers in Judea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:29-44:11:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 11:29, 30</a>) Those who received relief supplies saw Jehovah’s support firsthand. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:31-33</a>) They must have felt closer to their fellow believers who had come to their assistance.

Our prayers are not usually answered in spectacular ways. But the answers we do receive are just what we need to remain loyal to our heavenly Father. So be on the lookout for Jehovah’s answers to your prayers. From time to time, pause and reflect on how Jehovah is answering your prayers.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43">Some of Jehovah’s servants have been waiting for the end of this system of things for a long time. From a human standpoint, the fulfillment of God’s promise might seem to be delaying. Jehovah addressed that concern when he assured the prophet Habakkuk: “The vision is yet for its appointed time, and it is rushing toward its end, and it will not lie. Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it! For it will without fail come true. It will not be late!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Hab. 2:3</a>) Did God provide that assurance for the benefit of Habakkuk only? Or do His words have meaning for us today? Under inspiration, the apostle Paul applied those words to Christians, who are in expectation of the new world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:37-58:10:37" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Heb. 10:37</a>) Yes, we can be sure that even if our promised deliverance seems to delay, “it will without fail come true.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79">“The former heaven” refers to political governments influenced by Satan and his demons.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:1" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Gen. 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:1" data-bid="99-2" class="b"> Ps. 96:1</a>) Thus, “the former earth” refers to today’s wicked human society. Jehovah will not merely remodel, or fix up, the existing “heaven” and “earth”; rather, he will make a clean sweep by replacing them. He will replace the present heaven and the present earth with “a new heaven and a new earth”​—that is, a new government and a new human society. Jehovah will make the earth and humans like new by bringing them to a state of perfection. As Isaiah foretold, the entire earth will be made into a gardenlike park​—a global Eden. We will also be made new, or experience restoration, on a personal level. The lame, the blind, and the deaf will be healed, and even the dead will be restored to life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:8-23:25:8" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Isa. 25:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:7" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 35:1-7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="166" href="jwpub://p/E:2023640/17-18"><em>w23.11</em> 4 ¶9-10</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:3-45:16:4" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Rom. 16:3, 4</a>) They worked, preached, and helped others together.

How can couples imitate them? Think about the many things that you and your spouse need to do. Could you handle some of these tasks as a couple instead of individually? For example, Aquila and Priscilla preached together. Do you regularly make plans to do the same? Aquila and Priscilla also worked together. You and your spouse may not have the same job, but could you do household chores together? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:9-21:4:9" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Eccl. 4:9</a>) When you help each other perform a task, you feel more like a team and you have the opportunity to talk. <a class="xt" data-xtid="168" href="jwpub://p/E:2023405/17-19"><em>w23.05</em> 22-23 ¶10-12</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88">Everyone feels afraid at times. For instance, when King Saul was trying to hunt David down, David decided to flee to the Philistine city of Gath. The king of Gath, Achish, soon learned that David was the mighty warrior who was celebrated in song as having struck down “tens of thousands” of Philistines. David “became very much afraid.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:10-9:21:12" data-bid="111-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:10-12</a>) He worried about what Achish would do to him. How did David conquer his fears? In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:0-19:56:13" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Psalm 56</a>, David expresses his feelings while he was in Gath. That psalm lays bare David’s fears, but it also reveals how he conquered those fears. When he felt afraid, David trusted in Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:1-19:56:3" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Ps. 56:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:11-19:56:11" data-bid="113-2" class="b"> 11</a>) His trust was not misplaced. With Jehovah’s blessing, David devised an unusual but effective strategy: He pretended to be crazy! Achish now viewed David more as an irritant than a threat, so David was able to escape.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:13-9:22:1" data-bid="114-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:13–22:1</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="169" href="jwpub://p/E:2024240/7-9"><em>w24.01</em> 2 ¶1-3</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91">Who are the ones mentioned in today’s text? The resurrected anointed ones! So when the last of the anointed on earth are taken to heaven near the end of the great tribulation, one of their first assignments will be to fight. After being raised to heaven, they will serve along with Christ and his holy angels, waging the final war against God’s enemies. Think of it! On earth, some anointed Christians are elderly, even frail. But once resurrected to life in heaven, they will be mighty and immortal spirit creatures, assigned to fight alongside their Warrior-King, Jesus Christ. After the war of Armageddon has been fought, they will share in guiding mankind to perfection. Without a doubt, they will then do their beloved brothers and sisters on earth a lot more good in heaven than they ever could as mere imperfect humans! <a class="xt" data-xtid="170" href="jwpub://p/E:2024280/24-25"><em>w24.02</em> 6-7 ¶15-16</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:14" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14</a>) However, whether you act on temptation is a choice​—your choice. The fact is that ultimately you are the one who is in control of how you will live. Though some people may make claims to the contrary, you can learn to control your impulses. <a class="xt" data-xtid="171" href="jwpub://p/E:2024320/21-22"><em>w24.03</em> 5 ¶11-12</a></p>
