One way is by helping us to have a realistic view of life in this system of things. While Jehovah does promise that we will have joy in serving him, he does not guarantee a worry-free life now. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:14-23:66:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 66:14</a>) He urges us to focus on our future​—the time when we will have the life that he wants us to enjoy forever.

Augustus, who ruled the Roman Empire, called for a census. Joseph and Mary had to travel to Bethlehem, a journey of up to 150 kilometers (93 mi) through hilly country. That trip would be uncomfortable, especially for Mary. The couple may have worried about her safety and that of their unborn baby. What if she were to go into labor while traveling? She was carrying the future Messiah in her womb. Would that excuse them from obeying the government? Joseph and Mary did not allow any of those concerns to influence whether they would obey the law. Jehovah blessed their obedience. Mary arrived safely in Bethlehem, gave birth to a healthy baby, and even helped to fulfill Bible prophecy!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="241" href="jwpub://p/E:2023601/16-16"><em>w23.10</em> 8 ¶9;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="242" href="jwpub://p/E:2023601/18-19"> 9 ¶11-12</a></p>

In 36 C.E., Peter was present when the uncircumcised Gentile Cornelius was anointed with holy spirit, which was clear evidence that “God is not partial” and that Gentiles could be part of the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:34" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Acts 10:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:44-44:10:45" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 44, 45</a>) Peter thereafter felt free to share meals with Gentiles, something he would never have done earlier. However, some Jewish Christians felt that Jews and Gentiles should not eat together. When some who had that viewpoint came to Antioch, Peter stopped eating with his Gentile brothers, likely out of fear of offending Jewish Christians. The apostle Paul saw this hypocrisy and rebuked Peter publicly.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79">Patience helps us in our dealings with others. It helps us to listen attentively when others speak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Jas. 1:19</a>) Patience also promotes peace. It protects us from reacting too quickly and saying something unkind when we are under stress. And if we are patient, we will be slow to anger when someone hurts our feelings. Instead of retaliating, we will “continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:13" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Col. 3:12, 13</a>) Patience can also help us to make better decisions. Instead of being hasty or impulsive, we will take the time to research and evaluate the options that we have. For example, if we are looking for work, we might be inclined to accept the first offer we receive. However, if we are patient, we will take the time to consider the impact the job could have on our family and spiritual life. By being patient, we may avoid making a bad decision. <a class="xt" data-xtid="269" href="jwpub://p/E:2023527/15-16"><em>w23.08</em> 22 ¶8-9</a></p>

How? When you make a dedication to Jehovah, you disown yourself. This means that you say no to personal desires and ambitions that would displease Jehovah.

You will have already shut the door on all options except one​—faithfulness to Jehovah. You will remain firmly resolved to please Jehovah. You will in that sense be like Job.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:5-2:34:7" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Ex. 34:5-7</a>) Jesus made that truth clearer than ever when he related the parable of the wayward son and his father. When we read about that father catching sight of his repentant son “while he was still a long way off,” running to meet him, embracing him, and forgiving him wholeheartedly, we see a most vivid picture of Jehovah’s mercy and compassion.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91">Jehovah brings refreshment and comfort to those who are distressed. How can we imitate Jehovah in feeling compassion and in providing comfort to others? One way we can do so is by cultivating qualities in our heart that are related to giving comfort. What are some of these qualities? What will help us to maintain the love that we need in order to “keep comforting one another” from day to day? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:18-52:4:18" data-bid="116-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:18</a>) We need to cultivate such tender qualities as fellow feeling, brotherly affection, and kindness.

When feelings of compassion and related qualities become part of our personality, we cannot help but give comfort to those in distress. As Jesus stated, “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:34-40:12:35" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34, 35</a>) Giving comfort to our brothers and sisters in need is truly an important way in which we express our love to them. <a class="xt" data-xtid="273" href="jwpub://p/E:2023641/17-18"><em>w23.11</em> 10 ¶10-11</a></p>
