(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:7-55:4:8" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:7, 8</a>) We need to make every effort to keep on running, especially because the finish line is closer than ever. The apostle Paul identified what will help us to win the race. He directed us to “throw off every weight and . . . run with endurance the race that is set before us.” Did Paul mean that there was no load a Christian should carry? No, that was not his point. Rather, he meant that we need to get rid of every unnecessary weight. This type of weight could hinder us and cause us to tire out. To endure, we must quickly identify and discard any unnecessary weight that could slow us down. At the same time, however, we do not want to cast aside loads that we should carry. Otherwise, we could disqualify ourselves from the race.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:5-55:2:5" data-bid="53-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="354" href="jwpub://p/E:2023528/6-7"><em>w23.08</em> 26 ¶1-2</a></p>

The inhabitants of a guarded city slept in peace, knowing that troops were posted at the gates. Similarly, when the peace of God guards our hearts and minds, we feel calm, knowing that we are safe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:4:8-19:4:8" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Ps. 4:8</a>) As in the case of Hannah, even if our situation does not change immediately, we can still feel a measure of peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:16-9:1:18" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:16-18</a>) And when we feel calm, we often find it easier to think clearly and make wise decisions. What can we do? When you are troubled, summon the guard, so to speak. How? Pray until you feel the peace of God.

When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah, you choose to become a disciple of Jesus Christ and make the doing of God’s will the most important thing in your life. What will Christian dedication require of you? Jesus said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Matt. 16:24</a>) The Greek phrase translated “let him disown himself” can also be rendered “he must say no to himself.” As a dedicated servant of Jehovah, you will need to say no to anything that conflicts with his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="111-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>) That includes saying no to “the works of the flesh,” such as sexual immorality.

Actually, the more you learn to display the fruitage of God’s spirit, the more evident it will be to you that you have Jehovah’s approval!
