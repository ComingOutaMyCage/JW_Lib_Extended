He was commanded by his father to take a wife from the daughters of Laban, a believing relative, and was assured that Jehovah would bless him richly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:1-1:28:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 28:1-4</a>) So Jacob did the right thing. He left the land of Canaan and journeyed to the home of Laban, who had two daughters​—Leah and Rachel. Jacob fell in love with Laban’s younger daughter, Rachel, and agreed to work seven years for her father before marrying her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:18-1:29:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 29:18</a>) But matters did not turn out as Jacob had hoped. Laban tricked him into marrying his older daughter, Leah. Laban allowed Jacob to marry Rachel a week later, but only if he worked seven more years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:26-1:29:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 29:26, 27</a>) Laban was also unfair in his business dealings with Jacob.

Jehoiada was loyal to Jehovah and did not tremble in fear of Athaliah. When Jehoash was seven years old, Jehoiada again proved his loyalty to Jehovah. He formed a plan. If it succeeded, Jehoash would become king, David’s rightful heir. If the plan failed, however, Jehoiada would almost certainly lose his life.

What can help? Think about how Jehovah feels.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:43-2:29:46" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Ex. 29:43-46</a>) However, the tabernacle also represented something much greater. It was “a shadow of the heavenly things,” and it pictured Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. The apostle Paul said that “this tent [or, tabernacle] is an illustration for the present time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:9-58:9:9" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Heb. 9:9</a>) So by the time he wrote to the Hebrews, the spiritual temple had already become a reality for Christians. It came into existence in 29 C.E. That year, Jesus got baptized and began serving as Jehovah’s “great high priest” in the spiritual temple.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:14-58:4:14" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Heb. 4:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:37-44:10:38" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> Acts 10:37, 38</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="128" href="jwpub://p/E:2023606/12-13"><em>w23.10</em> 25-26 ¶6-7</a></p>

We must be reasonable by adapting when our personal circumstances change and by respecting the viewpoints and decisions of others. As Jehovah’s servants, we want to be reasonable. We also want to be humble and compassionate. Jehovah is called “the Rock” because he is steadfast, immovable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4</a>) However, he is also reasonable. As events unfold, our God continues to adapt in order to cause his purpose to be realized. Jehovah created humans in his image with the ability to adjust to changing circumstances. He provided clear Bible principles that help us to make wise decisions no matter what challenges we may face. Jehovah’s own example and the principles he has given us are evidence that while being “the Rock,” Jehovah is also reasonable. <a class="xt" data-xtid="129" href="jwpub://p/E:2023486/6-9"><em>w23.07</em> 20 ¶1-3</a></p>
