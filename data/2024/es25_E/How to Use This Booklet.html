<p id="p2" data-pid="2">In this booklet, you will find a scripture and comments for each day. Although the text and comments may be read at any time, many find it advantageous to consider them in the morning. Then they can reflect on such thoughts throughout the day. Discussing the text as a family is most beneficial. Bethel families around the world do so at breakfast time.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3">The comments are taken from the <em>Watchtower</em> (<em>w</em>) issues of April 2023 through March 2024. Figures following the date of the <em>Watchtower</em> issue refer first to the page(s) in that issue and then to the paragraph(s) where the material is found. (See illustration below.) Additional information on the subject matter can be found in the article itself.</p>
