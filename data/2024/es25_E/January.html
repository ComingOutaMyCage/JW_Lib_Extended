A number of brothers and sisters have voiced this concern, especially when going through a difficult time.

The more we pray, the more real Jehovah becomes to us. Each time we ask him for strength to endure a trial, we are reminded of his awesome power. When we thank him for the gift of his Son, we remind ourselves of Jehovah’s love for us. And when we supplicate Jehovah for his help with a problem, we impress on our heart just how wise he is.

One way we can develop faith like that of Abraham is by studying his example.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79">Picture the scene in late 29 C.E. at the start of Jesus’ ministry. Jesus and his mother, Mary, are invited to a wedding feast in Cana. Mary is apparently helping to care for the guests. But during the wedding feast, a problem arises​—the wine runs out. Mary quickly turns to her son and says: “They have no wine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:1-43:2:3" data-bid="96-1" class="b">John 2:1-3</a>) What does Jesus do? He miraculously turns water into “fine wine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:9-43:2:10" data-bid="97-1" class="b">John 2:9, 10</a>) Jesus would go on to perform many other miracles during his ministry. He used his miraculous power to help tens of thousands of people. For example, just two of his miracles​—feeding 5,000 men and later 4,000 men—​may have involved a total of over 27,000 people if we include the women and children who were also present.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:5-11:19:7" data-bid="101-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:5-7</a>) We may need help to keep active in Jehovah’s service. In those moments, Jehovah assures us of his help as expressed in the words of today’s text. King David experienced this help. When faced with trials and enemies, he said to Jehovah: “Your right hand supports me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:35-19:18:35" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps. 18:35</a>) Jehovah often supports us by motivating others to help us. For example, once when David felt weak, his friend Jonathan visited him to provide emotional support and words of encouragement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:16-9:23:17" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Sam. 23:16, 17</a>) Similarly, Jehovah chose Elisha to provide practical help to Elijah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:16-11:19:16" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:21-11:19:21" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:2:2-12:2:2" data-bid="104-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 2:2</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="30" href="jwpub://p/E:2024245/19-21"><em>w24.01</em> 23-24 ¶10-12</a></p>

The account mentions that this figurative woman has fully prepared her meat, mixed her wine, and arranged her table in her house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:2-20:9:2" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Prov. 9:2</a>, ftn.)

Jehovah wants his children to be wise and safe. He does not want us to learn life’s lessons the hard way​—through bitter experience and with nagging regrets. That is why “he treasures up practical wisdom for the upright.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:7-20:2:7" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Prov. 2:7</a>) When we have a healthy fear of Jehovah, we will want to please him.

In Zechariah’s day, Jehovah asked his prophet to make a crown out of the gold and the silver sent by the exiles in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:11-38:6:11" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Zech. 6:11</a>) This “grand crown” would serve as a “reminder” of their generous contributions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:14-38:6:14" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Zech. 6:14</a>, ftns.) We can be confident that Jehovah will never forget our earnest efforts to serve him during uncertain times.

He wants us to persevere​—to keep trying—​despite our weaknesses. Why is it necessary for us to persevere? After we feel that we have overcome a certain weakness, we may suffer a setback. But we still keep working toward our goal. We all say or do things that we later regret; nonetheless, if we refuse to give up, Jehovah will help us to keep making progress.
