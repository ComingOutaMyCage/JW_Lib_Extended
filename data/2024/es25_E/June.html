<p id="p4" data-pid="4">Jehovah blessed the first-century Christians as they adapted to changing circumstances. They were often persecuted, sometimes when they may have least expected it. Consider what happened to Barnabas and the apostle Paul while they were preaching in the area of Lystra. At first, they were warmly received by those who listened to them. But later, opposers “persuaded the crowds,” and some of those same people stoned Paul and left him for dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 14:19</a>) But Barnabas and Paul continued preaching elsewhere. The results? They made “quite a few disciples,” and their words and example strengthened their fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:21-44:14:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 14:21, 22</a>) Many benefited because Barnabas and Paul did not give up in the face of sudden persecution. As long as we do not give up in the work Jehovah has asked us to do, we will be blessed. <a class="xt" data-xtid="172" href="jwpub://p/E:2023364/19-20"><em>w23.04</em> 16-17 ¶13-14</a></p>

Because the common people, pictured by the soft clay, undermine its ability to act with ironlike strength. From Daniel’s description of the dream image, we learn several important truths. First, the Anglo-American World Power has shown its strength in some ways. For example, it played a key role in winning World War I and World War II. However, this world power has been weakened and will continue to be weakened by internal conflicts among its own citizens.

Peter and his brother Andrew later abandoned their fishing business and became full-time followers of the Messiah, a decision that led to remarkable blessings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:16-41:1:18" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Mark 1:16-18</a>) Peter had many wonderful experiences as a follower of Christ.

At the time, Peter likely believed that he was being generous when he suggested that he would forgive his brother “up to seven times.” But Jesus taught him​—and us—​to forgive “up to 77 times,” meaning without limit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:21-40:18:21" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Matt. 18:21</a>) If you have found it hard to apply this counsel, take heart!

We could even be facing death because of a medical problem. During such times, we may feel as helpless as a small child. How does Jehovah help us in moments like these? He comforts and soothes us. So regularly spend time with Jehovah​—praying to him and reading his Word.

Share your fears and concerns with Jehovah. Let him talk to you and console you through the Scriptures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:28-19:119:28" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Ps. 119:28</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="200" href="jwpub://p/E:2024245/24-26"><em>w24.01</em> 24-25 ¶14-16</a></p>

And the more motivated we are, the more likely we are to reach our goals. So, what can you do to feel more motivated? Pray for more motivation. By means of his spirit, Jehovah can motivate you to reach your goal. Sometimes we set a goal because we know we should, and that is a good thing. But we may not really have the desire to reach it. Meditate on what Jehovah has done for you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:5-19:143:5" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Ps. 143:5</a>) The apostle Paul meditated on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness toward him, and this motivated him to work hard for Jehovah.

No. When we praise our heavenly Father, we help to refute a lie that involves us personally. Satan claims that no human will loyally defend God’s name. None of us have integrity, according to him.
