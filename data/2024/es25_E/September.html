For example, he has the power to free us from the root cause of mankind’s problems​—inherited sin and its effects, sickness and death.

Prepare several comments for each meeting. Then if you are not chosen to comment early in the study, you will still have opportunities to comment as the meeting progresses. When preparing for the <em>Watchtower</em> Study, think about how each paragraph ties in to the theme of the article. If you do, you will likely have something to offer throughout the lesson. Additionally, you might prepare to comment on paragraphs that discuss deeper truths that are more difficult to explain. Why? Because there may be fewer volunteers during that part of the lesson. What if you find that after several meetings you still have not had an opportunity to comment?

Pioneering may open the door to other forms of full-time service, including serving as a construction servant or a Bethelite. Christian men should have the goal of qualifying to serve their brothers and sisters as congregation elders.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43">When deciding whether to buy a house, you would want to examine all the aspects of your future home in person. We can do something similar when we read and study the Bible. If you just read it quickly, you may learn only basic facts​—“the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:12-58:5:12" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12</a>) Instead, as with the house, go “inside” to examine the rich details. An excellent way to study the Bible is to see how the various parts of its message connect together. Endeavor to understand not only what truths you believe but also why you believe them. To understand God’s Word fully, we must learn deep Bible truths. The apostle Paul urged his Christian brothers and sisters to study God’s Word diligently so that they could “comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth” of the truth. Then they would become further “rooted and established” in their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:19" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Eph. 3:14-19</a>) We need to do the same. <a class="xt" data-xtid="288" href="jwpub://p/E:2023605/6-8"><em>w23.10</em> 18 ¶1-3</a></p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58">We all want to “continue loving one another.” However, it is important for us to remember that Jesus warned that “the love of the greater number [would] grow cold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Matt. 24:12</a>) Jesus was not saying that this would occur on a large scale among his disciples. Nonetheless, we should remain alert so that we are not influenced by the lack of love in the world around us. With that thought in mind, let us consider this important question: Is there a way to test whether our love for our brothers is strong? One way to determine the strength of our love is to examine how we handle certain situations in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:8-47:8:8" data-bid="61-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:8</a>) One such situation is mentioned by the apostle Peter: “Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="62-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>) So the weaknesses and imperfections of others can put our love to the test. <a class="xt" data-xtid="293" href="jwpub://p/E:2023641/20-21"><em>w23.11</em> 10-11 ¶12-13</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="65-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:17</a>) Peter urged us to “love one another intensely from the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="66-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:22</a>) In this context, to love “intensely” involves stretching the limits of our natural inclination to love.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82">Notice the expression “poured out” in the text above. One reference work describes it as “come upon us like a stream.” What a powerful image to highlight the abundance of Jehovah’s love for the anointed! The anointed know that they are “loved by God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:1-65:1:1" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Jude 1</a>) The apostle John expressed their feelings when he wrote: “See what sort of love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:1-62:3:1" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 John 3:1</a>) Is Jehovah’s love limited to the anointed? No, Jehovah has proved his love for all of us. What is the greatest confirmation of Jehovah’s love?

David knew that Jehovah would rescue him at the right time. After all, Jehovah had declared that David would be the next king of Israel.

What has Jehovah promised to do for you? We do not expect him to shield us from all problems. Still, whatever trials you may face in this system of things, Jehovah will do away with them in the coming new world.

Think back to what helped you to become convinced that you had found the truth. You took in accurate knowledge of Jehovah and grew to respect and love him as your heavenly Father. You developed faith and were motivated to repent. Your heart moved you to abandon wrong practices and to live in harmony with God’s will. You felt relief when you sensed God’s forgiveness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:2-19:32:2" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Ps. 32:2</a>) You attended Christian meetings and began to share with others the wonderful things you had learned.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91">By reflecting on your prayer of dedication to Jehovah, you will find the strength to resist any temptation. For example, would you start flirting with another person’s mate? Certainly not! You will have already said no to that. You will thus spare yourself the anguish of having to deal with improper feelings after they have taken root. You will “turn away” from “the path of the wicked.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:14-20:4:15" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Prov. 4:14, 15</a>) Recalling Jesus’ determination to please his Father, you will quickly and firmly reject anything that you know would displease the God to whom you are dedicated.

As you do, you can be assured that Jehovah will help you. <a class="xt" data-xtid="306" href="jwpub://p/E:2024321/15-17"><em>w24.03</em> 9-10 ¶8-10</a></p>
