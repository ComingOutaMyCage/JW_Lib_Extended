By remembering that others, like us, want to participate. Think about it this way. When you are having a conversation with your friends, would you talk so much that they have little opportunity to speak? Of course not! You want them to share in the conversation. Similarly, at meetings, we want to allow as many as possible to comment. In fact, one of the best ways to encourage our brothers and sisters is by giving them a chance to express their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:24</a>) So keep our comments brief, thus allowing time for more to participate.

In the minds of faithful Jews, the benefits of returning to Israel far outweighed any sacrifices they would make. The greatest blessing involved their worship. There was no temple of Jehovah in Babylon. There was no altar where the Israelites could offer up the sacrifices required by the Mosaic Law, and there was no organized priesthood to offer those sacrifices. In addition, Jehovah’s people were greatly outnumbered by pagan men and women, who had no regard for Jehovah or his standards. So God-fearing Jews​—thousands of them—​were looking forward to returning to their homeland where they could restore pure worship. <a class="xt" data-xtid="323" href="jwpub://p/E:2023404/8-9"><em>w23.05</em> 14-15 ¶3-4</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82">Jehovah expects a husband to love his wife and to care for her physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Developing thinking ability, having respect for women, and being reliable, will help you as a marriage mate. After you have married, you may become a father. What can you learn from Jehovah about being a good father? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>) Jehovah openly told his Son, Jesus, that he loved him and approved of him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:17-40:3:17" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 3:17</a>) If you become a father, make sure that you regularly assure your children that you love them. Generously commend them for the good things that they do. Fathers who imitate Jehovah’s example help their children to develop into mature Christian men and women. You can prepare now for this role by lovingly caring for others in your family and in the congregation and by learning to express your love and appreciation for them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:9-43:15:9" data-bid="102-1" class="b">John 15:9</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="334" href="jwpub://p/E:2023686/25-26"><em>w23.12</em> 28-29 ¶17-18</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85">As faithful servants of Jehovah, we face difficulties and infirmities that are common to all mankind. We may also have to endure opposition or persecution from those who hate God’s people. Though Jehovah does not shield us from such hardships, he does promise to help us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Isa. 41:10</a>) With his assistance, we can maintain our joy, make good decisions, and stay loyal to him even through the most difficult situations. Jehovah promises to give us what the Bible calls “the peace of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) This peace refers to the calmness and tranquility of mind and heart that result from our precious relationship with him. This peace “surpasses all understanding”; it is more wonderful than we can imagine. Have you ever felt surprisingly calm after praying fervently to Jehovah? That feeling is “the peace of God.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="335" href="jwpub://p/E:2024245/8-8"><em>w24.01</em> 20 ¶2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="336" href="jwpub://p/E:2024245/11-11"> 21 ¶4</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88">Love for God moves faithful people to praise his name wholeheartedly. King David understood that to praise Jehovah’s name is to praise Jehovah himself. Jehovah’s name involves his reputation, so it brings to mind all his beautiful qualities and his marvelous deeds. David wanted to treat his Father’s name as holy and to praise it. He wanted to do so with “everything within” him​—that is, wholeheartedly. Similarly, the Levites took the lead in praising Jehovah. They humbly admitted that their words could never fully express the praise that Jehovah’s sacred name deserves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:5-16:9:5" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Neh. 9:5</a>) Without a doubt, such humble, heartfelt praise brought joy to Jehovah’s heart. <a class="xt" data-xtid="337" href="jwpub://p/E:2024281/13-13"><em>w24.02</em> 9 ¶6</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:12-47:8:12" data-bid="109-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:12</a>) View the setback as a learning experience. Keep in mind what you have already achieved. The Bible says that “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) So neither should you forget. Reflect on what you have already accomplished​—be it developing a friendship with Jehovah, speaking to others about him, or getting baptized. Just as you have progressed and reached spiritual goals in the past, you can continue to progress toward your current goal. With Jehovah’s help, you can reach your goal. As you continue working toward your spiritual goal, do not forget to enjoy seeing how Jehovah helps and blesses you along the way.

<p id="p94" data-pid="94">Jehovah loves to express warm approval of those for whom he has affection. The Scriptures report two occasions when He told Jesus that he was His beloved, approved Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:17-40:3:17" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Matt. 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:5-40:17:5" data-bid="114-2" class="b"> 17:5</a>) Would you like to hear Jehovah reassure you of his approval? Jehovah does not speak to us audibly, but he speaks to us through the pages of his Word. We can “hear” Jehovah’s voice of approval when we read Jesus’ words in the Gospels. Jesus perfectly reflected his Father’s personality. So when we read that Jesus expressed his approval of his imperfect but faithful followers, we can picture Jehovah saying those words to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:9-43:15:9" data-bid="115-1" class="b">John 15:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:15-43:15:15" data-bid="115-2" class="b"> 15</a>) If trials occur, they do not mean that we have lost God’s approval. Rather, they provide us with opportunities to prove the depth of our love for God and our trust in him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:12-59:1:12" data-bid="116-1" class="b">Jas. 1:12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="339" href="jwpub://p/E:2024326/18-19"><em>w24.03</em> 28 ¶10-11</a></p>
