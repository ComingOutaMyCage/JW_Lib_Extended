We must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations.​—Acts 14:22.



Jehovah blessed the first-century Christians as they adapted to changing circumstances. They were often persecuted, sometimes when they may have least expected it. Consider what happened to Barnabas and the apostle Paul while they were preaching in the area of Lystra. At first, they were warmly received by those who listened to them. But later, opposers “persuaded the crowds,” and some of those same people stoned Paul and left him for dead. (Acts 14:19) But Barnabas and Paul continued preaching elsewhere. The results? They made “quite a few disciples,” and their words and example strengthened their fellow believers. (Acts 14:21, 22) Many benefited because Barnabas and Paul did not give up in the face of sudden persecution. As long as we do not give up in the work Jehovah has asked us to do, we will be blessed. w23.04 16-17 ¶13-14




Monday, June 2

Listen, O Jehovah, to my prayer; and pay attention to my pleas for help. I call on you in the day of my distress, for you will answer me.​—Ps. 86:6, 7.



King David faced many dangerous enemies throughout his life, and he often sought Jehovah’s help in prayer. David was sure that Jehovah heard and answered his prayers. You can have that same confidence. The Bible assures us that Jehovah can give us the wisdom and the power we need to endure. He may use our spiritual family or even those who do not worship him at present to help us in some way. While Jehovah may not always answer our prayers in the way that we expect, we know that he will answer them. He will provide just what we need and exactly when we need it. So continue to pray in faith, confident that Jehovah will care for you now and that he will “satisfy the desire of every living thing” in the new world to come.​—Ps. 145:16. w23.05 8 ¶4; 13 ¶17-18




Tuesday, June 3

With what will I repay Jehovah for all the good he has done for me?​—Ps. 116:12.



It is good to focus on the blessings received when reaching a goal. What blessings could you focus on? If your goal relates to Bible reading or prayer, think about how it will strengthen your friendship with Jehovah. (Ps. 145:18, 19) If your goal is to cultivate a Christian quality, focus on how it will improve your relationships with others. (Col. 3:14) Why not make a list of all the reasons why you want to reach your goal? Regularly consult that list. Also, spend time with those who will motivate you. (Prov. 13:20) Realistically, though, we all have days when we do not feel motivated. Does this mean that we cannot work on our goal? No. We can still work toward our goal even when we are not motivated. Though this will require self-discipline, the results are worthwhile. w23.05 27-28 ¶5-8

Whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap.​—Gal. 6:7.



Knowing that we are accountable for our decisions can prompt us to confess our sins, correct our errors, and avoid repeating our mistakes. Taking such actions can help us to stay in the race for life. If you cannot undo a poor decision, accept your current situation. Do not waste your emotional and mental energy justifying yourself or blaming yourself or others. Instead, acknowledge your mistakes and work to make the best of your present circumstances. If you feel guilty about a wrong you committed, humbly turn to Jehovah in prayer, admit your error, and ask him to forgive you. (Ps. 25:11; 51:3, 4) Apologize to those you may have wronged, and if necessary, seek the help of the elders. (Jas. 5:14, 15) Learn from your mistakes, and try to avoid repeating them. As you do, you can be certain that Jehovah will show you mercy and provide you with the support you need.​—Ps. 103:8-13. w23.08 28-29 ¶8-9




Thursday, June 5

Jehoash continued doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.​—2 Ki. 12:2.



King Jehoash benefited from the good influence of Jehoiada. As a result, the young king wanted to please Jehovah. But after Jehoiada died, Jehoash listened to apostate princes. (2 Chron. 24:4, 17, 18) Deeply hurt, Jehovah “kept sending prophets among them to bring them back . . . , but they refused to listen.” They did not even listen to Jehoiada’s son Zechariah, who was not only Jehovah’s prophet and priest but also Jehoash’s cousin. In fact, King Jehoash had Zechariah killed. (2 Chron. 22:11; 24:19-22) Jehoash did not maintain a healthy fear of Jehovah. Jehovah had stated: “Those despising me will be treated with contempt.” (1 Sam. 2:30) A small Syrian army later defeated Jehoash’s “very large army” and “severely wounded” him. (2 Chron. 24:24, 25) Jehoash was assassinated by his own servants for killing Zechariah. w23.06 18-19 ¶16-17




Friday, June 6

You were once darkness, but you are now light.​—Eph. 5:8.



The apostle Paul had spent quite some time in Ephesus, preaching and teaching the good news. (Acts 19:1, 8-10; 20:20, 21) He loved his brothers very much and wanted to help them to remain faithful to Jehovah. The Ephesians to whom Paul wrote were once enslaved to false religious ideas and superstitions. Ephesus was famous for its gross immorality and brazen conduct. Obscene talk was commonly heard in the city’s theaters and even at religious festivals. (Eph. 5:3) Many of its inhabitants were “past all moral sense,” an expression that literally means “having ceased to feel pain.” (Eph. 4:17-19) Before learning what was truly right or truly wrong, the Ephesians did not feel pangs of conscience. Paul could thus describe them as being “in darkness mentally and alienated from the life that belongs to God.” Some of the Ephesians, though, did not remain in darkness. w24.03 20 ¶2, 4; 21 ¶5-6




Saturday, June 7

Those hoping in Jehovah will regain power. . . . They will . . . not tire out.​—Isa. 40:31.



Gideon’s assignment as judge involved a lot of physical exertion. When the Midianites fled during the nighttime battle, Gideon chased after them from the Valley of Jezreel all the way to the Jordan River. (Judg. 7:22) Did Gideon stop at the Jordan? No! Though tired, he and his 300 men crossed over and continued the pursuit. Finally, they caught up with the Midianites and defeated them. (Judg. 8:4-12) Gideon trusted that Jehovah would give him strength, and he was not disappointed. (Judg. 6:14, 34) Once, Gideon and his men were pursuing two Midianite kings on foot while the kings may have been riding camels. (Judg. 8:12, 21) Yet, with God’s help, the determined Israelites prevailed. Elders can likewise rely on Jehovah, the one who “never tires out or grows weary.” He will give them strength when they need it.​—Isa. 40:28, 29. w23.06 6 ¶14, 16




Sunday, June 8

[Jehovah] will neither desert you nor abandon you.​—Deut. 31:6.



We can have a steadfast heart no matter what trials we may face. So trust in Jehovah. Consider how Barak succeeded because of trusting in Jehovah’s direction. Although neither a shield nor a lance could be seen in all the land, Jehovah instructed him to go into battle against the well-equipped military forces of the Canaanite army chief Sisera. (Judg. 5:8) The prophetess Deborah told Barak to go down to the level plain to meet Sisera and his 900 chariots. Even though the chariots would offer a clear advantage on the flat ground, Barak obeyed. As the soldiers descended Mount Tabor, Jehovah sent pouring rains from heaven. Sisera’s chariots became mired in mud, and Jehovah gave Barak the victory. (Judg. 4:1-7, 10, 13-16) Similarly, Jehovah will give us the victory if we trust in him and in the direction he provides through his representatives. w23.07 19 ¶17-18




Monday, June 9

The one who has endured to the end will be saved.​—Matt. 24:13.



Patience is essential for our salvation. Like faithful servants of the past, we need to wait patiently for God to fulfill his promises. (Heb. 6:11, 12) The Bible compares our situation to that of a farmer. (Jas. 5:7, 8) A farmer works hard to plant and water his crop, but he does not know exactly when it will grow. So the farmer waits patiently, trusting that he will reap a crop. Likewise, we stay busy in spiritual activities even though we “do not know on what day [our] Lord is coming.” (Matt. 24:42) We wait patiently, confident that in his due time, Jehovah will fulfill all that he has promised. If we were to become impatient, we might get tired of waiting and start drifting away from the truth. We could also begin to pursue things that might give us instant gratification. But if we are patient, we can endure to the end and be saved.​—Mic. 7:7. w23.08 22 ¶7




Tuesday, June 10

The toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.​—Dan. 2:42.



By comparing the prophecy at Daniel 2:41-43 with others in the books of Daniel and Revelation, we can conclude that the feet represent the Anglo-American alliance, the dominant world power today. Regarding this world power, Daniel says that “the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.” Why partly fragile? Because the common people, pictured by the soft clay, undermine its ability to act with ironlike strength. From Daniel’s description of the dream image, we learn several important truths. First, the Anglo-American World Power has shown its strength in some ways. For example, it played a key role in winning World War I and World War II. However, this world power has been weakened and will continue to be weakened by internal conflicts among its own citizens. Second, this alliance will be the last world power to rule before God’s Kingdom puts an end to all human kingdoms. w23.08 10-11 ¶12-13




Wednesday, June 11

In my distress I called on Jehovah, to my God I kept crying for help. From his temple he heard my voice.​—Ps. 18:6.



At times, David felt distressed because of all the problems and trials he was facing. (Ps. 18:4, 5) Yet, Jehovah’s tender love and care refreshed him. Jehovah led his exhausted friend to “grassy pastures” and “well-watered resting-places.” As a result, David recovered his strength and was able to keep going. (Ps. 18:28-32; 23:2) Similarly today, “it is because of Jehovah’s loyal love that we have not come to our finish” when faced with life’s trials and struggles. (Lam. 3:22; Col. 1:11) David’s life was often in danger, and he had many powerful enemies. However, Jehovah’s love made him feel safe and protected. David could feel that Jehovah was with him in every situation, and that reassured him. Thus, he could sing: “[Jehovah] rescued me from all my fears.” (Ps. 34:4) David’s fears were real, but Jehovah’s love was stronger than his fears. w24.01 30 ¶15-17




Thursday, June 12

If sinners try to entice you, do not consent.​—Prov. 1:10.



Learn from Jehoash’s bad decisions. After High Priest Jehoiada died, Jehoash chose bad associates. (2 Chron. 24:17, 18) He decided to listen to the princes of Judah who did not love Jehovah. You likely agree that Jehoash should have avoided those troublemakers. Instead, he listened to his so-called friends. In fact, when Jehoash’s cousin Zechariah tried to correct him, Jehoash had him put to death. (2 Chron. 24:20, 21; Matt. 23:35) How terrible and foolish! Jehoash began his life well, but sadly he became an apostate and a murderer. Finally, his own servants killed him. (2 Chron. 24:22-25) How different his life would have turned out had he continued to listen to Jehovah and to those who loved Him! w23.09 9 ¶6




Friday, June 13

Stop being afraid.​—Luke 5:10.



Jesus knew that the apostle Peter could remain faithful. So Jesus kindly told Peter to “stop being afraid.” Jesus’ confidence in Peter had a lasting effect on him. Peter and his brother Andrew later abandoned their fishing business and became full-time followers of the Messiah, a decision that led to remarkable blessings. (Mark 1:16-18) Peter had many wonderful experiences as a follower of Christ. He saw Jesus heal the sick, expel demons, and even raise the dead. (Matt. 8:14-17; Mark 5:37, 41, 42) Peter also witnessed a vision of Jesus’ future Kingdom glory, an event that had a great impact on him. (Mark 9:1-8; 2 Pet. 1:16-18) Yes, Peter saw things he could never have anticipated. How glad he must have been that he did not allow any negative feelings about himself to cause him to miss out on these blessings! w23.09 21 ¶4-5




Saturday, June 14

Jesus said to him: “I say to you, not up to seven times, but up to 77 times.”​—Matt. 18:22.



In his first letter, the apostle Peter used the expression “intense love.” Such love covers, not just a few sins, but “a multitude of sins.” (1 Pet. 4:8) Perhaps Peter recalled the lesson about forgiveness that Jesus had taught him years earlier. At the time, Peter likely believed that he was being generous when he suggested that he would forgive his brother “up to seven times.” But Jesus taught him​—and us—​to forgive “up to 77 times,” meaning without limit. (Matt. 18:21) If you have found it hard to apply this counsel, take heart! All of Jehovah’s imperfect servants have at times struggled to forgive. The important thing now is for you to take any necessary steps to forgive your brother and to make peace with him. w23.09 29 ¶12




Sunday, June 15

I called out to Jehovah, and he answered me.​—Jonah 2:2.



In the belly of the fish, Jonah was confident that Jehovah would listen to his humble and repentant prayer and that Jehovah would help him. Later, Jonah was returned to dry land, and he was ready to accept and fulfill his next assignment. (Jonah 2:10–3:4) During a trial, do you ever feel too anxious to express yourself clearly in prayer? Or do you feel too weak to study? Remember that Jehovah understands your situation perfectly. So even when you offer a simple prayer, you can be sure that he will give you exactly what you need. (Eph. 3:20) If your physical or emotional pain makes it difficult for you to read and study, you might try listening to audio recordings of the Bible or of Bible-based publications. You may also find it helpful to listen to one of our songs or to watch a video on jw.org. By praying to Jehovah and by looking for the answer in the spiritual provisions that he makes available, you invite him to make you strong. w23.10 13 ¶6; 14 ¶9




Monday, June 16

The holy spirit makes it clear that the way into the holy place had not yet been revealed while the first tent was standing.​—Heb. 9:8.



The tabernacle and the temples that were built later in Jerusalem had the same basic layout. Inside were two compartments​—“the Holy Place” and “the Most Holy”—​that were separated by an embroidered curtain. (Heb. 9:2-5; Ex. 26:31-33) Inside the Holy was a golden lampstand, an altar for burning incense, and a table of showbread. Only “the anointed priests” were allowed inside the Holy to perform their sacred duties. (Num. 3:3, 7, 10) The Most Holy contained the golden ark of the covenant that represented Jehovah’s presence. (Ex. 25:21, 22) Only the high priest was allowed to pass beyond the curtain into the Most Holy on the annual Day of Atonement. (Lev. 16:2, 17) He entered with the blood of animals to make atonement for his own sins and for those of the entire nation. Eventually, Jehovah made clear the real significance of these features of the tabernacle.​—Heb. 9:6, 7. w23.10 27 ¶12




Tuesday, June 17

Love one another.​—John 15:17.



Again and again in God’s Word, we find the command to “love one another.” (John 15:12; Rom. 13:8; 1 Thess. 4:9; 1 Pet. 1:22; 1 John 4:11) However, love is a quality of the heart, or the inner person, and no human can see into our heart. So, then, how can we make our love for one another visible? By our words and actions. There are various ways in which we can show our brothers and sisters that we love them. Here are some examples: “Speak the truth with one another.” (Zech. 8:16) “Keep peace with one another.” (Mark 9:50) Take the lead “in showing honor to one another.” (Rom. 12:10) “Welcome one another.” (Rom. 15:7) “Continue . . . forgiving one another.” (Col. 3:13) “Go on carrying the burdens of one another.” (Gal. 6:2) “Keep comforting one another.” (1 Thess. 4:18) “Keep . . . building one another up.” (1 Thess. 5:11) “Pray for one another.”​—Jas. 5:16. w23.11 9 ¶7-8




Wednesday, June 18

Rejoice in the hope.​—Rom. 12:12.



Every day, we make decisions that require strong faith. For example, we make decisions involving our associations, entertainment, education, marriage, children, and secular work. We do well to ask ourselves: ‘Do my choices show that I am certain that this system is temporary and will soon be replaced by God’s new world? Or are my choices influenced by people who live as if death were the end of everything?’ (Matt. 6:19, 20; Luke 12:16-21) We will make the best decisions if we strengthen our faith that the new world is close at hand. We also face trials that require strong faith. We may face persecution, chronic illness, or other things that can cause us to become discouraged. At first, we might meet our trial with determination. But if it drags on​—as trials often do—​we will need strong faith in order to endure and to continue serving Jehovah with joy.​—1 Pet. 1:6, 7. w23.04 27 ¶4-5




Thursday, June 19

Pray constantly.​—1 Thess. 5:17.



Jehovah expects us to act in harmony with our prayers. For example, a brother may ask Jehovah to help him get time off from his secular work so that he can attend a regional convention. How might Jehovah answer that prayer? He might give the brother the courage he needs to approach his employer. But the brother will still need to follow through by making the request. He may need to ask repeatedly. He may even offer to trade shifts with another employee or take the time off without pay. Jehovah expects us to pray repeatedly about our concerns. Jesus implied that some of our requests would not be granted right away. (Luke 11:9) So do not give up! Pray earnestly and repeatedly. (Luke 18:1-7) When we do so, we show Jehovah that our request is not just a passing whim. We also demonstrate our faith in his ability to help us. w23.11 22 ¶10-11




Friday, June 20

Hope does not lead to disappointment.​—Rom. 5:5.



Jehovah promised his friend Abraham that all nations of the earth would be blessed by means of his offspring. (Gen. 15:5; 22:18) Because Abraham had deep faith in God, he was convinced that God’s promise would come true. Even so, when Abraham was 100 years of age and his wife was 90, that faithful couple still did not have a son. (Gen. 21:1-7) Yet, the Bible says: “Based on hope, [Abraham] had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said.” (Rom. 4:18) You know that Abraham’s hope was realized. He did become father to the son he had long hoped for, Isaac. What was the basis for Abraham’s confidence? Because of his close personal relationship with Jehovah, Abraham was “fully convinced that what [God] had promised” would come true. (Rom. 4:21) Jehovah approved of Abraham and declared him righteous because of his faith.​—Jas. 2:23. w23.12 8 ¶1-2




Saturday, June 21

The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.​—Luke 16:10.



A young man who is reliable diligently cares for all his responsibilities. Consider the perfect example of Jesus. He was never careless or irresponsible. Instead, he fulfilled the assignments that Jehovah gave him, even when it was difficult to do so. He loved people​—especially his disciples—​and he willingly gave his life for them. (John 13:1) In imitation of Jesus, work hard to fulfill any assignment that you are given. If you are not certain how to do it, be humble and ask for help from mature brothers. Never settle for doing the bare minimum. (Rom. 12:11) Instead, complete your assignment, doing it “for Jehovah, and not for men.” (Col. 3:23) Of course, you are not perfect, so be modest and admit any mistakes you make.​—Prov. 11:2. w23.12 26 ¶8




Sunday, June 22

Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah.​—Jer. 17:7.



It is a joy to get baptized and become part of Jehovah’s family. Those who are in that privileged position would agree with the psalmist David, who said: “Happy is the one whom you [Jehovah] choose and bring near to reside in your courtyards.” (Ps. 65:4) Jehovah does not bring just anyone into his courtyards. He chooses those who prove that they want to have a close relationship with him. (Jas. 4:8) When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah and get baptized, you can be sure that thereafter he will “pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.” (Mal. 3:10; Jer. 17:8) Baptism is just the beginning. You will want to do your best to live up to your dedication vow, even in the face of temptations or tests of faith. (Eccl. 5:4, 5) As a disciple of Jesus, you will follow Jesus’ example and commands as closely as possible.​—Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Pet. 2:21. w24.03 8 ¶1-3




Monday, June 23

A man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife.​—Gen. 2:24.



What if you and your spouse do not enjoy spending time together? What can you do? Consider a campfire. It does not start blazing instantly. It needs to be fed slowly with progressively bigger pieces of wood. Similarly, why not start by spending just a few moments together each day? Make sure to do something that you both enjoy. (Jas. 3:18) By starting small, you may begin to rekindle your love. Respect is vital in a marriage. It is like the oxygen that allows a campfire to burn brightly. Without oxygen, a fire quickly goes out. Similarly, without respect, a couple will find that their love can quickly grow cold. On the other hand, a husband and wife who strive to show respect for each other are working to keep their love alive. Yet, bear in mind that it is, not a matter of whether you think that you show respect, but a matter of whether your spouse feels respected. w23.05 22 ¶9; 24 ¶14-15




Tuesday, June 24

When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.​—Ps. 94:19.



In the Bible, faithful servants of God speak of times when they were in distress and trembling because of their enemies or other pressures. (Ps. 18:4; 55:1, 5) Similarly, we could be facing opposition at school, at work, from our family, or from the government. We could even be facing death because of a medical problem. During such times, we may feel as helpless as a small child. How does Jehovah help us in moments like these? He comforts and soothes us. So regularly spend time with Jehovah​—praying to him and reading his Word. (Ps. 77:1, 12-14) Then when you are under stress, your first thought will likely be to turn to your heavenly Father. Share your fears and concerns with Jehovah. Let him talk to you and console you through the Scriptures.​—Ps. 119:28. w24.01 24-25 ¶14-16




Wednesday, June 25

God is the one who . . . energizes you, giving you both the desire and the power to act.​—Phil. 2:13.



Motivation plays a key role in reaching spiritual goals. A motivated person has a strong incentive or desire to work toward his goal. And the more motivated we are, the more likely we are to reach our goals. So, what can you do to feel more motivated? Pray for more motivation. By means of his spirit, Jehovah can motivate you to reach your goal. Sometimes we set a goal because we know we should, and that is a good thing. But we may not really have the desire to reach it. Meditate on what Jehovah has done for you. (Ps. 143:5) The apostle Paul meditated on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness toward him, and this motivated him to work hard for Jehovah. (1 Cor. 15:9, 10; 1 Tim. 1:12-14) Similarly, the more you meditate on what Jehovah has done for you, the more motivated you will feel to reach your goal.​—Ps. 116:12. w23.05 27 ¶3-5




Thursday, June 26

Praise the name of Jehovah.​—Ps. 113:1.



We please our heavenly Father when we praise his name. (Ps. 119:108) Does this mean, though, that the almighty God is like imperfect humans who crave praise because they are needy or insecure? No. When we praise our heavenly Father, we help to refute a lie that involves us personally. Satan claims that no human will loyally defend God’s name. None of us have integrity, according to him. He says that all of us would turn against God if we thought that we would benefit by doing so. (Job 1:9-11; 2:4) But faithful Job proved Satan a liar. What about you? Each of us has the privilege of loyally standing up for our Father’s name and of pleasing him by serving him with integrity. (Prov. 27:11) It is truly an honor to do so. w24.02 8-9 ¶3-5




Friday, June 27

Put faith in his prophets, and you will be successful.​—2 Chron. 20:20.



After the days of Moses and Joshua, Jehovah raised up judges to guide his people. Then, during the time of the kings, Jehovah appointed prophets to guide his people. Faithful kings heeded the counsel of the prophets. For example, King David humbly accepted correction from the prophet Nathan. (2 Sam. 12:7, 13; 1 Chron. 17:3, 4) King Jehoshaphat relied on the prophet Jahaziel for guidance and encouraged the people of Judah to “put faith in [God’s] prophets.” (2 Chron. 20:14, 15) When in distress, King Hezekiah turned to the prophet Isaiah. (Isa. 37:1-6) Each time the kings followed Jehovah’s guidance, they were blessed and the nation was protected. (2 Chron. 20:29, 30; 32:22) It was obvious that Jehovah was using his prophets to guide his people. w24.02 21 ¶8




Saturday, June 28

Do not be sharers with them.​—Eph. 5:7.



Satan wants us to associate with people who make it harder for us to stick to Jehovah’s standards. We need to remember that our association is not limited to those we spend time with in person. It includes those we interact with on social media. We must fight against the world’s thinking that immoral conduct is acceptable. We know better. (Eph. 4:19, 20) We do well to ask ourselves: ‘Do I make it a point to avoid all unnecessary association with workmates, classmates, or others who do not respect Jehovah’s righteous standards? Do I courageously uphold Jehovah’s standards even though some may call me intolerant for doing so?’ As indicated at 2 Timothy 2:20-22, we may also need to be careful when choosing our close associates within the Christian congregation. We bear in mind that some may not help us to remain faithful in our service to Jehovah. w24.03 22-23 ¶11-12




Sunday, June 29

Jehovah is very tender in affection.​—Jas. 5:11.



Have you ever tried to imagine what Jehovah is like? Although Jehovah is invisible, the Bible describes him in various ways. Jehovah is called “a sun and a shield” and “a consuming fire.” (Ps. 84:11; Heb. 12:29) His presence is described as being similar to a sapphire stone, a glowing metal, and a brilliant rainbow. (Ezek. 1:26-28) Because we cannot see Jehovah, we may find it difficult to believe that he loves us. Some think that Jehovah could never love them because of their past experiences in life. Jehovah understands such feelings and how they affect us. To help us, he reveals his beautiful personality in his Word. The one word that best describes Jehovah is love. (1 John 4:8) Love defines him. It influences everything he does. God’s love is so warm and so powerful that he even extends it to those who do not love him.​—Matt. 5:44, 45. w24.01 26 ¶1-3




Monday, June 30

He would speak to them from the pillar of cloud.​—Ps. 99:7.



Jehovah appointed Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, and as visible evidence He provided a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night. (Ex. 13:21) Moses followed the pillar, which led him and the Israelites to the Red Sea. The people panicked when they thought that they were trapped between the sea and the pursuing Egyptian army. But it was no mistake. Jehovah had intentionally led his people there by means of Moses. (Ex. 14:2) God then delivered them in a most astonishing way. (Ex. 14:26-28) For 40 years thereafter, Moses continued to depend on the pillar of cloud to guide God’s people through the wilderness. (Ex. 33:7, 9, 10) From the pillar Jehovah spoke to Moses, who in turn conveyed His instructions to the people. The Israelites had ample evidence that Jehovah was using Moses to guide them. w24.02 21 ¶4-5
