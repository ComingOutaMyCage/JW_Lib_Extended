What have you done to me? . . . Why have you tricked me?​—Gen. 29:25.



Servants of Jehovah in Bible times faced challenges that they did not expect. Consider Jacob. He was commanded by his father to take a wife from the daughters of Laban, a believing relative, and was assured that Jehovah would bless him richly. (Gen. 28:1-4) So Jacob did the right thing. He left the land of Canaan and journeyed to the home of Laban, who had two daughters​—Leah and Rachel. Jacob fell in love with Laban’s younger daughter, Rachel, and agreed to work seven years for her father before marrying her. (Gen. 29:18) But matters did not turn out as Jacob had hoped. Laban tricked him into marrying his older daughter, Leah. Laban allowed Jacob to marry Rachel a week later, but only if he worked seven more years. (Gen. 29:26, 27) Laban was also unfair in his business dealings with Jacob. In all, Laban exploited Jacob for 20 years!​—Gen. 31:41, 42. w23.04 15 ¶5

Pour out your hearts before him.​—Ps. 62:8.



Whom can we turn to when we need comfort and guidance? We know the answer to that question. We can approach Jehovah God in prayer. Jehovah invites us to do just that. He wants us to pray often​—to “pray constantly.” (1 Thess. 5:17) We can freely approach him in prayer and seek his guidance in all aspects of our life. (Prov. 3:5, 6) Being the generous God he is, Jehovah places no limit on the number of times we can pray to him. Jesus understood that Jehovah values prayer. Long before coming to earth, he saw his Father answer the prayers of faithful men and women. For example, Jesus was at his Father’s side when He answered the sincere prayers of Hannah, David, and Elijah, to name a few. (1 Sam. 1:10, 11, 20; 1 Ki. 19:4-6; Ps. 32:5) No wonder Jesus taught his disciples to pray often and with confidence!​—Matt. 7:7-11. w23.05 2 ¶1, 3




Thursday, April 3

Trembling at men is a snare, but the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected.​—Prov. 29:25.



High Priest Jehoiada feared Jehovah. This was evident when Jezebel’s daughter, Athaliah, usurped the throne in Judah. She was ruthless and so greedy for power that she tried to murder the entire royal line​—her own grandsons! (2 Chron. 22:10, 11) One of those children​—Jehoash—​survived because Jehoiada’s wife, Jehoshabeath, rescued him. She and her husband hid the child and took care of him. In this way Jehoiada and Jehoshabeath helped preserve the Davidic line of kings. Jehoiada was loyal to Jehovah and did not tremble in fear of Athaliah. When Jehoash was seven years old, Jehoiada again proved his loyalty to Jehovah. He formed a plan. If it succeeded, Jehoash would become king, David’s rightful heir. If the plan failed, however, Jehoiada would almost certainly lose his life. With Jehovah’s blessing, the plan succeeded. w23.06 17 ¶12-13




Friday, April 4

Know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants.​—Dan. 4:25.



King Nebuchadnezzar could easily have viewed that message as seditious and could have put Daniel to death. But Daniel showed courage and delivered it anyway. What may have helped Daniel to be courageous throughout his life? While young, Daniel surely learned from the example of his mother and father. (Deut. 6:6-9) Daniel knew not only the basics of the Law, such as the Ten Commandments, but also the details regarding what an Israelite could and could not eat. (Lev. 11:4-8; Dan. 1:8, 11-13) Daniel also learned the history of God’s people and knew what happened to them when they failed to live by Jehovah’s standards. (Dan. 9:10, 11) Experiences throughout Daniel’s life made him confident that Jehovah and His powerful angels were supporting him.​—Dan. 2:19-24; 10:12, 18, 19. w23.08 3 ¶5-6




Saturday, April 5

Wisdom is with the modest ones.​—Prov. 11:2.



Rebekah was an intelligent and decisive woman who took the initiative in appropriate ways throughout her life. (Gen. 24:58; 27:5-17) Yet, she was respectful and submissive. (Gen. 24:17, 18, 65) If you humbly support Jehovah’s arrangements, as Rebekah did, you will be a positive influence on your family and on the congregation. Modesty is a quality that all mature Christians need. Esther was a modest, godly woman. Her modesty protected her from acting presumptuously. She listened to the advice of her older cousin Mordecai and followed it. (Esther 2:10, 20, 22) You can demonstrate similar modesty by seeking out and applying good advice. (Titus 2:3-5) Esther showed modesty in another way. She was “beautifully formed and attractive in appearance”; yet, she did not draw undue attention to herself.​—Esther 2:7, 15. w23.12 19-20 ¶6-8




Sunday, April 6

God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.​—1 John 3:20.



Excessive guilt is a weight we were never meant to carry. If we confessed our sin, repented, and are taking steps to avoid repeating our sin, we can trust that Jehovah has forgiven us. (Acts 3:19) After we have taken those steps, Jehovah does not want us to continue to feel guilty. He knows how damaging persistent guilt can be. (Ps. 31:10) If we become overwhelmed with sadness, we might give up in our race for life. (2 Cor. 2:7) When plagued with excessive guilt, focus on the “true forgiveness” that God provides. (Ps. 130:4) When he forgives those who sincerely repent, he promises: “I will no longer remember their sin.” (Jer. 31:34) This means that Jehovah will not thereafter hold your past sins against you. Do not punish yourself because your past mistakes may limit what you can now do in his service. Jehovah does not keep thinking about your sins, and neither should you. w23.08 30-31 ¶14-15




Monday, April 7

Be steadfast, immovable.​—1 Cor. 15:58.



During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jehovah’s Witnesses who listened to the guidance given by our organization avoided the undue anxieties experienced by those who listened to misleading information. (Matt. 24:45) We must not lose sight of “the more important things.” (Phil. 1:9, 10) Distractions can take an excessive amount of our time and attention away from more beneficial pursuits. Ordinary features of life​—such as eating, drinking, recreation, and secular work—​could become distractions if we allow them to become the focus of our life. (Luke 21:34, 35) In addition, every day we are bombarded with news reports about social disputes and political issues. We cannot afford to be distracted by these debates. Otherwise, we may begin to take sides in our mind and heart. Satan uses various methods with the goal of weakening our determination to do what is right. w23.07 16-17 ¶12-13




Tuesday, April 8

Keep doing this in remembrance of me.​—Luke 22:19.



For Jehovah’s people, the Memorial of Christ’s death is the most important day of the year. It is the only event that Jesus specifically commanded his followers to observe. (Luke 22:19, 20) It reminds us of ways we can show appreciation for Jesus’ sacrifice. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) It also gives us an opportunity to enjoy “an interchange of encouragement” with our brothers and sisters. (Rom. 1:12) And many interested people are motivated to start on the road to life by what they see and hear. Think, too, of how the Memorial unites our global brotherhood. No wonder the Memorial holds such a special place in our heart! w24.01 8 ¶1-3

God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.​—John 3:16.



The more we meditate on the price Jehovah and Jesus paid, the more we can understand how much they love every one of us. (Gal. 2:20) The ransom is a gift of love. Jehovah has proved his love for us by sacrificing what was most precious to him​—Jesus. Jehovah allowed his Son to suffer and die in our behalf. Jehovah does not keep his feelings to himself, but he warmly expresses his love. (Jer. 31:3) Jehovah has drawn us to him because he loves us. (Compare Deuteronomy 7:7, 8.) Nothing and no one can separate us from that love. (Rom. 8:38, 39) How does this love make you feel? w24.01 28 ¶10-11

On the basis of hope . . . , creation . . . will . . . be set free.​—Rom. 8:20, 21.



Anointed Christians cherish their heavenly hope. One of them, Brother Frederick Franz, said from his heart: “Our hope is a sure thing, and it will be fulfilled fully to every last one of the 144,000 members of the little flock to a degree beyond what we have even imagined.” In 1991 Brother Franz affirmed: “[We] have not lost our sense of value of that hope. . . . We are appreciating it all the more the longer we have to wait for it. It is something worth waiting for . . . I evaluate our hope more highly than ever before.” Whether we expect to enjoy everlasting life in heaven or on earth, we have a glorious hope that gives us reason to rejoice. And our joyful hope can grow even stronger. w23.12 9 ¶6; 10 ¶8

It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.​—Heb. 10:4.



Outside the entrance of the ancient tabernacle was a copper altar on which animal sacrifices were offered to Jehovah. (Ex. 27:1, 2; 40:29) However, those sacrifices could not provide complete forgiveness of sins for the people. (Heb. 10:1-3) The continual sacrifices of animals at the tabernacle pointed to the one sacrifice that would fully redeem humankind. Jesus knew that Jehovah had sent him to the earth to offer his human life as a ransom sacrifice for mankind. (Matt. 20:28) Hence, at his baptism, Jesus presented himself to do what Jehovah wanted. (John 6:38; Gal. 1:4) Jesus’ life was offered “once for all time” to atone for, or cover permanently, the sins of everyone who exercises faith in Christ.​—Heb. 10:5-7, 10. w23.10 26-27 ¶10-11

The gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.​—Rom. 6:23.



On our own, we could never redeem ourselves from sin and death. (Ps. 49:7, 8) So at great cost to himself and to his dear Son, Jehovah arranged for Jesus to give his life in our behalf. The more we meditate on what Jehovah and Jesus sacrificed for us, the more we will appreciate the ransom. When Adam sinned, he forfeited the prospect of everlasting life not only for himself but also for all his children. In order to buy back what Adam lost, Jesus offered his own perfect life as a sacrifice. During his entire life on earth, Jesus “committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.” (1 Pet. 2:22) At the time of his death, Jesus’ perfect life corresponded exactly to the life Adam lost.​—1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Tim. 2:6. w24.01 10 ¶5-6

Sunday, April 13

He entered into the holy place, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time, and obtained an everlasting deliverance for us.​—Heb. 9:12.



After Jesus was resurrected, he entered the Most Holy of the spiritual temple. Here we can clearly see the superiority of Jehovah’s arrangement for pure worship based on the ransom sacrifice and the priesthood of Jesus Christ. The high priest in Israel entered a man-made Most Holy with the blood of animal sacrifices, but Jesus entered “into heaven itself,” the holiest place of all, to appear before Jehovah. There he presented the value of his perfect human life in our behalf “to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself.” (Heb. 9:24-26) Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we all can worship Jehovah in his spiritual temple. w23.10 28 ¶13-14

Let us, then, approach the throne of undeserved kindness with freeness of speech.​—Heb. 4:16.



Think about Jesus’ role in the heavens as our reigning King and sympathetic High Priest. Through him we can approach God’s “throne of undeserved kindness” in prayer and ask for mercy and help “at the right time.” (Heb. 4:14, 15) May we never let a day pass without reflecting on what Jehovah and Jesus have done and are doing for us. Their love for us should touch our heart deeply and compel us to be zealous in our service and worship. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) One of the best ways to show our appreciation is to help others become Witnesses of Jehovah and disciples of Jesus. (Matt. 28:19, 20) This is what the apostle Paul did. He knew that Jehovah’s will is that “all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”​—1 Tim. 2:3, 4. w23.10 22-23 ¶13-14

Death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.​—Rev. 21:4.



Many of us use this heartwarming Bible passage about life in Paradise when preaching to others. How can we assure others​—and ourselves—​that the blessings described at Revelation 21:3, 4 will come true? Jehovah not only made this heartwarming promise but also provided convincing reasons why we can put our trust in it. We find reasons to trust in Jehovah’s promise of Paradise in the verses that follow. There we read: “The One seated on the throne said: ‘Look! I am making all things new.’ Also he says: ‘Write, for these words are faithful and true.’ And he said to me: ‘They have come to pass! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.’”​—Rev. 21:5, 6a. w23.11 3 ¶3-5

Keep on urging the younger men to be sound in mind.​—Titus 2:6.



A young man shows that he has developed sound thinking ability by making good choices in dress and grooming. Often, fashion trends are designed and promoted by people who have no regard for Jehovah or who lead immoral lives. Their immoral thinking is reflected in clothing styles that are tight-fitting or tend to make men look like women. When choosing what to wear, a young man who is growing to Christian maturity will be guided by Bible principles and by good examples in the congregation. He can ask himself: ‘Do my choices show that I am sound in mind and considerate of others? Does the way I dress make it easy for others to believe that I am devoted to serving God?’ (1 Cor. 10:31-33) A young man with thinking ability will gain the respect of not only his brothers and sisters but also his heavenly Father. w23.12 26 ¶7

My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought.​—John 18:36.



In the past, “the king of the south” has made direct attacks on Jehovah’s people. (Dan. 11:40) During the first half of the 20th century, for example, many brothers were imprisoned because of their Christian neutrality and some Witness children were expelled from school for the same reason. In recent decades, though, Jehovah’s servants living in the realm of that king have faced more subtle tests of their loyalty to God’s Kingdom. For instance, during election campaigns, a Christian might feel tempted to support one political party or candidate over another. He may not go so far as to vote; but in his mind and heart, he takes sides. How important it is that we remain politically neutral not only in our actions but also in our thoughts and feelings!​—John 15:18, 19. w23.08 12 ¶17




Friday, April 18

May Jehovah be praised, who daily carries our load.​—Ps. 68:19.



As we run our race for life, we must “run in such a way that [we] may win it.” (1 Cor. 9:24) Jesus said that we could “become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.” (Luke 21:34) These and other scriptures can help you to identify adjustments you might need to make as you run your race for life. We can be sure that we will win the race for life because Jehovah will give us the strength we need. (Isa. 40:29-31) Therefore, do not slow down! Imitate the apostle Paul, who put his all into acquiring the prize set before him. (Phil. 3:13, 14) No one can run this race for you, but with Jehovah’s help you can succeed. Jehovah can help you carry your loads and throw off unnecessary weights. With Jehovah on your side, you will be able to run your race with endurance and win! w23.08 31 ¶16-17




Saturday, April 19

Honor your father and your mother.​—Ex. 20:12.



When Jesus was 12 years old, his parents left him behind in Jerusalem. (Luke 2:46-52) It was ultimately Joseph and Mary’s responsibility to make sure that all their children were among the group who were traveling home after the festival. When Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus, Mary blamed him for the trouble he had caused them! Jesus could have pointed out how unjust this was. Instead, he gave his parents a simple and respectful reply. Joseph and Mary, however, “did not understand what he was saying to them.” Still, Jesus “continued subject to them.” Young ones, do you ever find it hard to obey your parents when they make mistakes or when they misunderstand you? What can help? Think about how Jehovah feels. The Bible says that when you obey your parents, “this is well-pleasing to the Lord.” (Col. 3:20) Jehovah knows when your parents do not fully understand you or when they make rules that are less than perfect. But when you choose to obey them anyway, you make him happy. w23.10 7 ¶5-6




Sunday, April 20

Be reasonable, displaying all mildness toward all men.​—Titus 3:2.



A schoolmate might assert that Jehovah’s Witnesses should change their view of homosexuality. We may need to assure him that we respectfully recognize that each person has the right to make his own choices. (1 Pet. 2:17) We might then be able to highlight the Bible’s beneficial moral standards. When confronted by someone who has strong views, we should not quickly assume that we know what he believes. For example, what if your schoolmate says that it is ridiculous to believe in God? Should you assume that he strongly believes in evolution and knows a lot about it? Actually, he may not have given the subject much thought. Perhaps you could direct him to material about creation found on jw.org. He might later be willing to discuss an article or a video found there. Yes, a respectful response may move him to reconsider his view. w23.09 17 ¶12-13




Monday, April 21

You, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive; you abound in loyal love for all those who call on you.​—Ps. 86:5.



We can be confident that Jehovah will use us and bless us even if we have made mistakes, provided that we do all we can to correct our ways and continue to rely on him. (Prov. 28:13) Samson was not perfect; yet, he did not give up in his efforts to serve Jehovah, even after his mistake with Delilah. And Jehovah did not give up on him. God once again used Samson in a mighty way. Jehovah still considered him to be a man of outstanding faith, including him in the list of faithful ones found in Hebrews chapter 11. How encouraging it is to know that we serve such a loving heavenly Father who yearns to strengthen us, especially when we are weak! So like Samson, let us beg Jehovah: “Remember me, please, and strengthen me.”​—Judg. 16:28. w23.09 7 ¶18-19




Tuesday, April 22

Keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.​—2 Pet. 3:12.



As we keep close in mind Jehovah’s day, we are moved to share the good news with others. Still, in some circumstances we may hesitate to speak up. Why? We may temporarily give in to fear of man. That happened to Peter. On the night of Jesus’ trial, Peter failed to identify himself as one of Jesus’ disciples and repeatedly denied even knowing him. (Matt. 26:69-75) This same apostle, however, could later say with conviction: “Do not fear what they fear, nor be disturbed.” (1 Pet. 3:14) Peter’s words assure us that we can overcome fear of man. What can help us to overcome fear of man? Peter tells us: “Sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts.” (1 Pet. 3:15) This includes meditating on the position and the power of our Lord and King, Christ Jesus. w23.09 27-28 ¶6-8




Wednesday, April 23

Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness . . . not even be mentioned among you.​—Eph. 5:3.



We must continue to fight against becoming entangled in “the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness.” (Eph. 5:11) Experience has shown that the more a person looks at, listens to, or talks about unclean, immoral things, the easier it will be for him to fall into wrongdoing. (Gen. 3:6; Jas. 1:14, 15) Satan’s world tries to deceive us, to make us believe that what Jehovah calls immoral and unclean is not wrong at all. (2 Pet. 2:19) One of the Devil’s long-used tactics is to confuse people so that they are unable to discern what is right and what is wrong. (Isa. 5:20; 2 Cor. 4:4) It is no wonder that many movies, television shows, and websites promote ideas that go against Jehovah’s righteous standards! Satan is trying to deceive us into thinking that unclean practices and lifestyles are harmless.​—Eph. 5:6. w24.03 22 ¶8-10




Thursday, April 24

These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things.​—Heb. 8:5.



The tabernacle was a tentlike structure that the Israelites initially carried with them as they moved from place to place. They used it for nearly 500 years until a permanent temple was built in Jerusalem. (Ex. 25:8, 9; Num. 9:22) The tabernacle was the central place for the Israelites to offer their sacrifices and their worship. (Ex. 29:43-46) However, the tabernacle also represented something much greater. It was “a shadow of the heavenly things,” and it pictured Jehovah’s great spiritual temple. The apostle Paul said that “this tent [or, tabernacle] is an illustration for the present time.” (Heb. 9:9) So by the time he wrote to the Hebrews, the spiritual temple had already become a reality for Christians. It came into existence in 29 C.E. That year, Jesus got baptized and began serving as Jehovah’s “great high priest” in the spiritual temple.​—Heb. 4:14; Acts 10:37, 38. w23.10 25-26 ¶6-7




Friday, April 25

Let your reasonableness become known to all men.​—Phil. 4:5.



To flourish spiritually, Christians must be flexible, ready to bend. How? We must be reasonable by adapting when our personal circumstances change and by respecting the viewpoints and decisions of others. As Jehovah’s servants, we want to be reasonable. We also want to be humble and compassionate. Jehovah is called “the Rock” because he is steadfast, immovable. (Deut. 32:4) However, he is also reasonable. As events unfold, our God continues to adapt in order to cause his purpose to be realized. Jehovah created humans in his image with the ability to adjust to changing circumstances. He provided clear Bible principles that help us to make wise decisions no matter what challenges we may face. Jehovah’s own example and the principles he has given us are evidence that while being “the Rock,” Jehovah is also reasonable. w23.07 20 ¶1-3




Saturday, April 26

When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.​—Ps. 94:19.



In the Bible, Jehovah compares himself to an affectionate mother. (Isa. 66:12, 13) Just imagine a mother who lovingly cares for her little child and makes sure he has what he needs. When we are in pain, we can count on Jehovah’s love. He does not give up on us when we do something wrong. (Ps. 103:8) The nation of Israel disappointed Jehovah time and again; yet, he expressed his unfailing love to his repentant people with these words: “You became precious in my eyes, you were honored, and I have loved you.” (Isa. 43:4, 5) God’s love has not changed. Even if we have made serious mistakes, when we repent and return to Jehovah, we will find his love for us intact. He promises that “he will forgive in a large way.” (Isa. 55:7) The Bible describes this forgiveness as bringing “seasons of refreshing . . . from Jehovah himself.”​—Acts 3:19. w24.01 27 ¶4-5




Sunday, April 27

The hand of Jehovah my God was upon me.​—Ezra 7:28.



Jehovah can help us when we are facing a challenge. For example, when asking our employer for time off so that we can attend a convention or when asking for an adjusted work schedule so that we can attend all our meetings, we create an opportunity to see Jehovah’s hand in our life. We may be surprised at how well things turn out. As a result, our confidence in Jehovah grows stronger. Ezra humbly turned to Jehovah for help. Each time he felt overwhelmed by his responsibilities, Ezra humbly prayed to Jehovah. (Ezra 8:21-23; 9:3-5) Ezra’s attitude moved those around him to support him and to imitate his faith. (Ezra 10:1-4) When we feel overwhelmed by anxieties about our material needs or about our family’s safety, we must confidently turn to Jehovah in prayer. w23.11 18 ¶15-17




Monday, April 28

[Abraham] put faith in Jehovah, and He counted it to him as righteousness.​—Gen. 15:6.



Jehovah does not say that if we want to be declared righteous we must do exactly what Abraham did. In fact, there are many ways in which we can manifest faith through our works. We can welcome new ones in the congregation, help brothers and sisters who are in genuine need, and do good to our family members, all of which are things that God will approve of and bless. (Rom. 15:7; 1 Tim. 5:4, 8; 1 John 3:18) An especially fine work that gives evidence of our faith is our zealously sharing the good news with others. (1 Tim. 4:16) All of us can show by our deeds that we have faith that Jehovah’s promises will come true and that his ways are best. And if we do, we have the firm assurance that God will count us as righteous and will call us his friends. w23.12 2 ¶3; 6 ¶15




Tuesday, April 29

Be strong and prove yourself a man.​—1 Ki. 2:2.



Close to his death, King David instructed Solomon with the above words. (1 Ki. 2:1, 3) All Christian men today do well to apply that advice. To be successful, they must learn to obey God’s laws and apply Bible principles in all aspects of their life. (Luke 2:52) Why is it so important for young brothers to become mature Christian men? A Christian man fulfills vital roles in the family and in the congregation. Young brothers, no doubt you have thought about the responsibilities you could have in the future. You might have the goal of being a full-time minister, a ministerial servant, and later a congregation elder. You might also want to get married and have children. (Eph. 6:4; 1 Tim. 3:1) To reach these goals and be successful, you need Christian maturity. w23.12 24 ¶1-2




Wednesday, April 30

Time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gideon.​—Heb. 11:32.



Christian elders have been entrusted with the care of Jehovah’s precious sheep. These devoted men treasure their privilege to serve their brothers and sisters, and they work hard to be “shepherds who . . . really shepherd.” (Jer. 23:4; 1 Pet. 5:2) How thankful we are to have such men in our congregations! Elders can learn from the example of Judge Gideon. (Heb. 6:12) He was both a protector and a shepherd of God’s people. (Judg. 2:16; 1 Chron. 17:6) Like Gideon, elders have been appointed to care for God’s people during a very turbulent time. (Acts 20:28; 2 Tim. 3:1) We can learn from Gideon’s modesty, humility, and obedience. His endurance was tested as he carried out his assignments. Whether we serve as an elder or not, we can grow in appreciation for our elders. We can support these hardworking spiritual men.​—Heb. 13:17. w23.06 2 ¶1; 3 ¶3
