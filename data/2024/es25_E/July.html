While on earth, Jesus showed the depth of his love for people by using his miraculous power to ease their suffering. On one occasion, two blind men cried out to him for help.

As used here, the Greek verb translated “moved with pity” refers to an intense compassion felt deep inside the body. Such deep compassion, which is an expression of love, also moved Jesus to feed the hungry and to cure a leper.

The apostle Paul said that we should focus on “encouraging one another.” When we realize that others in the audience can be encouraged by even a simple expression of our faith, we will feel better about volunteering to comment.

Every Jew, especially family heads, faced a decision: to leave Babylon or to stay behind. That decision might not have been an easy one to make. Old age prevented many from risking the hardships of the trip. And since most of the Jews had been born in Babylon, it was the only home they had ever known. To them, Israel was the land of their ancestors. Some Jews had apparently become very successful in Babylon, so they may have found it hard to leave their comfortable homes or their businesses and settle in an unfamiliar land. <a class="xt" data-xtid="210" href="jwpub://p/E:2023404/6-7"><em>w23.05</em> 14 ¶1-2</a></p>

<p id="p64" data-pid="64">Why is giving comfort to others an important expression of our love? According to a Bible reference work, the word that Paul used for “comfort” means “standing beside a person to encourage him when he is undergoing severe testing.” Thus, by giving comfort, we help a fellow believer who is in distress to get up and to continue walking on the road to life. Each time we offer a brother or a sister a shoulder to cry on, we express our love for our fellow believer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:6-47:7:7" data-bid="84-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:13-47:7:13" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Feeling compassion and giving comfort are closely related. In what way? A compassionate person is moved to comfort others and to try to relieve their suffering. So first we feel compassion; then we give comfort. Note how Paul connects Jehovah’s compassion to the comfort He gives. Paul describes Jehovah as “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="85-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="229" href="jwpub://p/E:2023641/15-17"><em>w23.11</em> 9-10 ¶8-10</a></p>

We therefore have every reason to trust the guidance that he is providing through those appointed to take the lead. <a class="xt" data-xtid="233" href="jwpub://p/E:2024285/22-23"><em>w24.02</em> 23-24 ¶13-14</a></p>

These will help you to shoulder responsibilities in the congregation, to hold a secular job to support yourself or a family, and to have healthy relationships with others. For example, learn to read and write well. The Bible says that a happy and successful man spends time each day reading God’s Word and meditating on it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>) By reading the Bible daily, he will get to know Jehovah’s way of thinking, which will help him to think clearly and to reason well.

You will also be able to take meaningful notes that will help you to build your own faith and to encourage others. <a class="xt" data-xtid="235" href="jwpub://p/E:2023686/16-18"><em>w23.12</em> 26-27 ¶9-11</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:6-9:1:10" data-bid="111-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:6-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:2-18:29:2" data-bid="111-2" class="b"> Job 29:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:4-18:29:4" data-bid="111-3" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:11-19:51:11" data-bid="111-4" class="b"> Ps. 51:11</a>) The Bible clearly shows that imperfect humans can gain Jehovah’s approval, or goodwill.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="112-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) We thus demonstrate publicly that we have repented of our sins and made a promise to God to do his will.

Many of us are coping with physical or emotional challenges, the loss of a loved one, a difficult family situation, persecution, or some other problem. And such things as pandemics and wars have made many of these challenges even harder to deal with. Pour out your heart to Jehovah. Tell him about your situation just as you would tell a close friend. Be assured that Jehovah “will act in your behalf.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:3-19:37:3" data-bid="116-1" class="b">Ps. 37:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:5-19:37:5" data-bid="116-2" class="b"> 5</a>) Persevering in prayer will help us to “endure under tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="117-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>) Jehovah knows what his worshippers are going through​—“he hears their cry for help.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:18-19:145:19" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Ps. 145:18, 19</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="238" href="jwpub://p/E:2023400/19-22"><em>w23.05</em> 5-6 ¶12-15</a></p>

Then as we apply his principles, we will more likely make good decisions. “The wicked one,” our enemy Satan, would like to keep us so busy with this world’s pursuits that we have no time for our service to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="121-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) It would be all too easy for a Christian to put material possessions, secular education, or his career ahead of opportunities to serve Jehovah. Were that to happen, it would indicate that he is being affected by the world’s thinking. Of course, these things are not wrong in themselves, but they should never take first place in our life. <a class="xt" data-xtid="239" href="jwpub://p/E:2024325/25-26"><em>w24.03</em> 24 ¶16-17</a></p>
