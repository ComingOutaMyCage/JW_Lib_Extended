Like an endangered species, respect seems to be rarely seen and stands out when it is shown.
For example, many people show little regard for one another, their parents, and the elderly, as well as for police, employers, and teachers. Meanwhile, on social media, rude remarks abound! According to an article in Harvard Business Review, disrespectful behavior is “indeed on the rise.” It adds that people are “reporting more of it​—and have been for a while now.”
