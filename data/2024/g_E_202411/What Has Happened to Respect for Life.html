<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><em>Practices and actions that show disrespect for life can adversely affect the health and the safety of a community.</em></p>

<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4">  Cigarette smoking not only <em>causes</em> cancer but also interferes with the body’s ability to fight it. All told, about 90 percent of lung-cancer deaths can be attributed to smoking or to exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5">  Mass shootings cause emotional trauma for many each year. A Stanford University report states: “Research indicates that even those who escape [school shootings] without any visible physical harm carry scars that could impair their lives for many years to come.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6">  People driving when under the influence of alcohol or drugs make roads and even pedestrian walkways unsafe. When people show a callous disregard for life, community members often become innocent victims.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="du-color--purple-500"><strong>Protect your health.</strong></span> It’s never too late to give up harmful practices such as smoking, vaping, overdrinking, or taking recreational drugs.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="du-color--purple-500"><strong>We provide humanitarian assistance.</strong></span> During a recent 12-month period, we responded to some 200 life-threatening disasters worldwide and spent nearly 12 million dollars of donated funds to provide relief for victims.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18">When Ebola outbreaks began to devastate the population of West Africa (2014) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018), we educated people on how to prevent the spread of the deadly disease. We sent representatives to speak to groups on the subject “Obedience Saves Lives.” We provided handwashing stations at the entrance of each of our places of worship and stressed the importance of handwashing and other practical safeguards.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19">In Sierra Leone, a radio announcement commended Jehovah’s Witnesses for helping Witnesses and non-Witnesses in the community to avoid the Ebola virus.</p>
