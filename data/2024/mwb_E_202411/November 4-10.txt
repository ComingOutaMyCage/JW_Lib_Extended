TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD







1. “He Remembers His Covenant Forever”


(10 min.)

Jehovah made a promise to Abraham and repeated it to Isaac and Jacob (Ge 15:18; 26:3; 28:13; Ps 105:8-11)
The fulfillment of this promise may have seemed unlikely (Ps 105:12, 13; w23.04 28 ¶11-12)
Jehovah never forgot his covenant with Abraham (Ps 105:42-44; it-2 1201 ¶2)

ASK YOURSELF, ‘How does Jehovah’s trustworthiness affect me?’

Such expressions of love endear us to Jehovah and benefit our brothers and sisters.
