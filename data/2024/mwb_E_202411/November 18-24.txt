TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. “Give Thanks to Jehovah, for He Is Good”


(10 min.)

Similar to the way Jehovah delivered Israel from Babylon, Jehovah has rescued us from Satan’s world (Ps 107:1, 2; Col 1:13, 14)
Thankfulness to Jehovah motivates us to praise him in the congregation (Ps 107:31, 32; w07 4/15 20 ¶2)
We can cultivate a grateful heart by carefully considering Jehovah’s loving acts (Ps 107:43; w15 1/15 9 ¶4)

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS

Song 46
7. We Sing to Thank Jehovah


(15 min.) Discussion.

After Jehovah delivered the terrified Israelites from the powerful Egyptian army at the Red Sea, his grateful people burst into song. (Ex 15:1-19) The men took the lead in singing this new song. (Ex 15:21) Jesus and early Christians also sang praises to God. (Mt 26:30; Col 3:16) We continue to express our appreciation to Jehovah by singing at congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions. For example, the song we just sang, “We Thank You, Jehovah,” has been sung at our meetings since 1966.
In some cultures, men may be embarrassed to sing in public. Others may hold back from singing because they feel that they do not have a pleasant singing voice. However, we should remember that singing at our meetings is part of our worship. Jehovah’s organization puts much effort into preparing beautifully composed songs and choosing appropriate ones to sing at each meeting. We have the easy part​—joining our voices together to express our heartfelt love and appreciation to our heavenly Father.
