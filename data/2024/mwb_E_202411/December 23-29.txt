7. Don’t Let Money Cause Unnecessary Pains


(15 min.) Discussion.

Those who reach out for the love of money “have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.” (1Ti 6:9, 10) Below are some of the unnecessary pains we will experience if we love money and let it become the driving force in our life.
  We will not be able to have a close relationship with Jehovah.​—Mt 6:24

  We will never be satisfied.​—Ec 5:10

  We will be more susceptible to moral temptations, including lying, theft, and treachery. (Pr 28:20) Giving in will result in feelings of guilt, a bad reputation, and loss of God’s favor







Read Hebrews 13:5, and then discuss this question:
  What view of money will prevent heartache, and why?

Your answer




Even if we do not love money, we will experience heartache if we do not manage it wisely.
