TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD






Repatriated Israelites reaping with joy because of Jehovah’s blessing on their hard work



1. They Sowed With Tears, but Reaped With Joy


(10 min.)

The Israelites were happy when they were freed from Babylon to restore pure worship (Ps 126:1-3)
Those who returned to Judea may have wept because of the considerable effort involved (Ps 126:5; w04 6/1 16 ¶10)
The people persisted and were blessed (Ps 126:6; w21.11 24 ¶17; w01 7/15 18-19 ¶13-14; see picture)







FOR MEDITATION: After we are delivered from this old world at Armageddon, what challenges will we have during the great reconstruction? What blessings will we reap?

7. Take Delight in God’s Promises


(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah fulfilled his promises to his people exiled in Babylon. He delivered them and healed them spiritually. (Isa 33:24) He evidently protected them and their domestic animals from falling prey to lions and other beasts that had increased during the time the people were gone. (Isa 65:25) They could enjoy living in their own homes and eating the fruitage of their own vineyards. (Isa 65:21) God blessed their work, and they enjoyed long lives.​—Isa 65:22, 23.
