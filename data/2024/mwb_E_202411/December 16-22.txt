Christian endurance is the ability to withstand hardship or adversity without being overcome by it. It involves being steadfast, keeping the right mental attitude and a hopeful outlook in the face of trials. If we have endurance, we will not “shrink back” or slow down in our Christian course when difficulties arise. (Heb 10:36-39) Jehovah is eager to help us endure trials.​—Heb 13:6.
For each of the following scriptures, write down how Jehovah helps us to endure.
