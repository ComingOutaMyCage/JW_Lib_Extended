TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. “They Forgot God Their Savior”


(10 min.)

When the Israelites became afraid, they rebelled against Jehovah (Ex 14:11, 12; Ps 106:7-9)
When the Israelites became hungry and thirsty, they murmured against Jehovah (Ex 15:24; 16:3, 8; 17:2, 3; Ps 106:13, 14)
When the Israelites became anxious, they worshipped idols (Ex 32:1; Ps 106:19-21; w18.07 20 ¶13)
