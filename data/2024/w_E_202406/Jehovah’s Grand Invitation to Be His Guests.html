A guest in that tent could expect to be well cared for. When we enter into a dedicated relationship with Jehovah, we become guests in his figurative tent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:61:4-19:61:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4</a>) We enjoy an abundance of spiritual food and the companionship of others who have also become Jehovah’s guests. His figurative tent is not confined to a particular location. You may have traveled to a foreign land, perhaps to attend a special convention, and met others who are blessed to be in God’s tent.

How should we conduct ourselves if we want to continue as his guests? If you were invited to someone’s home, you would want to know what he expects of you. For example, he might expect you to remove your shoes before entering, and you would willingly comply. Likewise, we certainly want to know what Jehovah requires of those who want to continue being guests in his tent.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:9:15-4:9:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Num. 9:15-23</a>) All could hear the loud, distinctive blasts of two silver trumpets signaling to everyone the need to start moving.
