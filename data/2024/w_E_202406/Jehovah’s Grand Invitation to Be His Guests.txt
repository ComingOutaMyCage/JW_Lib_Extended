SONG 28 Gaining Jehovah’s Friendship

Jehovah’s Grand Invitation to Be His Guests


“My tent will be with them, and I will be their God.”​—EZEK. 37:27.


FOCUS
To increase our appreciation for Jehovah’s invitation to be guests in his figurative tent and for the way he cares for us as our Host.


1-2. What invitation does Jehovah extend to his loyal worshippers?

Your answer


WHAT role does Jehovah play in your life? You may answer, ‘Jehovah is my Father, my God, and my Friend.’ There are also other titles, or designations, that you may apply to Jehovah. However, do you also view him as your Host?
2 King David compared Jehovah’s friendship with His loyal worshippers to the relationship between a host and his guests. He asked: “O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent? Who may reside in your holy mountain?” (Ps. 15:1) From these inspired words, we learn that we can become Jehovah’s guests​—his friends. Is this not a grand invitation from Jehovah?
JEHOVAH WANTS US TO BE HIS GUESTS
 3. Who was Jehovah’s first guest, and how did Jehovah and his guest feel about each other?

Your answer


3 Before creation, Jehovah was alone. But at one point, he welcomed his firstborn Son into his figurative tent. Jehovah took great pleasure in his new role as Host. The Bible reveals that Jehovah was “especially fond of” his Son. His first guest, in turn, “rejoiced before [Jehovah] all the time.”​—Prov. 8:30.
 4. How did Jehovah progressively extend the boundaries of his tent?

Your answer


4 Jehovah then created other spirit beings, inviting them to be his guests too. His angels are called “sons of God” and are described as being happy in Jehovah’s company. (Job 38:7; Dan. 7:10) For some time, God’s friendship was limited to those living in the spirit realm, where he dwells. Later, he extended his tent to include humans on earth. In time, among those favored ones were Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Job. Those true worshippers were described as God’s friends, or ones who walked “with the true God.”​—Gen. 5:24; 6:9; Job 29:4; Isa. 41:8.
 5. What can we learn from the prophecy found at Ezekiel 37:26, 27?

Your answer


5 Throughout the centuries, Jehovah continued to invite his friends to be his guests. (Read Ezekiel 37:26, 27.) For example, from Ezekiel’s prophecy we learn that God truly wants his loyal worshippers to have a warm relationship with him. He promises to make “a covenant of peace with them.” That prophecy points to a time when those who have a heavenly hope and those who have an earthly hope will be united under his figurative tent as “one flock.” (John 10:16) That time is now!
GOD CARES FOR US WHEREVER WE ARE
 6. How does someone become a guest in Jehovah’s tent, and where can His tent be found?

Your answer


6 In Bible times, a person’s tent was a place of rest and protection from the elements. A guest in that tent could expect to be well cared for. When we enter into a dedicated relationship with Jehovah, we become guests in his figurative tent. (Ps. 61:4) We enjoy an abundance of spiritual food and the companionship of others who have also become Jehovah’s guests. His figurative tent is not confined to a particular location. You may have traveled to a foreign land, perhaps to attend a special convention, and met others who are blessed to be in God’s tent. It can be found wherever his obedient worshippers happen to be.​—Rev. 21:3.
 7. Why can we say that faithful ones who have died are still guests in Jehovah’s tent? (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 What about faithful ones who have died? Can we reasonably conclude that they are still guests in Jehovah’s tent? Yes! Why can we say that? Because such ones are alive in Jehovah’s memory. Jesus explained: “That the dead are raised up, even Moses made known in the account about the thornbush, when he calls Jehovah ‘the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob.’ He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.”​—Luke 20:37, 38.




Even faithful ones who have died can be viewed as guests in God’s tent (See paragraph 7)




WE HAVE BENEFITS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
 8. How do Jehovah’s guests benefit from being in his tent?

Your answer


8 Just as a literal tent can be a place of rest and shelter from the elements, Jehovah’s tent provides his guests with protection from spiritual harm and hopelessness. When we remain close to Jehovah, Satan can do us no lasting harm. (Ps. 31:23; 1 John 3:8) In the new world, Jehovah will continue to protect his faithful friends not only from spiritual harm but also from death.​—Rev. 21:4.
 9. How does Jehovah expect his guests to conduct themselves?

Your answer


9 It truly is a great honor to be a guest in Jehovah’s tent​—to enjoy a personal and ongoing relationship with him. How should we conduct ourselves if we want to continue as his guests? If you were invited to someone’s home, you would want to know what he expects of you. For example, he might expect you to remove your shoes before entering, and you would willingly comply. Likewise, we certainly want to know what Jehovah requires of those who want to continue being guests in his tent. Our love for Jehovah moves us to do everything in our power “to please him fully.” (Col. 1:10) And while we view Jehovah as our Friend, we realize that he is also our God and Father, who is worthy of our respect. (Ps. 25:14) With that in mind, we should always be in awe of him, never forgetting who he is. Such reverence will help us to avoid conduct that would offend him. We certainly desire “to walk in modesty” with our God.​—Mic. 6:8.
JEHOVAH’S IMPARTIALITY IN THE WILDERNESS
10-11. How did Jehovah’s dealings with the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai show his impartiality?

Your answer


10 Jehovah is impartial in his dealings with his guests. (Rom. 2:11) We can gain insight into Jehovah’s impartiality from the way he dealt with the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai.
11 After he had delivered his people from slavery in Egypt, Jehovah appointed priests to serve at the tabernacle. Levites were assigned to share in other duties related to that holy tent. Did those who served at the tabernacle or who were encamped close to it enjoy better care from Jehovah than others? No! Jehovah is not partial.
12. How did Jehovah display impartiality as the Host of his newly formed nation? (Exodus 40:38) (See also picture.)

Your answer


12 Everyone in the encampment had an equal opportunity to enjoy Jehovah’s friendship, regardless of any special appointments or where they lived in relation to the tabernacle. For example, Jehovah made sure that the entire nation was able to see the miraculous pillar of cloud and pillar of fire posted above the tabernacle. (Read Exodus 40:38.) When the cloud started to move in a new direction, even those encamped farthest from the tabernacle were able to see that, assemble their belongings, dismantle their family tents, and keep pace with the rest of the nation. (Num. 9:15-23) All could hear the loud, distinctive blasts of two silver trumpets signaling to everyone the need to start moving. (Num. 10:2) Clearly, living in close proximity to the tabernacle was not in itself evidence of a closer friendship with Jehovah. Rather, everyone in Jehovah’s newly formed nation could be His guest and count on His direction and protection. Similarly today, no matter where we live on earth, we can benefit from Jehovah’s loving, watchful care and protection.




God’s arrangement for the tabernacle reflected his impartiality (See paragraph 12)




MODERN EXAMPLES OF JEHOVAH’S IMPARTIALITY
13. What is one way that Jehovah displays impartiality today?

Your answer


13 Some among God’s people today live near world headquarters or a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Others actually serve at these facilities. As a result, such ones can share in many of the activities that take place at these locations and personally associate with those who take the lead. Some serve as traveling overseers or in other forms of special full-time service. If you are among the vast majority who do not presently enjoy such circumstances, rest assured that our Host, Jehovah, loves all his approved guests. And he gives all of them his personal care. (1 Pet. 5:7) All of God’s people receive the spiritual nourishment, direction, and protection they need.
14. What is another example of Jehovah’s impartiality as our Host?

Your answer


14 Another example of Jehovah’s impartiality as our Host is that he makes the Bible accessible to people around the globe today. The Holy Scriptures were originally written in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Do those who can read the original Bible languages have a closer relationship with Jehovah than those who cannot? No, they do not.​—Matt. 11:25.
15. What gives evidence of Jehovah’s impartiality? (See also picture.)

Your answer


15 Jehovah’s approval of us is not dependent on our secular education or on our ability with languages. Rather than offer his wisdom only to the highly educated, Jehovah makes it accessible to people around the earth, whether they are highly educated or not. His inspired Word, the Bible, has been translated into thousands of languages; thus, people the world over can benefit from its teachings and learn how they can become his friends.​—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.




How does the availability of the Bible today give evidence of God’s impartiality? (See paragraph 15)




REMAIN “ACCEPTABLE” TO JEHOVAH
16. According to Acts 10:34, 35, how can we remain acceptable to Jehovah?

Your answer


16 It is a great privilege to be welcomed by Jehovah as guests in his figurative tent. He is the kindest, most loving, and most hospitable Host imaginable. Furthermore, he is impartial, welcoming all of us regardless of our location, background, education, race, tribe, age, or gender. Yet, only those who meet his standards are acceptable as his guests.​—Read Acts 10:34, 35.
17. Where will we find additional information about being a guest in Jehovah’s tent?

Your answer


17 As recorded at Psalm 15:1, David raised the questions: “O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent? Who may reside in your holy mountain?” The psalmist was inspired to answer those questions. The following article will discuss some of the specific requirements we must meet to remain acceptable to Jehovah.
