SONG 24 Come to Jehovah’s Mountain

Remain Jehovah’s Guest Forever!


“O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent?”​—PS. 15:1.


FOCUS
To examine what is required to keep enjoying friendship with Jehovah and to review how he expects us to treat his friends.


 1. Why can we benefit from considering Psalm 15:1-5?

Your answer


IN THE preceding article, we learned that Jehovah’s dedicated servants can be guests in his figurative tent by cultivating a close, personal relationship with him. But how can we qualify for such a relationship? Psalm 15 has much to say on this subject. (Read Psalm 15:1-5.) This psalm offers practical lessons that can help us to draw closer to God.
 2. What might have moved the psalmist David to mention Jehovah’s tent?

Your answer


2 Psalm 15 opens: “O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent? Who may reside in your holy mountain?” (Ps. 15:1) When mentioning Jehovah’s “tent,” the psalmist David may have been thinking of the tabernacle, which was in Gibeon for a time. David also mentions God’s “holy mountain,” perhaps referring to Zion in Jerusalem. There, several miles south of Gibeon, David pitched a tent to house the ark of the covenant until a more permanent resting place for it could be built.​—2 Sam. 6:17.
 3. Why should Psalm 15 interest us? (See also picture.)

Your answer


3 Of course, most Israelites were never allowed to serve at the tabernacle, much less venture inside the tent where the ark of the covenant was kept. But all of Jehovah’s faithful servants could be guests in his figurative tent by becoming and remaining his friends. That is something we all desire. Psalm 15 outlines some qualities that we need to develop and display to remain Jehovah’s friends.




The Israelites in David’s day could form a mental image of being a guest in Jehovah’s tent (See paragraph 3)




WALK FAULTLESSLY AND PRACTICE WHAT IS RIGHT
 4. How do we know that baptism is not all that Jehovah requires of us? (Isaiah 48:1)

Your answer


4 At Psalm 15:2, a friend of God is described as “the one who is walking faultlessly, practicing what is right.” The terms “walking” and “practicing” imply action that is both constant and progressive. But can we really ‘walk faultlessly’? Yes. While no human is perfect, Jehovah will view us as “walking faultlessly” if we do our best to obey him. When we dedicate ourselves to God and get baptized, we are just starting on our journey with God. Note that in Bible times, merely belonging to the nation of Israel would not automatically qualify a person to be a guest of Jehovah. Some called on him but not “in truth and righteousness.” (Read Isaiah 48:1.) Sincere Israelites had to learn about Jehovah’s requirements and follow them. Similarly, to enjoy God’s approval today, more is required of us than getting baptized and associating with the Christian congregation. We must keep “practicing what is right.” What does that entail?
 5. What does obedience to Jehovah in all things involve?

Your answer


5 In Jehovah’s eyes, “walking faultlessly” and “practicing what is right” mean more than regularly sharing in some activities at a place of worship. (1 Sam. 15:22) We must strive to obey God in every aspect of our life, even when we are alone. (Prov. 3:6; Eccl. 12:13, 14) It is important that we try to obey Jehovah even in relatively minor matters. Doing so shows that we truly love him, which endears us to him.​—John 14:23; 1 John 5:3.
 6. According to Hebrews 6:10-12, what is more important than any acts of faithfulness we did in the past?

Your answer


6 Jehovah deeply appreciates what we have done for him in the past. However, past acts of faithfulness alone do not qualify us to remain as guests in Jehovah’s tent. This is made clear at Hebrews 6:10-12. (Read.) Jehovah does not forget our past good deeds. But he wants us to keep rendering whole-souled worship “down to the end.” He will reward us with eternal friendship “if we do not tire out.”​—Gal. 6:9.
SPEAK THE TRUTH IN YOUR HEART
 7. What does speaking the truth in our heart involve?

Your answer


7 Someone who wants to be an approved guest in Jehovah’s tent must be “speaking the truth in his heart.” (Ps. 15:2) This means more than not lying. Jehovah wants us to be honest through and through. (Heb. 13:18) That is important, “for Jehovah detests a devious person, but his close friendship is with the upright.”​—Prov. 3:32.
 8. What conduct do we need to avoid?

Your answer


8 Those who ‘speak the truth in their heart’ do not pretend to be obedient in public while breaking God’s laws in secret. (Isa. 29:13) They avoid acting deviously. A devious person may begin to doubt the wisdom of some of Jehovah’s regulations. (Jas. 1:5-8) He may disobey Jehovah on matters that seem to him to be of little importance. Then if there appear to be no consequences for his disobedience, he may be emboldened to violate God’s laws further, and his worship would become hypocritical. (Eccl. 8:11) We, however, want to be honest in all things.
 9. What can we learn from Jesus’ first meeting with Nathanael? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 We can learn about the importance of having a sincere heart from Jesus’ first meeting with Nathanael. When Philip brought his friend Nathanael to meet Jesus, something remarkable happened. Although Jesus had never met Nathanael, Jesus said: “See, truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.” (John 1:47) Surely Jesus viewed his other disciples as honest, but Jesus saw in Nathanael an extraordinary sincerity. Like us, Nathanael was imperfect. But there was nothing artificial or insincere about him. Jesus admired that and commended Nathanael for it. What an honor it would be if Jesus could point that out about us!




Philip presented to Jesus his friend Nathanael, a man who was without deceit. Could the same be said about us? (See paragraph 9)




10. Why should we avoid misusing the gift of speech? (James 1:26)

Your answer


10 Most of the requirements listed in Psalm 15 are related to how we treat others. Psalm 15:3 states that a guest in Jehovah’s tent “does not slander with his tongue, he does nothing bad to his neighbor, and he does not defame his friends.” Misusing our speech in such ways could cause serious harm to others and disqualify us from being guests in Jehovah’s tent.​—Read James 1:26.
11. What is slander, and what action is taken toward unrepentant slanderers?

Your answer


11 The psalmist specifically mentions slander. What is slander? Generally, it is a false statement that can ruin someone’s reputation. Unrepentant slanderers are removed from the Christian congregation.​—Jer. 17:10.
12-13. What are some situations in which we could inadvertently become guilty of defaming our friends? (See also picture.)

Your answer


12 Psalm 15:3 also reminds us that Jehovah’s guests do nothing bad to their neighbors and do not defame their friends. What might that involve?
13 We could unintentionally defame someone by spreading negative information. For example: (1) a sister discontinues her full-time service, (2) a married couple no longer serve at Bethel, or (3) a brother is no longer serving as an elder or a ministerial servant. Would it be proper to speculate on the reasons why these adjustments were made and to share that opinion with others? There may well be reasons for the change that we are unaware of. Furthermore, a guest in Jehovah’s tent “does nothing bad to his neighbor, and he does not defame his friends.”




It is easy to spread negative information about others, perhaps bordering on slander (See paragraphs 12-13)




HONOR THOSE WHO FEAR JEHOVAH
14. Explain how Jehovah’s guests reject “anyone who is contemptible.”

Your answer


14 Psalm 15:4 says that a friend of Jehovah “rejects anyone who is contemptible.” How can we do that? As imperfect humans, we are not qualified to determine whether someone is contemptible. Why? We might naturally be drawn to some people based on their personality traits and be annoyed by other people. Hence, we should reject only those whom Jehovah finds “contemptible.” (1 Cor. 5:11) This includes those who unrepentantly practice what is bad, disrespect our faith and beliefs, or try to undermine our spirituality.​—Prov. 13:20.
15. What is one way to honor “those fearing Jehovah”?

Your answer


15 Conversely, Psalm 15:4 asks us to honor “those fearing Jehovah.” We accordingly look for ways to show kindness and respect to Jehovah’s friends. (Rom. 12:10) How? One way, based on Psalm 15:4, is that a guest in Jehovah’s tent “does not go back on his promise, even when it is bad for him.” Breaking our promises could surely hurt others. (Matt. 5:37) For example, Jehovah expects his guests to live up to their marriage vow. He is also pleased when parents make earnest efforts to fulfill promises they make to their children. Our love for God and for neighbor will compel us to keep our word to the best of our ability.
16. What is another way to honor Jehovah’s friends?

Your answer


16 Another way to honor God’s friends is by being hospitable and generous. (Rom. 12:13) Leisure time spent with our brothers and sisters helps us to strengthen bonds of friendship with them and with Jehovah. Moreover, by showing hospitality, we imitate Jehovah.
REMAIN FREE OF THE LOVE OF MONEY
17. Why is the subject of money brought up in Psalm 15?

Your answer


17 We read that a guest of Jehovah “does not lend his money on interest, and he does not accept a bribe against the innocent.” (Ps. 15:5) Why is money brought up in this short psalm? Because an unbalanced view of money can hurt others and ruin our friendship with God. (1 Tim. 6:10) In Bible times, some took advantage of their poor brothers by charging them interest on the money lent to them. Also, some judges accepted bribes and then judged innocent victims unfairly. Such practices are detestable to Jehovah.​—Ezek. 22:12.
18. What questions can help us evaluate our personal attitude toward money? (Hebrews 13:5)

Your answer


18 It is good for us to evaluate our personal attitude toward money. Ask yourself: ‘Do I often find myself thinking about money and what it can buy? If I borrow money, am I slow to repay it, concluding that the person who lent it to me does not need it? Does having money make me feel important but make it hard to be generous? Do I judge my brothers and sisters as materialistic simply because they have money? Do I cultivate friendship with the rich and show little interest in the poor?’ We have received the grand opportunity to be Jehovah’s guests. We can protect that privilege by keeping our life free of the love of money. If we do so, Jehovah will never leave us!​—Read Hebrews 13:5.
JEHOVAH LOVES HIS FRIENDS
19. What is the main objective behind Jehovah’s requirements?

Your answer


19 Psalm 15 ends with the promise: “Whoever does these things will never be shaken.” (Ps. 15:5) Here the psalmist reveals the main objective behind God’s requirements. Jehovah wants us to be happy. So he gives us direction that will bring us his blessing and protection.​—Isa. 48:17.
20. What can Jehovah’s guests look forward to?

Your answer


20 Jehovah’s approved guests can look forward to a bright future. The faithful anointed will have admission into the “many dwelling places” that Jesus prepared for them in heaven. (John 14:2) Those with the earthly hope look forward to what Revelation 21:3 promises. Surely, we all feel highly honored to have received Jehovah’s warm invitation to be his friends, to be everlasting guests in his tent!
