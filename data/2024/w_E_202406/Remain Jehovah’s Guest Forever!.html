But can we really ‘walk faultlessly’? Yes. While no human is perfect, Jehovah will view us as “walking faultlessly” if we do our best to obey him. When we dedicate ourselves to God and get baptized, we are just starting on our journey with God. Note that in Bible times, merely belonging to the nation of Israel would not automatically qualify a person to be a guest of Jehovah. Some called on him but not “in truth and righteousness.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:1-23:48:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 48:1</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Sincere Israelites had to learn about Jehovah’s requirements and follow them.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:10-54:6:10" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:10</a>) In Bible times, some took advantage of their poor brothers by charging them interest on the money lent to them. Also, some judges accepted bribes and then judged innocent <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>victims unfairly.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[73]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> It is good for us to evaluate our personal attitude toward money. Ask yourself: ‘Do I often find myself thinking about money and what it can buy? If I borrow money, am I slow to repay it, concluding that the person who lent it to me does not need it? Does having money make me feel important but make it hard to be generous? Do I judge my brothers and sisters as materialistic simply because they have money? Do I cultivate friendship with the rich and show little interest in the poor?’ We have received the grand opportunity to be Jehovah’s guests. We can protect that privilege by keeping our life free of the love of money. If we do so, Jehovah will never leave us!​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:5" data-bid="38-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 13:5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
