These men are a stabilizing influence on others and strengthen the congregation by “holding firmly to the faithful word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:9-56:1:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Titus 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:3" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:1-3</a>) By their example and their shepherding, elders help publishers to be regular in their meeting attendance, field service, and personal study. When brothers and sisters face unsettling events, elders can do much by encouraging them to keep their focus on Jehovah and his purposes.</p>
