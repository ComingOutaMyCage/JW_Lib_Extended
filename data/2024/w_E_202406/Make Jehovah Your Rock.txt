SONG 8 Jehovah Is Our Refuge

Make Jehovah Your Rock


“There is no rock like our God.”​—1 SAM. 2:2.


FOCUS
Learn why Jehovah is referred to as a rock and how we can imitate his rocklike qualities.


 1. To what does David compare Jehovah, as recorded at Psalm 18:46?

Your answer


WE LIVE in a world where unexpected challenges can disrupt​—or even completely change—​our lives. How thankful we are that we can turn to Jehovah God for help! In the preceding article, we were reminded that Jehovah is the living God and that he is always ready to help us. When we receive his support, that experience reassures us that “Jehovah is alive!” (Read Psalm 18:46.) However, right after making that declaration, David called God “my Rock.” Why would he liken Jehovah, the living God, to an inanimate object​—a rock?
 2. Why should we be interested in the fact that David called Jehovah “my Rock”?

Your answer


2 In this article, we will consider why Jehovah is referred to as a rock and what that metaphor teaches us about him. We will also learn how we can come to view him as our Rock. Finally, we will discuss ways that we can imitate Jehovah’s rocklike qualities.
WHY JEHOVAH IS A ROCK
 3. How does the Bible often use the word “rock”? (See picture.)

Your answer


3 The Bible uses the term “rock” as a word picture to help us grasp qualities that Jehovah possesses. It often appears in passages that praise him as a God who is without equal. The first reference to Jehovah as “the Rock” is found at Deuteronomy 32:4. In prayer, Hannah said that “there is no rock like our God.” (1 Sam. 2:2) Habakkuk called Jehovah “my Rock.” (Hab. 1:12) The writer of Psalm 73 called God “the rock of my heart.” (Ps. 73:26) And even Jehovah referred to himself as a rock. (Isa. 44:8) Let us discuss three rocklike qualities that Jehovah displays and learn how we can make him “our Rock.”​—Deut. 32:31.




God’s people consider Jehovah to be like a secure rock (See paragraph 3)




 4. How is Jehovah a refuge? (Psalm 94:22)

Your answer


4 Jehovah is a refuge. Just as a huge rock can be a person’s hiding place from a threatening storm, Jehovah safeguards us when we face situations that threaten our well-being. (Read Psalm 94:22.) He keeps us safe and prevents us from suffering lasting harm. And he promises even more: He will eventually eliminate whatever threatens our peace and security.​—Ezek. 34:25, 26.
 5. How can Jehovah become our rocklike Refuge?

Your answer


5 One way we make Jehovah our rocklike Refuge is by praying to him. When we pray, Jehovah gives us “the peace of God” that safeguards our heart and mind. (Phil. 4:6, 7) Consider the experience of Artem, a brother who was imprisoned for his faith. He was repeatedly interrogated by a harsh investigator who pressured and humiliated him. “I found it stressful whenever the investigator summoned me. . . . I always prayed to Jehovah. I asked for peace in my heart and for wisdom,” said Artem. “The investigator’s tactics did not work on me. . . . With Jehovah’s help, it was like I was standing behind a stone wall.”
 6. Why can we always rely on Jehovah? (Isaiah 26:3, 4)

Your answer


6 Jehovah is reliable. Like a rock that is immovable, Jehovah is always there for us. We can trust him because he is “the eternal Rock.” (Read Isaiah 26:3, 4.) He will always be alive to keep his promises, hear our prayers, and give us the support we need. We can also depend on Jehovah because he is loyal to those who serve him. (2 Sam. 22:26) He will never forget what we do, and he will always reward us.​—Heb. 6:10; 11:6.
 7. What will we experience when we rely on Jehovah? (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 We make Jehovah our Rock when we rely fully on him. We trust that by obeying him even during difficult times, we will benefit. (Isa. 48:17, 18) As we experience his support, our confidence in him will grow. We will then be better prepared to face trials that only Jehovah can get us through. Often during situations in which there is no one else to turn to for help, we come to realize just how reliable Jehovah is. “The time I spent in the detention center was the very best period in my relationship with God,” said Vladimir. “I learned to have greater trust in Jehovah because I was all alone and had no control of the situation.”




We make Jehovah our Rock when we rely fully on him (See paragraph 7)




 8. (a) Why can we say that Jehovah is stable? (b) How do we benefit from having God as our Rock? (Psalm 62:6, 7)

Your answers


8 Jehovah is stable. Similar to a massive rock, Jehovah is firm and stable. He is consistent in his personality and unshakable in his purpose. (Mal. 3:6) When faced with the rebellion in Eden, Jehovah did not waver. As the apostle Paul wrote, Jehovah “cannot deny himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13) This means that no matter what happens or what others do, Jehovah will never deviate from his qualities, his purpose, or his standards. With confidence in our stable God, we can look to him for salvation and for help to cope during turbulent times.​—Read Psalm 62:6, 7.
 9. What do you learn from Tatyana’s experience?

Your answer


9 We make Jehovah our Rock by focusing on the kind of Person he is and by keeping his purpose fixed firmly in our mind. Doing so can help us to remain stable emotionally while we endure trials. (Ps. 16:8) That was true of a sister named Tatyana, who was placed under house arrest because of her faith. “I found myself literally on my own,” she said. “It was challenging at first. I was often discouraged.” However, when she saw how her trial related to Jehovah and his purpose, she was able to cope and to regain emotional strength. She said: “Understanding why this was happening helped me to remember that it is for Jehovah that I find myself in these circumstances. That has helped me to stop thinking about myself.”
10. How can Jehovah be our Rock now?

Your answer


10 In the days ahead, we will encounter trials that will require us to lean on Jehovah as never before. Now is the time to strengthen our conviction that he will provide whatever we need to endure faithfully. How can we do that? Read Bible accounts and experiences of modern-day Witnesses. Discern how God has displayed rocklike qualities to support his servants. Think deeply about those accounts. Doing so can help you to make Jehovah your Rock.
IMITATE JEHOVAH’S ROCKLIKE QUALITIES
11. Why do we want to imitate Jehovah’s rocklike qualities? (See also the box “A Goal for Young Brothers.”)

Your answer


11 We have noted how Jehovah proves to be like a rock. Now consider how we can imitate his rocklike qualities. The better we do so, the better equipped we will be to build up the congregation. For example, Jesus gave Simon the name Cephas (translated “Peter”), which means “A Piece of Rock.” (John 1:42) This indicated that he would become a source of comfort and stability in the congregation. Congregation elders are described as “the shadow of a massive crag.” That illustrates how they protect those in the congregation. (Isa. 32:2) Of course, the congregation benefits when all​—brothers and sisters—​imitate Jehovah’s rocklike qualities.​—Eph. 5:1.





A GOAL FOR YOUNG BROTHERS
Why not imitate Jehovah’s rocklike qualities now? You will thus develop the qualities that you will need to serve as an elder, perhaps by the time you are in your early or mid-20’s.
  Be a refuge. Make others feel welcome at the meetings by talking with them. Show personal interest in older ones.

  Be reliable. Volunteer to help at the Kingdom Hall. When given an assignment, follow the instructions on how to do it.

  Be stable. Read the Bible every day, and think about what you read. Learn how to make decisions using Bible principles.




12. Describe ways in which we can be a refuge for others.

Your answer


12 Be a refuge. At times, we may be able to offer our brothers literal refuge from natural disasters, civil unrest, or war. As conditions in “the last days” get worse, we will no doubt have more opportunities to render aid to one another. (2 Tim. 3:1) We can also provide an emotional and spiritual haven for our brothers. One way we can do that is by making them feel welcome at the Kingdom Hall, contributing to the warm atmosphere in the congregation. We live in a harsh, cold, and stressful world. So when our brothers and sisters attend meetings, we want to do all we can to make them feel loved, refreshed, and secure.
13. How can elders in particular become a refuge for others? (See also picture.)

Your answer


13 Elders can become a refuge to those in the congregation who endure literal or figurative storms. During disasters and medical emergencies, elders take the initiative to arrange practical assistance. They also offer spiritual help. Brothers and sisters will be inclined to approach an elder if he is known to be gentle, empathetic, and willing to listen. Such qualities help others feel cared for; thus, it is easier for them to apply any Bible-based guidance an elder may provide.​—1 Thess. 2:7, 8, 11.




When literal and figurative storms affect those in the congregation, elders are a refuge (See paragraph 13)a




14. How can we show that we are reliable?

Your answer


14 Be reliable. We want others to be able to count on us, especially during difficult times. (Prov. 17:17) How can we develop a reputation for being reliable? We can strive to display godly qualities consistently, such as by keeping our promises and by doing our best to be punctual. (Matt. 5:37) We can also offer practical help when there is a need. In addition, we make sure that we complete our assignments according to the instructions we receive.
15. How does the congregation benefit when the elders are reliable?

Your answer


15 Reliable elders are a benefit to the congregation. How? Publishers feel supported when they can readily contact elders, such as their field service group overseer. Publishers also feel well cared for when they know that the elders are willing to help them. And as elders base their counsel on the Bible and the publications of the faithful slave rather than on their own opinions, fellow worshippers trust them. Brothers and sisters have further reason to have confidence in an elder who keeps private matters confidential and who follows through by doing what he says he will do.
16. How do we benefit ourselves and others when we are stable?

Your answer


16 Be stable. We can be a good influence on others if we are firm for what is right and if we make decisions that are solidly based on Bible principles. As we grow in faith and accurate knowledge, we become more steadfast in the truth. We are not indecisive, unsteady, or easily swayed by false teachings and worldly thinking. (Eph. 4:14; Jas. 1:6-8) Our faith in Jehovah and in his promises keeps us balanced when we receive bad news. (Ps. 112:7, 8) We are also able to assist those who may be facing trials.​—1 Thess. 3:2, 3.
17. What helps elders to be a stabilizing influence?

Your answer


17 Elders are to be moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, and reasonable. These men are a stabilizing influence on others and strengthen the congregation by “holding firmly to the faithful word.” (Titus 1:9; 1 Tim. 3:1-3) By their example and their shepherding, elders help publishers to be regular in their meeting attendance, field service, and personal study. When brothers and sisters face unsettling events, elders can do much by encouraging them to keep their focus on Jehovah and his purposes.
18. Why do we want to praise Jehovah and draw ever closer to him? (See also the box “A Way to Draw Closer to Jehovah.”)

Your answer


18 After considering Jehovah’s marvelous qualities, we can say as did King David: “May Jehovah, my Rock, be praised.” (Ps. 144:1) Jehovah will never fail to be a God we can rely on. Throughout life, even into old age, we have reason to declare: “He is my Rock,” confident that he will always help us to thrive spiritually.​—Ps. 92:14, 15.
A WAY TO DRAW CLOSER TO JEHOVAH
As a personal study project, you can examine the titles below more closely:
  Almighty​—Gen. 17:1

  Ancient of Days​—Dan. 7:9

  Creator​—Isa. 40:28

  Father​—Isa. 64:8

  Instructor​—Job 36:22; Isa. 30:20

  Shepherd​—Ps. 23:1


The Bible is filled with similar descriptions and titles that help us to deepen our relationship with Jehovah. Use the research tools available in your language to do the following:
  Examine the context. Who said it? What were the circumstances? Why might that description have been used?

  Search the Scriptures. Where else was that description used? What do those accounts have in common?

  Answer the questions. What does the description tell me about Jehovah? How have I seen that Jehovah is worthy of that descriptive title? How does that description affect the way I view Jehovah? How can I apply what I have learned?
