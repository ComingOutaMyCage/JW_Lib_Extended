Many reject the idea that God exists. Often, those who ignore what God requires seem to prosper. When we see that happen, our faith can be tested. While we would not deny that God exists, we could begin to wonder whether he will act in our behalf. The writer of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:0-19:73:28" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 73</a> found himself wondering about this. He saw those around him ignoring God’s laws and still enjoying life. As a result, he began to question whether it was worth serving God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:11-19:73:13" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 73:11-13</a>.</p>

He meditated on what would happen to those who forget Jehovah.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:24-19:73:24" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 73:24</a>) We too can reflect on the blessings that Jehovah has given us. Contrast that with how our life would be if we were not serving Jehovah. Doing so can help us to stick to a faithful course and conclude as did the psalmist: “As for me, drawing near to God is good for me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>.</p>
