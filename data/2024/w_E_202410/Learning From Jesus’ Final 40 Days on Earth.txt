Learning From Jesus’ Final 40 Days on Earth


“He was seen by them throughout 40 days, and he was speaking about the Kingdom of God.”​—ACTS 1:3.


FOCUS
How to imitate the example Jesus set during his final 40 days on earth.


1-2. What happened as two of Jesus’ disciples walked toward Emmaus?

Your answer


IT IS Nisan 16, 33 C.E. Jesus’ disciples are numb with grief and paralyzed by fear. Two of them leave Jerusalem and head for Emmaus, a village about 11 kilometers (7 mi) from Jerusalem. These men are dejected because Jesus, the man they had been following, had just been put to death. Their hope for what the Messiah would do seems lost. But the men are in for a surprise.
2 A stranger approaches and walks with them. The disciples relate their disappointment about what happened to Jesus. The stranger then begins a life-changing discussion with them. “Starting with Moses and all the Prophets,” he explains why the Messiah had to suffer and die. When the three men arrive at Emmaus, the stranger reveals who he is​—the resurrected Jesus! We can only imagine the disciples’ joy on learning that the Messiah was alive!​—Luke 24:13-35.
3-4. What happened to Jesus’ disciples, and what will we learn in this article? (Acts 1:3)

Your answer


3 Jesus appeared to his disciples a number of times throughout his final 40 days on earth. (Read Acts 1:3.) During that time, Jesus’ grief-stricken and fearful followers were transformed into a joyful, confident, and courageous army of Kingdom preachers and teachers.a
4 We can benefit from studying about this thrilling period in Jesus’ life. In this article, we will see how Jesus used this time (1) to encourage his disciples, (2) to deepen their understanding of the Scriptures, and (3) to train them to take on greater responsibilities. In each case, we will see how we can imitate Jesus’ example.
ENCOURAGE OTHERS
 5. Why did Jesus’ disciples need encouragement?

Your answer


5 Jesus’ disciples needed encouragement. Why? Some had left homes, families, and businesses to follow Jesus full-time. (Matt. 19:27) Others were treated as social outcasts because they had become his disciples. (John 9:22) They made these sacrifices because they believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah. (Matt. 16:16) But when Jesus was executed, their hopes were dashed and they became downhearted.
 6. What did Jesus do after he was resurrected?

Your answer


6 No doubt Jesus saw his disciples’ grief, not as a sign of spiritual weakness, but as an understandable response to a terrible loss. So on the very day that he was resurrected, he began encouraging his friends. For instance, he appeared to Mary Magdalene while she wept at his tomb. (John 20:11, 16) He also appeared to the two disciples described at the outset of this article. And he appeared to the apostle Peter. (Luke 24:34) What can we learn from Jesus’ example? Consider what happened during his first appearance.
 7. As reported at John 20:11-16, what did Jesus observe Mary doing early on the morning of Nisan 16, and what did that move him to do? (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 Read John 20:11-16. Early on the morning of Nisan 16, a number of loyal women went to the place where Jesus had been lying lifeless. (Luke 24:1, 10) Let us focus on the experience of one of the women, Mary Magdalene. When Mary arrived at the tomb, she found it empty. She ran to tell Peter and John and then followed them as they raced to the tomb. After confirming that the tomb was empty, the men returned home. But not Mary. She stayed there, weeping. Little did she know that Jesus was watching. He observed this faithful woman’s tears and was deeply moved. So he appeared to Mary and then did something simple that greatly encouraged her. He spoke to her and gave her an important assignment​—to share the news of his resurrection with his brothers.​—John 20:17, 18.




Imitate Jesus by being observant and by empathizing with those who are discouraged (See paragraph 7)




 8. How can we imitate Jesus?

Your answer


8 How can we imitate Jesus? We can do much to motivate our brothers and sisters to keep serving Jehovah if, like Jesus, we are aware of their distresses and speak to them with empathy. Consider the experience of a sister named Jocelyn, whose sister died in a tragic accident. “For many months, I was in a constant state of deep grief,” she says. However, a brother and his wife invited her to their home, listened to her empathetically, and reassured her of her value in God’s eyes. Jocelyn says: “I felt as if Jehovah had used them to pull me out of a dark stormy sea and into a lifeboat. They helped me to regain my desire to keep serving Jehovah.” We too can encourage others by listening attentively as they pour out their heart and by speaking empathetically, with a view to strengthening them in their service to God.​—Rom. 12:15.
REASON ON THE SCRIPTURES
 9. What challenge did Jesus’ disciples face, and how did Jesus help them?

Your answer


9 Jesus’ disciples accepted God’s Word and tried hard to apply it in their life. (John 17:6) Still, Jesus’ dying as a criminal on a torture stake confused them. Jesus realized that their doubts stemmed, not from a bad heart, but from a lack of understanding. (Luke 9:44, 45; John 20:9) So he taught them to reason on the Scriptures. Consider how he did that when he appeared to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus.
10. How did Jesus convince his disciples that he truly was the Messiah? (Luke 24:18-27)

Your answer


10 Read Luke 24:18-27. Notice that Jesus did not immediately tell the men who he was. Instead, he asked questions. Why? Perhaps he wanted them to express what was on their mind and in their heart. And they did. They told him that they had expected Jesus to deliver Israel from Roman oppression. After they clearly expressed their concerns, Jesus used the Scriptures to help the men to understand what had happened.b Later that evening, Jesus spent time assuring the other disciples of these truths. (Luke 24:33-48) What can we learn from this account?
11-12. (a) What lesson can we learn from the way Jesus taught Bible truths? (See also pictures.) (b) How did Nortey’s Bible teacher help him?

Your answers


11 How can we imitate Jesus? First, when teaching Bible students, ask tactful questions that will draw out what is in their mind and heart. (Prov. 20:5) Once you understand their feelings, show them how to find specific scriptures that apply to their circumstances. Then resist the urge to tell them what to do. Instead, help them to reason on the Scriptures and to discern how they can apply Bible principles in their life. Consider the experience of a brother in Ghana named Nortey.
12 When Nortey was 16 years old, he began to study the Bible. Soon, though, his family opposed him. What helped him to remain firm? His Bible teacher had used Matthew chapter 10 to explain that true Christians will be persecuted. “So when the persecution started,” Nortey says, “I was convinced that I had found the truth.” His teacher also helped him to reason on Matthew 10:16 so that he could be both cautious and respectful when discussing religious matters at home. After his baptism, Nortey wanted to pioneer, but his father expected him to go to university. Rather than tell Nortey what to do, his teacher drew him out with questions and helped him to reason on Scriptural principles. The result? Nortey decided to enter full-time service. His father made him leave home. How does Nortey feel about these events? “I am convinced that I made the right choice,” he says. When we too take time to help others reason on the Scriptures, we can help them become solid Christians.​—Eph. 3:16-19.




Imitate Jesus by helping others to reason on the Scriptures (See paragraph 11)e




HELP MEN QUALIFY TO BECOME “GIFTS IN MEN”
13. What did Jesus do to make sure that his Father’s work continued to be cared for? (Ephesians 4:8)

Your answer


13 While on earth, Jesus perfectly cared for the work his Father had given him to do. (John 17:4) But Jesus did not have the attitude, ‘If you want something done right, you must do it yourself.’ During his three-and-a-half-year ministry, he trained others to do the work. Before returning to heaven, Jesus entrusted his disciples​—some of whom may have been in their 20’s—​with the responsibility of caring for Jehovah’s precious sheep and taking the lead in the preaching and teaching work. (Read Ephesians 4:8.) How did Jesus use his final 40 days to help these dedicated, loyal, and hardworking men to qualify to become “gifts in men”?​—See study note on Ephesians 4:8.
14. How did Jesus help his disciples to grow spiritually during his final 40 days on earth? (See also picture.)

Your answer


14 Jesus gave his disciples frank but loving counsel. For example, he noticed that some of them had the tendency to doubt, so he counseled them. (Luke 24:25-27; John 20:27) He drove home the need for them to put greater emphasis on the shepherding work than on their secular careers. (John 21:15) He reminded them not to become unduly concerned about what privileges others might receive in Jehovah’s service. (John 21:20-22) And he corrected some wrong ideas they had about the Kingdom and helped them focus on getting the good news preached. (Acts 1:6-8) What can elders learn from Jesus?




Imitate Jesus by helping men to qualify for additional responsibilities (See paragraph 14)




15-16. (a) In what ways can elders imitate Jesus? Explain. (b) How did Patrick benefit from counsel?

Your answers


15 How can elders imitate Jesus? They must train and assist men, including those who may be relatively young, to qualify for greater responsibilities.c Elders do not expect those whom they train to be perfect. They should give them loving counsel so that these young brothers can gain experience and see the need to be humble, faithful, and willing to serve others.​—1 Tim. 3:1; 2 Tim. 2:2; 1 Pet. 5:5.
16 Consider how a brother named Patrick benefited from counsel. As a young person, he tended to speak harshly and to act unkindly, even toward sisters. A mature elder noticed Patrick’s weaknesses and gave him kind but straightforward counsel. “I am glad he did,” says Patrick. “I used to get discouraged when I saw other brothers receiving privileges of service that I wanted. But the elder’s counsel helped me to see the need to focus on humbly serving my brothers and sisters instead of on receiving some position or privilege in the congregation.” As a result, Patrick was appointed as an elder when he was in his early 20’s.​—Prov. 27:9.
17. How did Jesus show that he trusted his disciples?

Your answer


17 Jesus gave his disciples the responsibility not only to preach but also to teach. (See “teaching them” study note on Matthew 28:20.) The disciples may have felt unqualified for that assignment. However, Jesus did not doubt that they could do the work, and he told them so. Expressing complete confidence in them, Jesus said: “Just as the Father has sent me, I also am sending you.”​—John 20:21.
18. How can elders imitate Jesus?

Your answer


18 How can elders imitate Jesus? Experienced elders delegate responsibilities. (Phil. 2:19-22) For example, elders can involve young ones in Kingdom Hall cleaning and maintenance. After delegating a task, they can express their confidence in those selected to carry it out by training them and then trusting them to do the work correctly. A new elder named Matthew says that he truly appreciates experienced elders who train him thoroughly to handle an assignment and then trust him to complete it. He says, “I have benefited when they viewed my mistakes as part of the learning process and then helped me to improve.”d
19. What should we be determined to do?

Your answer


19 Jesus used his final 40 days on earth to encourage, teach, and train others. May we be determined to follow his example closely. (1 Pet. 2:21) He will help us to do so. After all, he promised: “I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”​—Matt. 28:20.
