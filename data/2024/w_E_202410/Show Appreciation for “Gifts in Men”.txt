SONG 103 Shepherds​—Gifts in Men

Show Appreciation for “Gifts in Men”


“When he ascended on high . . . , he gave gifts in men.”​—EPH. 4:8.


FOCUS
How ministerial servants, elders, and circuit overseers help us and how we can show our appreciation for what these faithful men do.


 1. What are some of the gifts that we have received from Jesus?

Your answer


NO HUMAN has ever been as generous as Jesus. When on earth, he freely used his miraculous power to help others. (Luke 9:12-17) He gave the greatest gift of all by laying down his life for us. (John 15:13) Since his resurrection, Jesus has continued to be generous. Just as he promised, he has asked Jehovah to pour out holy spirit to teach and comfort us. (John 14:16, 17, ftn.; 16:13) And by means of our congregation meetings, Jesus continues to equip us to make disciples all over the earth.​—Matt. 28:18-20.
 2. Who are among the “gifts in men” referred to at Ephesians 4:7, 8?

Your answer


2 Consider another one of Jesus’ gifts. The apostle Paul wrote that after Jesus ascended to heaven, “he gave gifts in men.” (Read Ephesians 4:7, 8.) Paul explained that Jesus gave these gifts in order to support the congregation in various ways. (Eph. 1:22, 23; 4:11-13) Today, these “gifts in men” include ministerial servants, congregation elders, and circuit overseers.a Of course, these men are imperfect, so they make mistakes. (Jas. 3:2) But our Lord Jesus Christ uses them to help us; they are his gifts to us.
 3. Illustrate how all of us can support the work of the “gifts in men.”

Your answer


3 Jesus assigned these “gifts in men” to build up the congregation. (Eph. 4:12) But the rest of us can help them to carry out this important responsibility. To illustrate: Some of us are directly involved in the construction of a Kingdom Hall. Others support the work by providing meals, transportation, and other services. Similarly, all of us can support the efforts of ministerial servants, congregation elders, and circuit overseers by what we say and do. Let us consider how we benefit from their hard work and how we can show them and Jesus, who gave us these “gifts in men,” that we appreciate them.
MINISTERIAL SERVANTS PROVIDING “HELPFUL SERVICES”
 4. What were some of the “helpful services” that ministerial servants performed in the first century?

Your answer


4 In the first century, some brothers were appointed as ministerial servants. (1 Tim. 3:8) It seems that they were the ones who performed the “helpful services” that Paul wrote about. (1 Cor. 12:28) Ministerial servants evidently cared for necessary matters so that the elders could focus on teaching and shepherding. For example, ministerial servants may have helped to make copies of the Scriptures or may have purchased materials needed for copying.
 5. What are some of the helpful services that ministerial servants perform today?

Your answer


5 Consider some helpful services that ministerial servants perform in your congregation. (1 Pet. 4:10) They may be assigned to care for congregation accounts or territories, to order literature and make it available to the publishers, to operate audio and video equipment, to serve as attendants, or to help maintain the Kingdom Hall. All these services are necessary for the congregation to function properly. (1 Cor. 14:40) In addition, some ministerial servants handle parts on the Life and Ministry Meeting and deliver public talks. A ministerial servant may also be appointed to assist a group overseer. At times, qualified ministerial servants join elders on shepherding calls.
 6. What are some reasons why we appreciate our hardworking ministerial servants?

Your answer


6 How does the work of ministerial servants benefit the congregation? “Thanks to our ministerial servants, I fully enjoy the meetings,” says Beberly,b a sister in Bolivia. “Because of their work, I can sing, give my comments, listen to talks, and learn from videos and artwork. They care for security and for those connected via videoconference. After the meeting, they take the lead in cleaning, help with the accounts, and make sure that we have the literature we need. I’m grateful for them!” Leslie, who lives in Colombia and whose husband serves as an elder, says: “My husband depends on the ministerial servants to care for various assignments. Without them, he would be even busier, so I’m thankful for their enthusiasm and willing help.” No doubt that expresses how you feel.​—1 Tim. 3:13.
 7. How can we show appreciation for ministerial servants? (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 Although we may feel thankful for ministerial servants, the Bible urges us: “Show yourselves thankful.” (Col. 3:15) Krzysztof, an elder in Finland, shows his gratitude this way, “I send a postcard or a text message in which I quote a scripture and mention a specific way the ministerial servant has encouraged me or why I appreciate his service.” Pascal and Jael, who live in New Caledonia, pray specifically for ministerial servants. Pascal explains, “Lately, our petitions, supplications, and prayers of thanksgiving have been about these appointed brothers in our congregation.” Jehovah hears such prayers, and the whole congregation benefits.​—2 Cor. 1:11.
CONGREGATION ELDERS “WORKING HARD AMONG YOU”
 8. Why could Paul write that elders in the first century were “working hard”? (1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13)

Your answer


8 Elders in the first century worked hard for the congregation. (Read 1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13; 1 Tim. 5:17) They were “presiding over” the congregation​—conducting meetings and making decisions as a body of elders. They were “admonishing” their brothers and sisters​—giving specific yet loving counsel in order to protect the congregation. (1 Thess. 2:11, 12; 2 Tim. 4:2) Of course, these men also worked hard to provide for their families and to keep themselves spiritually strong.​—1 Tim. 3:2, 4; Titus 1:6-9.
 9. What are some responsibilities cared for by elders today?

Your answer


9 Elders today are busy men. They are evangelizers. (2 Tim. 4:5) They take a zealous lead in the field ministry, organize the preaching work in the local territory, and train us to preach and teach effectively. They also serve as merciful, impartial judges. When a Christian commits a serious sin, elders strive to help him repair his friendship with Jehovah. At the same time, they are careful to keep the congregation clean. (1 Cor. 5:12, 13; Gal. 6:1) Primarily, elders are known as shepherds. (1 Pet. 5:1-3) They deliver well-prepared Scriptural talks, endeavor to get to know everyone in the congregation, and make shepherding calls. Some elders also assist with Kingdom Hall construction and maintenance, convention organization, and the work of Hospital Liaison Committees and Patient Visitation Groups, in addition to other assignments. Elders work hard for us!
10. What are some reasons why we appreciate our hardworking elders?

Your answer


10 Jehovah foretold that shepherds would care well for us and that we would “no longer be afraid or be terrified.” (Jer. 23:4) Johanna, a sister in Finland, experienced the truth of those words when her mother faced a serious illness. She relates: “Although I find it difficult to share my feelings with others, an elder whom I didn’t know very well was patient with me, prayed with me, and assured me of Jehovah’s love. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but I remember that I felt safe. I believe that Jehovah sent him to help me at exactly the right moment.” How have the elders in your congregation helped you?
11. How can we show appreciation for the elders? (See also picture.)

Your answer


11 Jehovah wants us to show warm appreciation for the elders “because of their work.” (1 Thess. 5:12, 13) Henrietta, who also lives in Finland, observes: “Elders help others willingly, but this doesn’t mean that they have extra time and energy or that they don’t have challenges in their life. Sometimes I just say to them: ‘Do you know what? You are a really good elder. I hope you know that.’” A sister in Türkiyec named Sera says: “Elders need ‘fuel’ to keep going. So we can write them a card, invite them for a meal, or join them in the field ministry.” Is there an elder whose efforts you especially appreciate? Look for ways to express that appreciation.​—1 Cor. 16:18.




You can provide the “fuel” that helps the appointed brothers to keep going (See paragraphs 7, 11, 15)




CIRCUIT OVERSEERS TO BUILD UP
12. What arrangement built up the congregations in the first century? (1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8)

Your answer


12 Christ Jesus gave the congregation “gifts in men” who serve in another way. Under his direction, the elders in Jerusalem sent out Paul, Barnabas, and others as traveling overseers. (Acts 11:22) Why? For the same reason that ministerial servants and elders were appointed: to build up the congregations. (Acts 15:40, 41) These men sacrificed their comfort and even risked their lives to teach and encourage others.​—Read 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8.
13. What are some responsibilities of circuit overseers?

Your answer


13 Circuit overseers are constantly on the move. Some travel hundreds of kilometers between congregations. Each week, a circuit overseer delivers several talks, goes on shepherding calls, and conducts a pioneer meeting, an elders’ meeting, and meetings for field service. He prepares talks and organizes circuit assemblies and conventions. He teaches pioneer schools, arranges for a special meeting with the pioneers in the circuit, and handles other​—sometimes urgent—​matters assigned to him by the branch office.
14. What are some reasons why we appreciate our hardworking circuit overseers?

Your answer


14 How do congregations benefit from the gift of circuit overseers? Commenting on the visits of traveling overseers, a brother in Türkiye says: “Every one of their visits motivates me to spend more time helping my brothers and sisters. I have met many circuit overseers; yet, not one of them ever seemed unapproachable or gave me the feeling that he was too busy.” Johanna, quoted earlier, worked with a circuit overseer in the ministry, but they found no one at home. “Still,” she says, “I will always remember that day. Both of my sisters had just moved away, and I missed them a lot. The circuit overseer warmly encouraged me and helped me to see that in Jehovah’s service the distances are only temporary but in the new world, we will have endless opportunities to spend time together.” Many circuit overseers have similarly endeared themselves to those whom they serve.​—Acts 20:37–21:1.
15. (a) In harmony with 3 John 5-8, how can we show appreciation for circuit overseers? (See also picture.) (b) Why should we show consideration for the wives of appointed men, and how can we do so? (See the box “Remember Their Wives.”)

Your answers


15 The apostle John encouraged Gaius to show hospitality to visiting brothers and to “send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.” (Read 3 John 5-8.) One way for us to do that is by inviting the circuit overseer for a meal. Another way is by supporting the arrangements for field service during his visit. Leslie, quoted earlier, shows her gratitude in other ways too. “I pray that Jehovah care for their needs,” she says. “My husband and I have also written letters to them, telling them how much their visits have helped us.” Remember, circuit overseers are not superhuman. At times, they suffer from illness, anxiety, and even discouragement. Perhaps your kind words or a modest gift will be the answer to your circuit overseer’s prayer for help!​—Prov. 12:25.
Remember Their Wives
The wives of ministerial servants, elders, and circuit overseers often make sacrifices so that these men can help the congregation. “It is as if they lend their husbands to Jehovah,” says one sister. “I am sure that he looks on them as his precious daughters.” What can we do to show our gratitude for these unselfish sisters?
  Thank them. A simple “Thank you for sharing your husband with the congregation” can mean a lot.

  Show them consideration. Feel free to approach an appointed brother with your concerns; yet, remember that he may at times need to give priority to his family. (1 Tim. 3:4, 5, 12) He needs to spend time alone with his wife and children in the ministry, in family worship, and in recreation.

  Pray for them. Just as their husbands are “gifts in men,” so too “discreet [wives are] from Jehovah.” (Prov. 19:14) Thank Jehovah for these sisters, and ask him to strengthen them.




WE NEED “GIFTS IN MEN”
16. In harmony with Proverbs 3:27, what questions might brothers ask themselves?

Your answer


16 Around the world, we need more brothers to serve as “gifts in men.” If you are a baptized brother, is it “within your power to help”? (Read Proverbs 3:27.) Are you willing to qualify as a ministerial servant? Could you reach out to care for the needs of your brothers as an elder?d Are you able to adjust your circumstances to apply for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers? That school will equip you to be used even more fully by Jesus. If you feel unqualified, pray to Jehovah. Ask him for the help of his holy spirit to handle successfully any assignment you are given.​—Luke 11:13; Acts 20:28.
17. What do “gifts in men” prove about our King, Christ Jesus?

Your answer


17 The brothers whom Jesus has appointed as “gifts in men” are proof that he has been leading us during these last days. (Matt. 28:20) Are you not grateful that we have a King who is loving, generous, and attentive and who provides qualified brothers to care for our needs? Then look for opportunities to show your appreciation for these hardworking men. And never fail to thank Jehovah, who is the ultimate Source of “every good gift and every perfect present.”​—Jas. 1:17.
