<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Have you ever struggled to remember what you just studied? That happens to all of us from time to time. What can help? Reviewing the main points.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">As you study, pause periodically to note the most important ideas. Notice how the apostle Paul helped those considering his letter to do this when he wrote: “Now this is the main point.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 8:1</a>) With those words, he helped his listeners to follow his logic and to discern how each point related to his theme.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">You might reserve time, perhaps ten minutes at the end of your study period, to reflect on the main points of what you have studied. If you cannot recall them, check the subheadings or topic sentences​—usually the first sentence of each paragraph—​to jog your memory. If you learned something new, try to explain it in your own words. As you review the main points, you will not only help your memory but also see more clearly how the material relates to your own life.</p>
