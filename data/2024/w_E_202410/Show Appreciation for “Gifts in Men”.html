Another way is by supporting the arrangements for field service during his visit. <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Leslie, quoted earlier, shows her gratitude in other ways too. “I pray that Jehovah care for their needs,” she says. “My husband and I have also written letters to them, telling them how much their visits have helped us.” Remember, circuit overseers are not superhuman. At times, they suffer from illness, anxiety, and even discouragement. Perhaps your kind words or a modest gift will be the answer to your circuit overseer’s prayer for help!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>.</p>
