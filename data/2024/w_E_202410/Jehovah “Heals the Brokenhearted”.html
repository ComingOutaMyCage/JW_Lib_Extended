Because of painful emotions, you may not feel like interacting with others. At times, your brothers and sisters may misunderstand you or fail to choose the right words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) Do not let such challenges prevent you from receiving the encouragement you need. An elder named Gavin, who suffers from depression, says: “Keeping in touch with friends is often the last thing I feel like doing.” Nevertheless, Gavin does not give in to his feelings, and he benefits from his association with others. A sister named Amy says: “Because of my past experiences, I have difficulty trusting people. But I am learning to love and trust my brothers and sisters as Jehovah does. I know that this makes Jehovah happy, and it makes me happy too.”</p>
