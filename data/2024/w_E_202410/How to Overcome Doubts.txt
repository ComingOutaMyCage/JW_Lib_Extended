How to Overcome Doubts


“Make sure of all things.”​—1 THESS. 5:21.


FOCUS
How to resolve unsettling doubts that could affect our service to Jehovah.


1-2. (a) What are some doubts that servants of Jehovah may experience? (b) What will we consider in this article?

Your answers


PEOPLE of all ages have doubtsa at times. For example, imagine a young Witness who wonders if Jehovah is really interested in him. He may be unsure about getting baptized. Or think about a middle-aged brother who in his youth chose to pursue Kingdom interests rather than a career in this world. With the family budget now stretched to the limit, he may be having second thoughts. Picture an elderly sister with limited strength and energy. She may feel discouraged because she can no longer do what she once did. Have you ever asked yourself such questions as: ‘Does Jehovah really notice me? Have the sacrifices that I have made for Jehovah been worth it? Am I still useful to Jehovah?’
2 If we leave questions like these unanswered, they can adversely affect our worship. In this article, we will consider how focusing on Bible principles can help us if we doubt (1) that Jehovah is interested in us, (2) that our past decisions were sound, or (3) that we are still useful to Jehovah.
HOW TO RESOLVE YOUR DOUBTS
 3. What is one way that we can resolve our doubts?

Your answer


3 One way that we can resolve our doubts is by turning to God’s Word to find answers to our questions. If we do so, we will be strengthened, grow spiritually, and be better equipped to “stand firm in the faith.”​—1 Cor. 16:13.
 4. How do we “make sure of all things”? (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

Your answer


4 Read 1 Thessalonians 5:21. Note that the Bible urges us to “make sure of all things.” How can we do this? We can make sure that what we believe is true by comparing it with what the Bible says. For example, consider the case of the young person who wonders whether he has any value in God’s eyes. Should he simply accept that thought as true? No, he should “make sure of all things” by getting Jehovah’s thoughts on the matter.
 5. How do we “hear” Jehovah’s answers to our questions?

Your answer


5 As we read God’s Word, we “hear” Jehovah speaking to us. But to get his thoughts on a specific question requires effort on our part. We need to focus our Bible reading on the topic that concerns us. We can do research on that subject, using the extensive study tools that Jehovah’s organization provides. (Prov. 2:3-6) We can pray that Jehovah will guide our research and help us to find his thoughts on our question. Then we can look for Bible principles and practical information that apply to our situation. We may also benefit by considering Bible accounts of those who faced a similar situation.
 6. What part do meetings play in helping us to overcome our doubts?

Your answer


6 We also “hear” Jehovah speaking to us at our meetings. If we regularly attend the meetings, we could hear something in a talk or in a comment from someone in the audience that is just what we need to overcome our doubts. (Prov. 27:17) Let us now consider how to resolve some specific doubts.
WHEN YOU DOUBT THAT JEHOVAH IS INTERESTED IN YOU
 7. What question might some ask?

Your answer


7 Have you ever wondered, ‘Does Jehovah really notice me?’ If you feel insignificant, the thought of becoming friends with the Creator of the universe could seem unrealistic, way beyond your reach. A similar thought may have occurred to King David. He marveled that Jehovah was even aware of mere humans and asked: “O Jehovah, what is man that you should notice him, the son of mortal man that you should pay attention to him?” (Ps. 144:3) Where can you turn to answer this question?
 8. According to 1 Samuel 16:6, 7, 10-12, what does Jehovah notice in people?

Your answer


8 From the Bible, we learn that Jehovah notices those who seem unimportant to others. For example, Jehovah sent Samuel to the house of Jesse to anoint one of his sons as the future king of Israel. Jesse called seven of his eight sons to meet Samuel but did not include David, the youngest.b Yet, it was David whom Jehovah chose. (Read 1 Samuel 16:6, 7, 10-12.) Jehovah saw who David really was on the inside​—a young man who valued spiritual things.
 9. Why can you be sure that Jehovah is interested in you? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 Think about how Jehovah has already shown that he notices you. He offers to give you advice tailored to fit your needs. (Ps. 32:8) How can he do that unless he knows you well? (Ps. 139:1) When you apply Jehovah’s advice and see how it helps you, you will become convinced that Jehovah is interested in you. (1 Chron. 28:9; Acts 17:26, 27) Jehovah takes note of your efforts. He sees your inner qualities and is moved to reach out to you. (Jer. 17:10) He wants you to respond to his offer to be your Friend.​—1 John 4:19.




“If you search for [Jehovah], he will let himself be found by you.”​—1 Chron. 28:9 (See paragraph 9)c




WHEN YOU DOUBT THAT YOUR PAST DECISIONS WERE WISE
10. When we think about our past decisions, what questions might arise?

Your answer


10 Later in life, some could think back and wonder whether they made the right decisions. Perhaps they decided to give up a promising career or a successful business in order to serve Jehovah more fully. Now time has passed, perhaps even decades. They may see acquaintances who pursued secular interests and who now enjoy apparent financial security. As a result, they may wonder: ‘Were the sacrifices I made for Jehovah worth it? Or did they cause me to miss other opportunities?’
11. What troubled the writer of Psalm 73?

Your answer


11 If similar questions bother you, consider how the writer of Psalm 73 felt. He saw others enjoying what looked like a healthy, prosperous, and stress-free life. (Ps. 73:3-5, 12) As he observed them and their apparent success, he felt that his efforts to serve Jehovah were pointless. He was “troubled all day long” by this discouraging thought. (Ps. 73:13, 14) How did he deal with his troubled feelings?
12. According to Psalm 73:16-18, how did the writer resolve his concerns?

Your answer


12 Read Psalm 73:16-18. The psalmist went to the peaceful setting of Jehovah’s sanctuary. There, he was able to think clearly. He discerned that even though the life of some might seem easy, their long-term future was precarious. With this insight, he found peace of mind, knowing that pursuing spiritual things was the very best decision. As a result, he renewed his determination to continue serving Jehovah.​—Ps. 73:23-28.
13. How can you find peace of mind if you are uncertain about past decisions? (See also picture.)

Your answer


13 You can find similar peace of mind with the help of God’s Word. How? Contemplate the value of what you have​—including treasures in heaven—​and compare this to the outcome for those whose only reward is what this world has to offer. They may completely rely on their achievements in this life because they anticipate nothing else in the future. For you, however, Jehovah promises blessings far beyond anything you could ever imagine. (Ps. 145:16) Also, consider this: Can we ever really know how our life would have turned out if we had made different decisions? One thing is certain: Those who make choices based on their love of God and love of neighbor never miss out on anything that is truly good.




Look ahead to the blessings that Jehovah has promised (See paragraph 13)d




WHEN YOU DOUBT THAT YOU ARE USEFUL TO JEHOVAH
14. Why do some lack confidence, and what question might bother them?

Your answer


14 Some of Jehovah’s servants are feeling the effects of old age, struggling with poor health, or living with a disability. That may cause them to feel uncertain of their worth in Jehovah’s eyes. They may ask, ‘Am I still useful to Jehovah?’
15. Of what was the writer of Psalm 71 convinced?

Your answer


15 The writer of Psalm 71 expressed a similar concern. He prayed: “Do not abandon me when my strength fails.” (Ps. 71:9, 18) Nevertheless, the psalmist remained convinced that if he served his God loyally, Jehovah would guide and support him. As the psalmist learned, Jehovah finds pleasure in those who do their best to serve Him despite their limitations.​—Ps. 37:23-25.
16. In what ways are older ones useful to Jehovah? (Psalm 92:12-15)

Your answer


16 Older ones, see your situation from Jehovah’s viewpoint. He can help you to thrive spiritually even though you may be struggling physically. (Read Psalm 92:12-15.) Rather than focus on what you are no longer able to do, concentrate on what you can do. For example, you can strengthen others by your faithful example and the personal interest you show. You can talk about how Jehovah has sustained you over the years and share your strong hope in the fulfillment of his promises. And never underestimate how much good your heartfelt prayers can achieve in behalf of others. (1 Pet. 3:12) No matter what our circumstances are, all of us have something to offer to Jehovah and to others.
17. Why should we resist the urge to compare ourselves with others?

Your answer


17 If you feel frustrated that you cannot do more in Jehovah’s service, be assured that he treasures whatever you can accomplish. You may have the urge to compare what you do with what others can do. Resist that urge! Why? Because Jehovah does not make such comparisons. (Gal. 6:4) For example, Mary gave Jesus a gift of costly perfumed oil. (John 12:3-5) In contrast, the needy widow contributed to the temple two small coins of very little monetary value. (Luke 21:1-4) Yet, Jesus saw both gifts as expressions of faith. His Father, Jehovah, truly values anything you do that is motivated by your devotion to him and love for him, however small it may seem to you.
18. What will help us to overcome our doubts? (See also the box “Jehovah’s Word Can Help You to Overcome Doubts.”)

Your answer


18 We all have doubts at times. As we have seen, however, God’s reliable Word of truth, the Bible, can help us to fight them off. So work to resolve your doubts, and let confidence replace your concern. Jehovah certainly notices you as an individual. He appreciates your sacrifices and is committed to rewarding you. Be assured that Jehovah views all his loyal servants as worthy of his love and attention.
