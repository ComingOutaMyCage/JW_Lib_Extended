For example, imagine a young Witness who wonders if Jehovah is really interested in him. He may be unsure about getting baptized. Or think about a middle-aged brother who in his youth chose to pursue Kingdom interests rather than a career in this world. With the family budget now stretched to the limit, he may be having second thoughts. Picture an elderly sister with limited strength and energy. She may feel discouraged because she can no longer do what she once did. Have you ever asked yourself such questions as: ‘Does Jehovah really notice me? Have the sacrifices that I have made for Jehovah been worth it? Am I still useful to Jehovah?’</p>
