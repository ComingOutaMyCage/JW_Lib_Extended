Two of them leave Jerusalem and head for Emmaus, a village about 11 kilometers (7 mi) from Jerusalem. These men are dejected because Jesus, the man they had been following, had just been put to death. Their hope for what the Messiah would do seems lost. But the men are in for a surprise.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> A stranger approaches and walks with them. The disciples relate their disappointment about what happened to Jesus. The stranger then begins a life-changing discussion with them. “Starting with Moses and all the Prophets,” he explains why the Messiah had to suffer and die. When the three men arrive at Emmaus, the stranger reveals who he is​—the resurrected Jesus!

But not Mary. She stayed there, weeping. Little did she know that Jesus was watching. He observed this faithful woman’s tears and was deeply moved.

Consider the experience of a sister named Jocelyn, whose sister died in a tragic accident. “For many months, I was in a constant state of deep grief,” she says. However, a brother and his wife invited her to their home, listened to her empathetically, and reassured her of her value in God’s eyes. Jocelyn says: “I felt as if Jehovah had used them to pull me out of a dark stormy sea and into a lifeboat. They helped me to regain my desire to keep serving Jehovah.” We too can encourage others by listening attentively as they pour out their heart and by speaking empathetically, with a view to strengthening them in their service to God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:15-45:12:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 12:15</a>.</p>

His Bible teacher had used <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:1-40:10:42" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 10</a> to explain that true Christians will be persecuted. “So when the persecution started,” Nortey says, “I was convinced that I had found the truth.” His teacher also helped him to reason on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 10:16</a> so that he could be both cautious and respectful when discussing religious matters at home. After his baptism, Nortey wanted to pioneer, but his father expected him to go to university. Rather than tell Nortey what to do, his teacher drew him out with questions and helped him to reason on Scriptural principles. The result? Nortey decided to enter full-time service. His father made him leave home. How does Nortey feel about these events? “I am convinced that I made the right choice,” he says. When we too take time to help others reason on the Scriptures, we can help them become solid Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:16-49:3:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 3:16-19</a>.</p>

The disciples may have felt unqualified for that assignment. However, Jesus did not doubt that they could do the work, and he told them so.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:19-50:2:22" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Phil. 2:19-22</a>) For example, elders can involve young ones in Kingdom Hall cleaning and maintenance. After delegating a task, they can express their confidence in those selected to carry it out by training them and then trusting them to do the work correctly. A new elder named Matthew says that he truly appreciates experienced elders who train him thoroughly to handle an assignment and then trust him to complete it. He says, “I have benefited when they viewed my mistakes as part of the learning process and then helped me to improve.”<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
