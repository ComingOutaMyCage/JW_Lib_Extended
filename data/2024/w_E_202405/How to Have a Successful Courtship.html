And for many couples, it does. Tsion,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> a sister from Ethiopia, says: “One of the happiest times of my life was when my husband and I dated. We had serious discussions, and we also laughed. I was happy when I realized that I had found someone I love and who loves me.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> However, Alessio, a brother from the Netherlands, says, “It was enjoyable to get to know my wife when we were dating, but our courtship also had challenges.” In this article, we will discuss some potential challenges and some Bible principles that can help couples to have a successful courtship. We will also consider how others in the congregation can support courting couples.</p>
<h2 class="du-color--coolGray-700 du-textAlign--center" id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>THE PURPOSE OF COURTSHIP</strong></h2>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong> What is the purpose of courtship? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:25-20:20:25" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:25</a>)</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Although courtship can be enjoyable, it is also a serious step that may lead to marriage. On their wedding day, a couple vow before Jehovah to love and respect each other for as long as they both live. Before making any vow, we should consider the matter very carefully. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:25-20:20:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 20:25</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> That is certainly true of the marriage vow. Courtship allows a couple to get to know each other and to make a good decision. Sometimes that decision is to get married; sometimes that decision is <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>to end the courtship. If a couple break up, this does not mean that their courtship failed. Instead, the courtship served its purpose​—it helped them come to a good decision.</p>

</div>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Why is it important to have the right view of courtship? When single people have the proper viewpoint, they will not date someone they have no intention of marrying. Single people, however, are not the only ones who need to have the right perspective. <strong><em>All</em></strong> of us should develop it. For example, some think that if a couple are dating, they must get married. How does this attitude affect single Christians? Melissa, a single sister in the United States, says: “There is a lot of pressure on Witnesses who are dating. As a result, some courting couples avoid ending a relationship that is not working. Other single ones avoid dating altogether. The pressure can be overwhelming.”</p>

Get to know each other <strong><em>well.</em></strong> You likely learned some things about the other person before you began dating. But now you have the opportunity to get to know “the secret person of the heart.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:4-60:3:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 3:4</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> This involves learning more about your prospective mate’s spirituality, personality, and thinking. Over time, you should be able to answer such questions as: ‘Will this person be a good marriage mate for me?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:26-20:31:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 31:26, 27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:30-20:31:30" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Eph. 5:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:8</a>) ‘Can we fulfill each other’s emotional needs?

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> What other matters should you learn <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>about the other person during courtship? Before you become too emotionally involved, you may want to discuss some important matters, such as the other person’s goals. But what about such personal matters as health issues, financial problems, or past trauma? Not all topics need to be discussed at the beginning of the courtship. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:12-43:16:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 16:12</a>.) If you feel that it is too soon to answer some particularly personal questions, let the other person know. Nevertheless, in time your prospective mate will need to know this information in order to make a balanced decision. So at some point, you will have to open up.</p>

One of the best ways is to talk openly and honestly, to ask questions and really listen.

You can also learn about each other when you spend time with friends and family. Additionally, plan activities that will show you how the other person acts in different circumstances and with different people. Note what Aschwin, from the Netherlands, tried to do. He says about his courtship with Alicia: “We looked for activities that would help us learn about each other. Often these were simple things, such as preparing a meal together or doing chores together. During such activities, we saw each other’s strengths and weaknesses.”</p>

You can still focus on talking and listening to each other. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to learn some things about each other without spending time together in person. So visit each other when possible. You will also have additional factors to consider. For example: Are you willing and able to move and possibly adapt to another culture or language? Can you handle the expenses of traveling to see each other during courtship and to visit the other person’s family and friends even afterward?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:28-42:14:28" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 14:28</a>.</p>

If you get married, you will need to make time for family worship, so that God is an essential part of your marriage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:12-21:4:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eccl. 4:12</a>) So why not schedule time to study together now, during your <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>courtship? Of course, a courting couple are not a family yet, and the brother is not the sister’s head yet. Nevertheless, by studying together regularly, you can learn about each other’s spirituality. Max and Laysa, a couple from the United States, found another benefit. He says: “Early in our courtship, we started studying publications on the subjects of dating, marriage, and family life. Those publications opened the door to conversations on many important matters that would not have come up naturally.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:27-20:17:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 17:27</a>) By doing so, you may avoid unnecessary pressure and questions. However, if you do not tell anyone, you might end up isolating yourselves for fear that others will find out. This can be dangerous. So it would be wise at least to inform those who can provide good advice and practical assistance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:22-20:15:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 15:22</a>) For example, you could tell certain family members, mature friends, or Christian elders.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:19-20:20:19" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 20:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:10" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Rom. 14:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:11-52:4:11" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 4:11</a>) Furthermore, the couple may not appreciate comments or questions implying that they should or will get married. A sister named Elise and her husband recall, “We found it awkward when others asked us about our wedding plans when we hadn’t discussed them yet.”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[68]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> What if a couple decide to end the courtship? We should avoid prying into the matter or taking sides. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:15-60:4:15" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:15</a>) A sister named Lea says: “I heard that others had been speculating about why a brother and I broke up. I was really hurt.” As mentioned earlier, a breakup does not necessarily mean that the couple failed. Usually, it simply means that the courtship achieved its purpose​—it helped the couple come to a good decision. However, that decision may still have caused them emotional pain and may have left them feeling alone. So we can look for ways to support them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>.</p>

Jessica recalls: “Quite honestly, courtship was a lot of work. But it was 100 percent worth the time and energy.” If you are a courting couple, continue working on getting to know each other well. If you do, you will have a successful courtship​—one that will help you both to make a wise decision.</p>
