(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:128:1-19:128:1" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 128:1</a>) So if you want to get married but have not yet found someone, continue focusing on your service to Jehovah. A sister from Macao named Sin Yi says: “Compared with the time you could spend with your spouse in Paradise, the time being single is relatively short. Treasure that time, and make good use of it.” But what if you have found a potential mate and have begun courting? In the next article, we will discuss how you can have a successful courtship.</p>

In some countries, it is also referred to as dating, getting to know someone, or a romantic relationship. Courtship begins when a man and a woman make clear that they are romantically interested in each other, and it continues until either they make a commitment to get married or they end the courtship.</p></div>
