Through an angel, God told Abraham that He was going to wipe out the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. That faithful man was troubled. He asked: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? . . . Will the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?” Jehovah patiently taught his beloved human friend a lesson that benefits and comforts us all: God will <strong><em>never</em></strong> destroy righteous people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:23-1:18:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 18:23-33</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[50]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider a number of related questions. Several Bible accounts describe Jehovah’s judgments against unrighteous people, such as the unknown numbers who died in the Flood or the seven nations in the Promised Land that Jehovah ordered his people to devote to destruction or the 185,000 Assyrian soldiers slain by an angel of Jehovah in a single night. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:23-1:7:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 7:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:1-5:7:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Deut. 7:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:36-23:37:37" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa. 37:36, 37</a>) In these cases, does the Bible give us enough information to determine that Jehovah sentenced all those individuals to <strong><em>eternal</em></strong> destruction, with no hope of a resurrection? No, it does not. Why can we say that?</p>

A righteous man named Lot lived in their midst. But do we know that Lot preached to all of them? No. They were certainly wicked, but did they all know any better? Recall that a crowd of men in that city sought to rape Lot’s guests. The Bible says that the mob ranged “from boy to old man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:4-1:19:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 19:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:7-61:2:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:7</a>) Do we really know that the merciful God, Jehovah, condemned each one to death with no hope of a resurrection?

King Solomon is an example. He was thoroughly instructed in God’s ways and greatly blessed by Jehovah; yet, he later turned to worshipping false gods.

True, the Scriptures do say that Solomon “was laid to rest with his forefathers,” including such faithful men as King David.

Resurrection is a gift from a loving God. He bestows it on those whom he wants to give an opportunity to serve him forever.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:14-40:10:15" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 10:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:23-40:11:24" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 11:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:12-42:10:12" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Luke 10:12</a>) What did he mean? We might assume that Jesus was using hyperbole on this occasion. But that does not seem to be the case, any more than when he was speaking of the Ninevites.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Rather, it seems that Jesus meant what he said. The “Judgment Day” he referred to in both instances was surely the same. Like the Ninevites, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did bad things. But the Ninevites had an opportunity to repent. Further, remember what Jesus said about the “resurrection of judgment.” It will include “those who practiced vile things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:29-43:5:29" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 5:29</a>) So it seems that there may be some hope for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is possible that at least some of those people will be resurrected, and we may have the opportunity to teach them about Jehovah and Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p78" data-pid="78">Decades after Jesus died, his half brother Jude wrote that Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them had undergone “the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:7-65:1:7" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Jude 7</a>) What did Jude mean? Was he contradicting Jesus’ message? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:12-42:10:12" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Luke 10:12</a>) No. Jesus did not say that everyone in Sodom and Gomorrah would be resurrected. Rather, he suggested that there was hope for at least some of them. It seems that the cities themselves, rather than all their inhabitants, were everlastingly destroyed as a dramatic warning against immoral conduct. What Jude wrote was in harmony with what the prophet Jeremiah had said when he explained that those wicked cities were just like ancient Edom and Babylon, which were destroyed forever, never to be rebuilt or inhabited again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:17-24:49:18" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Jer. 49:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:35-24:50:35" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 50:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:39-24:50:40" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> 39, 40</a>) Additionally, both Jude and the apostle Peter allowed for the possibility that some of those people whom God had destroyed will not be resurrected.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:6-61:2:6" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:6</a>.</p>
