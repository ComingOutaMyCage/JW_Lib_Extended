However, we must recognize that there are some things that we just <strong><em>do not</em></strong> know about the near future. In this article, we will first discuss why we have reconsidered what we have said about some of those events.

We came to that conclusion because we understood that the account of the Flood was a prophetic type. For example, we reasoned that just as Jehovah shut the door of the ark prior to the start of the Flood, he would, at the beginning of the great tribulation, “shut the door” on Satan’s system of things, thus preventing any more people from being saved.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37-39</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider what Jesus said about the scope of our preaching work. He foretold that the good news would be preached “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) That prophecy is being fulfilled today as never before. The Kingdom message is published in more than 1,000 languages, and by means of the jw.org website, it is available to the majority of the world’s population.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> However, Jesus also told his disciples that they would not “complete the circuit of the cities,” or preach to everyone, before he would come.

Millions of people today live in areas where the preaching work is severely restricted. In addition, hundreds of babies are born every minute. We do our best to reach people from “every nation and tribe and tongue” with the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6</a>) But the fact is that we will not be able to share the good news with each individual on earth before the end comes.</p>

In fact, he knows us so well as individuals that should we die, he can re-create every unique detail and restore every memory that makes us who we are! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:29-40:10:31" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matt. 10:29-31</a>) Surely, we have good reason to be confident that our loving heavenly Father will judge each individual in a perfectly balanced, righteous, and merciful way.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:13-59:2:13" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Jas. 2:13</a>.</p>
