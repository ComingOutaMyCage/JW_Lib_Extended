Enduring Injustice




Read Genesis 37:23-28; 39:17-23 to learn from Joseph’s experience about enduring injustice.
Analyze the context. What led up to Joseph’s unfair treatment? (Gen. 37:3-11; 39:1, 6-10) How long did Joseph have to endure injustice? (Gen. 37:2; 41:46) During that time, what did Jehovah do for Joseph, but what did He not do?​—Gen. 39:2, 21; w23.01 17 ¶13.
Dig deeper. The Bible does not say that Joseph defended himself against the false accusation of Potiphar’s wife. How might the following scriptures help us to reason on why Joseph might have chosen to remain silent or on why we need not expect all details to be revealed? (Prov. 20:2; John 21:25; Acts 21:37) What qualities may have helped Joseph endure injustice?​—Mic. 7:7; Luke 14:11; Jas. 1:2, 3.
Identify the lessons. Ask yourself:
  ‘What unjust treatment can I expect to face as a disciple of Jesus?’ (Luke 21:12, 16, 17; Heb. 10:33, 34)

  ‘How can I prepare to deal with injustice successfully?’ (Ps. 62:7, 8; 105:17-19; w19.07 2-7)
