We learned, for example, that some individuals may have an opportunity to side with Jehovah’s people even <strong><em>after</em></strong> Babylon the Great is destroyed. We also learned that as of November 2023, Kingdom publishers would no longer be asked to report all their activity in the ministry. Do such changes make our ministry less important, less urgent than before? Absolutely not!</p>

Why? Because time is running out. Consider what Jesus foretold about the preaching work in the last days. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 13:10</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> According to Matthew’s parallel account, Jesus said that the good news would be preached in all the inhabited earth before <strong><em>“the end”</em></strong> comes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) That expression refers to the complete end of Satan’s wicked system of things. Jehovah has set the “day and hour” for the events that will soon unfold. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:13-40:25:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:7-44:1:7" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Acts 1:7</a>) Each day brings us <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>one day closer to that time.

Ernest recalls: “I wondered: ‘Has he gone to heaven? Or has he ceased to exist forever?’ I envied other children who still had a father.” Ernest would regularly go to the cemetery, kneel at his father’s grave, and pray: “Please, God, I want to know where my dad is.” About 17 years after his father died, Ernest was offered a Bible study, which he readily accepted. He was thrilled to learn that the dead are unconscious, as if in a deep sleep, and that the Bible promises a future resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>) Finally, he found the answers to the questions that had troubled him for so long! Ernest was very excited about the Bible truths he was learning. His wife, Rose, joined him in the study and shared his love for the Kingdom message. In 1978 they got baptized. They eagerly shared their treasured beliefs with family, friends, and any others who would listen. As a result, Ernest and Rose have helped more than 70 individuals to progress to baptism.</p>

Consider an illustration. If you needed someone to be <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>a character witness for you in a court case, you would choose someone you know and trust, someone whose reputation would make his testimony trustworthy. By choosing us to be his Witnesses, Jehovah shows that he knows us well and that he trusts us to testify that he is the only true God. We feel so honored to be his Witnesses that we seize every opportunity to make his name known and to combat the many lies that have been told about him. By doing so, we live up to the name that we are so proud to bear, Jehovah’s Witnesses!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Rom. 10:13-15</a>.</p>
