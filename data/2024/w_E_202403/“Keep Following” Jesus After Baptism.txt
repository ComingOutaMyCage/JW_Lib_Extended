“Keep Following” Jesus After Baptism


“If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me.”​—LUKE 9:23.


FOCUS
This article can help all of us to reflect on the meaning of our dedication. In particular, it can help those who recently got baptized to remain faithful.


1-2. How does life get better after baptism?

Your answer


IT IS a joy to get baptized and become part of Jehovah’s family. Those who are in that privileged position would agree with the words of the psalmist David, who said: “Happy is the one whom you [Jehovah] choose and bring near to reside in your courtyards.”​—Ps. 65:4.
2 Jehovah does not bring just anyone into his courtyards. As discussed in the preceding article, he chooses to draw close to those who prove that they want to have a close relationship with him. (Jas. 4:8) When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah and get baptized, you draw closer to Jehovah in a special way. You can be sure that thereafter he will “pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.”​—Mal. 3:10; Jer. 17:7, 8.
 3. Christians who are dedicated and baptized have what serious responsibility? (Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5)

Your answer


3 Baptism, of course, is just the beginning. After you take that step, you will want to do your best to live up to your dedication vow, even in the face of temptations or tests of faith. (Read Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5.) As a disciple of Jesus, you will follow Jesus’ example and commands as closely as possible. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Pet. 2:21) This article will help you to do that.
“KEEP FOLLOWING” JESUS DESPITE TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS
 4. In what sense do Jesus’ disciples carry a “torture stake”? (Luke 9:23)

Your answer


4 After baptism, your life will not be problem free. In fact, Jesus made it clear that his disciples would carry a “torture stake.” Actually, they would do so “day after day.” (Read Luke 9:23.) Was Jesus saying that his followers would always be suffering? Not at all. He was simply emphasizing that in addition to the blessings they would experience, they would face challenges. Some of these challenges might even be painful.​—2 Tim. 3:12.
 5. What blessings did Jesus promise to those who make sacrifices?

Your answer


5 Perhaps you have already faced opposition from family members, or perhaps you have sacrificed certain material pursuits to put Kingdom interests first. (Matt. 6:33) If so, you can be certain that Jehovah has noticed your faithful works. (Heb. 6:10) Likely, you have experienced the truthfulness of Jesus’ words: “No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get 100 times more now in this period of time​—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, with persecutions—​and in the coming system of things, everlasting life.” (Mark 10:29, 30) The blessings that you have received are truly greater than any sacrifices that you have made.​—Ps. 37:4.
 6. Why will you need to continue fighting “the desire of the flesh” after baptism?

Your answer


6 You will still need to fight “the desire of the flesh” after baptism. (1 John 2:16) After all, you will still be a sinful descendant of Adam. At times, your feelings might be similar to those of the apostle Paul. He wrote: “I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my body.” (Rom. 7:22, 23) You may feel discouraged by your sinful tendencies. However, thinking about the promise you made to Jehovah when you dedicated yourself to him will strengthen your resolve to fight against temptation. The reality is that when you face temptations, your dedication vow will simplify your life. How?
 7. How will being dedicated to Jehovah help you to remain faithful to him?

Your answer


7 When you make a dedication to Jehovah, you disown yourself. This means that you say no to personal desires and ambitions that would displease Jehovah. (Matt. 16:24) So when you face a test, you will not need to spend time debating what to do. You will have already shut the door on all options except one​—faithfulness to Jehovah. You will remain firmly resolved to please Jehovah. You will in that sense be like Job. Even though he faced extremely difficult trials, he resolutely stated: “I will not renounce my integrity!”​—Job 27:5.
 8. How can reflecting on your prayer of dedication help you to resist temptation?

Your answer


8 By reflecting on your prayer of dedication to Jehovah, you will find the strength to resist any temptation. For example, would you start flirting with another person’s mate? Certainly not! You will have already said no to that. You will thus spare yourself the anguish of having to deal with improper feelings after they have taken root. You will “turn away” from “the path of the wicked.”​—Prov. 4:14, 15.
 9. How can reflecting on your prayer of dedication also help you to keep spiritual activities first?

Your answer


9 What if you are offered employment that will interfere with your regular attendance at Christian meetings? Your reaction is not in doubt. Long before the offer was made, you had already said no to such a job proposal. Thus, you will not need to figure out whether you can make a bad decision succeed. Recalling Jesus’ determination to please his Father, you will quickly and firmly reject anything that you know would displease the God to whom you are dedicated.​—Matt. 4:10; John 8:29.
10. How will Jehovah help you after baptism to “keep following” Jesus?

Your answer


10 The fact is that trials and temptations give you an opportunity to show that you are determined to “keep following” Jesus. As you do, you can be assured that Jehovah will help you. The Bible says: “God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.”​—1 Cor. 10:13.
HOW TO KEEP FOLLOWING JESUS
11. What is one of the best ways to keep following Jesus? (See also picture.)

Your answer


11 Jesus was zealous, and he remained close to Jehovah in prayer. (Luke 6:12) In fact, one of the best ways for you to keep following Jesus after your baptism is to develop a pattern of doing things that will draw you closer to Jehovah. The Bible says: “To the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same course.” (Phil. 3:16) From time to time, you will hear the experiences of brothers and sisters who have reached out to expand their sacred service. Perhaps they attended the School for Kingdom Evangelizers or moved to where there is a greater need. If you can set such a goal, by all means do so. Jehovah’s people are eager to expand their ministry. (Acts 16:9) What, though, if right now you are unable to do that? Do not think that you are inferior to those who can. The Christian race is one of endurance. (Matt. 10:22) Do not underestimate the value of serving Jehovah according to your abilities and circumstances. That is an important way that you can keep following Jesus after baptism.​—Ps. 26:1.




After your baptism, set the goal of doing things that will draw you closer to Jehovah (See paragraph 11)




12-13. What can you do if your zeal starts to diminish? (1 Corinthians 9:16, 17) (See also the box “Stay in the Race.”)

Your answer


12 What if, for a time, you feel that your prayers have become mechanical or that your ministry is in a rut? What if your Bible reading does not seem as rewarding as it did in the past? If such situations develop after your baptism, do not conclude that you have lost Jehovah’s spirit. You are an imperfect human, and your feelings can fluctuate. If your zeal starts to diminish, reflect on the example of the apostle Paul. Although he tried to imitate Jesus, he knew that at times he might not feel as motivated as at other times. (Read 1 Corinthians 9:16, 17.) He said: “Even if I do it against my will, I still have a stewardship entrusted to me.” In other words, Paul was determined to accomplish his ministry despite how he might feel at the moment.
13 Similarly, do not let your imperfect feelings make your decisions for you. Resolve that you will do the right thing despite how you feel. Your actions should in time affect your feelings for the better. At any rate, maintaining a good spiritual routine will help you to keep following Jesus after baptism. Your consistency will also be an encouragement to your fellow believers.​—1 Thess. 5:11.
Stay in the Race





An athlete has to keep in shape if he expects to remain in the game. In a similar way, you will need to keep strong spiritually if you are to remain qualified to continue serving Jehovah after baptism.


“KEEP TESTING . . . KEEP PROVING”
14. What should you regularly examine, and why? (2 Corinthians 13:5)

Your answer


14 It will also be of help to you if after baptism you examine yourself regularly. (Read 2 Corinthians 13:5.) From time to time, take a close look at your life and habits to see if you are praying daily, reading and studying the Bible, attending meetings, and participating in the ministry. Try to find ways to make these aspects of your worship even more meaningful. For example, ask yourself such questions as: ‘Can I explain basic Bible teachings to others? Are there ways that I can make my ministry more enjoyable? How specific are my prayers, and do they show that I completely rely on Jehovah? Do I regularly attend Christian meetings? How can I improve my concentration and participation at meetings?’
15-16. What do you learn from one brother’s experience about resisting temptation?

Your answer


15 You would also do well to examine yourself honestly regarding your weaknesses. A brother named Robert relates an experience that illustrates the point: “When I was about 20 years old, I had a part-time job. One day after work, a coworker invited me to her home. She said we’d be alone and we’d ‘have a good time.’ At first, I gave a few weak excuses, but I finally said no and explained why.” Robert resisted the temptation, and that is commendable. Later, though, he looked back on the incident and saw that he could have handled the situation better. He admits: “I didn’t reject the offer as firmly or as quickly as Joseph resisted Potiphar’s wife. (Gen. 39:7-9) In fact, I was surprised at how difficult it was for me to refuse. This incident helped me to see that I needed to strengthen my friendship with Jehovah.”
16 You may benefit from making a self-examination similar to what Robert made. Even when you succeed in resisting temptation, ask yourself, ‘How long did it take me to say no?’ If you see room for improvement, do not condemn yourself. Be glad that you are now aware of this weakness. Make it a matter of prayer, and take steps to strengthen your determination to live by Jehovah’s moral standards.​—Ps. 139:23, 24.
17. How was Jehovah’s name involved in Robert’s experience?

Your answer


17 There is more to Robert’s experience. He continues: “After I refused my coworker’s invitation, she said, ‘You passed the test!’ I asked her what she meant. She explained that a friend of hers, a former Witness, had told her that all young Witnesses lead a double life and that they would jump at the opportunity to compromise. So she told her friend that she would test that out with me. I realized then how glad I was that I had honored Jehovah’s name.”
18. What are you determined to do after baptism? (See also the box “A Series That You Will Enjoy.”)

Your answer


18 When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah and get baptized, you show that you want to sanctify his name no matter what comes. And you can be certain that Jehovah knows the trials you face and the temptations you resist. He will bless your efforts to remain faithful. Trust that by means of his holy spirit, he can give you the strength to do so. (Luke 11:11-13) With Jehovah’s help, you will be able to keep following Jesus after your baptism.
