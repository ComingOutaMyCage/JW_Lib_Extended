However, some feel that they can <strong><em>never do enough</em></strong> to gain his approval.

Remember that Jehovah is not rigid, or inflexible. He never demands more of us than we can reasonably do. He appreciates whatever we do for him as long as we are doing our best. Also, reflect on Bible examples of those who served Jehovah whole-souled. Think of Paul. He exerted himself zealously for years, traveling thousands of miles and establishing many congregations. Yet, when circumstances limited his share in the preaching work, did he lose God’s approval? No. He continued to do what he could, and Jehovah blessed him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:30-44:28:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 28:30, 31</a>) Similarly, what we can give to Jehovah may vary at times. But what matters to him is why we do it.

Then one evening his daughter printed on a sheet of paper the words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:15-23:30:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:15</a>: “Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>trust.” She brought it to his bedside and said, “Daddy, when you feel bad, you can remember this scripture.” Dmitrii realized that, thanks to Jehovah, his family still had adequate food, clothing, and shelter. “What I needed to do,” he says, “was stay calm and continue trusting in my God.” If you are facing a similar trial, you can trust that Jehovah cares about you and will help you to endure.</p>

She notes, “The congregation elders talked with me and reassured me of Jehovah’s love.” Later she again asked Jehovah for help. “That same day I received a letter from a group of brothers and sisters in the congregation,” she says. “As I read their comforting words, I felt that Jehovah had heard me.” Yes, Jehovah often expresses his approval through the kind words of others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:17-19:10:17" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 10:17</a>.</p>

One day, Jocelyn woke up feeling depressed. “I felt as if I had nothing to give,” she says. “But I was pioneering, and it was my service day. So I said a prayer and went out in service.” That morning Jocelyn met Mary, a kind woman who accepted a Bible study. Some months later Mary mentioned that she had been praying to God for help when Jocelyn knocked on her door. Reflecting on this experience, Jocelyn says, “I felt as if Jehovah were telling me, ‘I approve of you.’” Of course, not everyone will respond positively to our preaching <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>work. But we can be sure that Jehovah is pleased when we try our best to share the good news with others.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:5, 6</a>) But what if our heart resists the idea that Jehovah approves of us, even though we have faith in the ransom and are baptized? Remember, we cannot always trust our own feelings but we can trust Jehovah. He considers those who have faith in the ransom to be righteous in his eyes and promises to bless them. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:12-19:5:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 5:12;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:26-45:3:26" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Rom. 3:26</a>) Meditating on the ransom helped Vicky. One day, after thinking deeply about the ransom, she realized: “Jehovah had been patient with me for so long. . . . Yet, I was, in effect, saying to him: ‘Your love is not great enough to reach me. Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me.’” By meditating on this gift of the ransom, she began to feel loved by Jehovah. We too will feel loved by Jehovah and sense his approval as we reflect on the ransom.</p>
