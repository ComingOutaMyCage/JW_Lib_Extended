(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) It would be all too easy for a Christian to put material possessions, secular education, or his career ahead of opportunities to serve Jehovah. Were that to happen, it would indicate that he is being affected by the <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>world’s thinking. Of course, these things are not wrong in themselves, but they should never take first place in our life. To walk “as children of light,” we need to be “making the best use of [our] time,” focusing on what is truly important.</p>

This is what Donald, who lives in South Africa, did. He says: “I looked at my situation and supplicated Jehovah to help me be more productive in the ministry. I prayed for work that would allow me to have more time for preaching. With Jehovah’s help, I did find appropriate work. My wife and I then started our journey of full-time service together.”</p>

And that inspired counsel can help us too. As noted, it can aid us in choosing our entertainment and our associates wisely. It can motivate us to continue immersing ourselves in the light of truth by having a consistent program of Bible study. And it emphasizes the importance of holy spirit, which can produce fine qualities in us. Applying what Paul wrote can help us to make wise decisions, ones that are in harmony with Jehovah’s thinking. By doing these things, we will be able to avoid the darkness of this world and remain in the light!</p>
