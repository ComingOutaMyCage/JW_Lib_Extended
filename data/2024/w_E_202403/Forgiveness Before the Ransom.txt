BIBLE PHRASE
Forgiveness Before the Ransom




We can be forgiven of our sins only through the ransom sacrifice that Jesus paid with his blood. (Eph. 1:7) Yet, the Bible says: “God in his tolerance was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past,” that is, before Jesus provided the ransom. (Rom. 3:25, ftn.) How could Jehovah do this and at the same time maintain his perfect standard of justice?
From Jehovah’s viewpoint, the ransom was as good as paid from the moment he decided to provide an “offspring” who would save believing mankind. (Gen. 3:15; 22:18) God was absolutely certain that in his due time his only-begotten Son would willingly provide the ransom. (Gal. 4:4; Heb. 10:7-10) While on earth as God’s representative, Jesus had the authority to forgive sins before the ransom was offered. He did so by applying the value of his future sacrifice to people who had faith.​—Matt. 9:2-6.
