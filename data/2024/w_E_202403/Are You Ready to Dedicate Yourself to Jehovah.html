Many of these, like the first-century disciple Timothy, were taught the truth “from infancy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14, 15</a>) Others learned about Jehovah as adults, some late in life.

That is a commendable goal! Before getting baptized, though, you will need to dedicate yourself to Jehovah. This article will explain what dedication involves. It will also help you to see why there is no reason to hold back from taking that step, along with baptism, when you are ready to do so.</p>

The Israelites were a nation dedicated to Jehovah. But some individuals in the nation were dedicated to Jehovah in a special way. For example, Aaron wore a “holy sign of dedication”​—a shining gold plate on the front of his turban. That gold plate indicated that he was set apart to serve in a special capacity​—as Israel’s high priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:9-3:8:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 8:9</a>) The Nazirites <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>too were dedicated to Jehovah in a special way.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>) That includes saying no to “the works of the flesh,” such as sexual immorality.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Col. 1:9</a>) Your study of the Scriptures has convinced you (1) that Jehovah is real, (2) that the Bible is his inspired Word, and (3) that he uses his organization to accomplish his will.</p>

You can take to <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>heart the example of King David. You can beg Jehovah: “Search through me, O God, and know my heart. Examine me, and know my anxious thoughts. See whether there is in me any harmful way, and lead me in the way of eternity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:23-19:139:24" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 139:23, 24</a>) Jehovah blesses those who are “earnestly seeking him.” Your working toward the goal of dedication and baptism shows him you are doing just that.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[67]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Jesus said that his disciples are drawn by Jehovah. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>John 6:44</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Consider what a profound thought that is and how it applies to you. Jehovah sees something good in each person he draws to himself. He views the individual as his “special property,” or “treasured possession.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deut. 7:6</a>; ftn.) That is true in your case too.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[67]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> It may be, though, that you are a young person who is being raised in the truth. You might feel that you simply are being carried or towed along. Nevertheless, the Bible says: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jas. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 28:9</a>) When <strong><em>you</em></strong> take the initiative to draw close to Jehovah, <strong><em>he</em></strong> responds by drawing close to you. Jehovah does not view you as just being part of a group. He draws each individual​—including each individual who is being raised in the truth. When such a person takes the initiative to draw close to Jehovah, He responds, as we noted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="32-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:13-53:2:13" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.</p>
