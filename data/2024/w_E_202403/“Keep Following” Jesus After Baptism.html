At times, your feelings might be similar to those of the apostle Paul. He wrote: “I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my body.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:22-45:7:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 7:22, 23</a>) You may feel discouraged by your sinful tendencies.

Perhaps they attended the School for Kingdom Evangelizers or moved to where there is a greater need. If you can set such a goal, by all means do so. Jehovah’s people are eager to expand their ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:9-44:16:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 16:9</a>) What, though, if right now you are unable to do that?

You are an imperfect human, and your feelings can fluctuate. If your zeal starts to diminish, reflect on the example of the apostle Paul.

A brother named Robert relates an experience that illustrates the point: “When I was about 20 years old, I had a part-time job. One day after work, a coworker invited me to her home. She said we’d be alone and we’d ‘have a good time.’ At first, I gave a few weak excuses, but I finally said no and explained why.” Robert resisted the temptation, and that is commendable. Later, though, he looked back on the incident and saw that he could have handled the situation better.
