SONG 129 We Will Keep Enduring

You Can Persevere Despite Disappointments


“You have persevered for the sake of my name.”​—REV. 2:3.


FOCUS
We can persevere in Jehovah’s service despite experiencing disappointments.


 1. What are some blessings we enjoy because of being part of Jehovah’s organization?

Your answer


WE ARE truly blessed to be part of Jehovah’s organization during these turbulent last days. As world conditions deteriorate, Jehovah provides us with a united, spiritual family of brothers and sisters. (Ps. 133:1) He helps us to have strong family bonds. (Eph. 5:33–6:1) And he gives us the insight and wisdom we need to have true inner peace.
 2. What do we need to do, and why?

Your answer


2 We must, however, work hard to keep serving Jehovah faithfully. Why? Because we may at times be offended by the imperfections of others. We may also find it difficult to put up with our own shortcomings, especially if we make the same mistakes time and again. We need to persevere in Jehovah’s service (1) when a fellow believer offends us, (2) when our spouse disappoints us, and (3) when we are disappointed with ourselves. In this article, we will consider each of these situations. We will also consider what we can learn from a faithful Bible character.
PERSEVERE WHEN A FELLOW BELIEVER OFFENDS YOU
 3. What challenge do Jehovah’s people face?

Your answer


3 The challenge. Some fellow believers have personality traits that irritate us. Others may let us down or treat us in a thoughtless or unkind way. Those taking the lead can make mistakes. These realities could cause some to doubt that this is God’s organization. Rather than continue serving God “shoulder to shoulder” with their brothers and sisters, they may stop associating with those who have offended them or even stop going to meetings. (Zeph. 3:9) Is that wise? Consider what we can learn from a Bible character who experienced similar problems.
 4. What challenges did the apostle Paul face?

Your answer


4 The Bible example. The apostle Paul knew that his Christian brothers and sisters were imperfect. For example, he was misjudged soon after he started to associate with the congregation. (Acts 9:26) Later, some spoke about him behind his back to damage his reputation. (2 Cor. 10:10) Paul saw a responsible brother make a wrong decision that may have stumbled others. (Gal. 2:11, 12) And one of Paul’s close companions, Mark, greatly disappointed him. (Acts 15:37, 38) Paul could have allowed any one of these situations to cause him to refuse to associate with the offenders. Yet, he maintained a positive view of his brothers and sisters and remained active in Jehovah’s service. What helped Paul to persevere?
 5. What helped Paul not to give up on his brothers and sisters? (Colossians 3:13, 14) (See also picture.)

Your answer


5 Paul loved his brothers and sisters. Paul’s love for others helped him to focus, not on their imperfections, but on their fine qualities. Love also helped Paul to do what he himself wrote, as recorded at Colossians 3:13, 14. (Read.) Consider how this proved true regarding Mark. Although Mark abandoned Paul during his first missionary journey, Paul did not remain upset. Later, when Paul wrote a warm letter to the congregation in Colossae, he praised Mark as a valued coworker, “a source of great comfort.” (Col. 4:10, 11) While imprisoned in Rome, Paul specifically requested that Mark come to help him. (2 Tim. 4:11) Clearly, Paul did not give up on his brothers. What can we learn from Paul?




There was a difference involving Paul, Barnabas, and Mark. But later the apostle put that behind him and happily worked with Mark (See paragraph 5)




6-7. How can we persevere in showing love to our brothers and sisters despite their imperfections? (1 John 4:7)

Your answer


6 The lesson. Jehovah wants us to persevere in showing love to our brothers and sisters. (Read 1 John 4:7.) If someone fails to show some Christian quality, we can assume that he wants to follow Bible principles and that he simply acted thoughtlessly. (Prov. 12:18) God loves his faithful servants despite their shortcomings. He does not cut us off when we make mistakes; nor does he stay resentful. (Ps. 103:9) How important it is for us to imitate our forgiving Father!​—Eph. 4:32–5:1.
7 Remember, too, that as the end draws near, we need to remain close to our brothers and sisters. We can expect persecution to intensify. We may even find ourselves in prison for our faith. If that happens, we will need our brothers and sisters more than ever. (Prov. 17:17) Consider what happened to Josep,a an elder in Spain. He and other brothers were imprisoned together for their neutrality. He says: “In prison, the risk of becoming irritated with a fellow believer was high because we had no privacy. We had to put up with one another and forgive one another freely. This helped us stay united and protected. We were surrounded by inmates who did not serve Jehovah. On one occasion, I was injured and my arm was in a cast, so I was not able to do things for myself. But one of my brothers washed my clothes and cared for me in other practical ways. I experienced sincere love when I needed it most.” What good reasons we have to resolve problems with one another now!
PERSEVERE WHEN YOUR SPOUSE DISAPPOINTS YOU
 8. What challenge do married couples face?

Your answer


8 The challenge. All marriages have difficulties. The Bible frankly acknowledges that married people will have “tribulation in their flesh.” (1 Cor. 7:28) Why? Because marriage brings two imperfect people together, each with different characteristics, likes, and dislikes. Mates may come from different cultures or backgrounds. They may, in time, display traits that were not noticeable before the wedding. Any of those things can cause friction. Instead of recognizing that each has a part in the problem and therefore should work to resolve it, they may blame their mate. They may even come to see separation or divorce as the solution. But is giving up on the marriage the answer?b Let us learn from a Bible character who persevered in an extremely difficult marriage.
 9. What challenge did Abigail face?

Your answer


9 The Bible example. Abigail was married to Nabal, who the Bible says was harsh and behaved badly. (1 Sam. 25:3) It must have been difficult for Abigail to live with such a man. Could Abigail have found an easy way out of her marriage? She was given that opportunity when David, Israel’s future king, came to kill her husband for insulting him and his men. (1 Sam. 25:9-13) Abigail could have fled, allowing David to carry out his plan. Yet, she intervened and convinced David to let Nabal live. (1 Sam. 25:23-27) What could have motivated her?
10. What likely motivated Abigail to persevere in a difficult marriage?

Your answer


10 Abigail loved Jehovah and respected his standards for marriage. No doubt she was aware of what God said to Adam and Eve when He performed the first marriage. (Gen. 2:24) Abigail knew that Jehovah viewed marriage as a sacred arrangement. She wanted to please God, and that would have motivated her to do whatever she could to save her household, including her husband. She acted quickly to prevent David from murdering Nabal. She was also willing to apologize for a wrong that she did not commit. Clearly, Jehovah loved this brave, unselfish woman. What can wives and husbands learn from Abigail’s example?
11. (a) What does Jehovah expect from married people? (Ephesians 5:33) (b) What did you learn from the way Carmen worked to save her marriage? (See also picture.)

Your answers


11 The lesson. Jehovah directs that married people respect the marriage arrangement even if their mate is difficult to live with. How pleased God must be when he sees married people working hard to resolve problems and to show each other unselfish love and respect. (Read Ephesians 5:33.) Consider the example of Carmen. About six years after getting married, Carmen began studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses and later got baptized. “My husband did not take it well,” says Carmen. “He became jealous of Jehovah. He would insult me and threaten to leave me.” Even so, Carmen persevered in her marriage. For 50 years, she worked hard to have a marriage based on love and respect. “As the years went by, I learned to be more discerning and to speak tactfully to my husband. Knowing that marriage is sacred in Jehovah’s eyes, I did everything in my power to safeguard it. I never gave up on my marriage because I love Jehovah.”c If difficulties arise in your marriage, you can trust that Jehovah will support you and help you to persevere.




Can you see a lesson in Abigail’s willingness to do what she could to save her household? (See paragraph 11)




PERSEVERE WHEN YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH YOURSELF
12. What challenge may we face if we commit a serious sin?

Your answer


12 The challenge. We may feel like giving up on ourselves if we commit a serious sin. The Bible acknowledges that our sins can leave us feeling “broken and crushed.” (Ps. 51:17) One brother named Robert had worked hard for years to qualify as a ministerial servant. However, he committed a serious sin that made him realize that he had betrayed Jehovah. “My conscience came down on me like a ton of bricks,” he says. “Afterward, I felt sick to my stomach. I sobbed and prayed to Jehovah. I remember thinking that God would never again bother to listen to me. Why would he? I had let him down.” If we succumb to sin, we may feel like giving up on ourselves because our crushed heart believes that Jehovah has given up on us. (Ps. 38:4) If you have felt this way, consider a faithful Bible character who persevered in serving Jehovah despite committing a serious sin.
13. What grave sin did the apostle Peter commit, and what led up to it?

Your answer


13 The Bible example. The night before Jesus’ execution, the apostle Peter made a series of mistakes that led to the worst failure of his life. First, Peter displayed overconfidence, boasting that he would prove faithful even if the other apostles abandoned Jesus. (Mark 14:27-29) Next, while in the garden of Gethsemane, Peter repeatedly failed to keep on the watch. (Mark 14:32, 37-41) Then, Peter abandoned Jesus to a mob. (Mark 14:50) Finally, Peter denied knowing Jesus three times, even swearing to this lie with an oath. (Mark 14:66-71) How did Peter react when he realized the gravity of his sin? He broke down and wept bitterly, perhaps feeling devastated by guilt. (Mark 14:72) Just imagine Peter’s anguish when hours later his friend Jesus was executed. How unworthy Peter must have felt!
14. What helped Peter to persevere in serving Jehovah? (See picture.)

Your answer


14 Peter was able to persevere in serving Jehovah for several reasons. He did not isolate himself; he went to his spiritual brothers and no doubt was comforted by them. (Luke 24:33) In addition, the resurrected Jesus appeared to Peter, likely to encourage him. (Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5) Later, instead of rebuking Peter for his failings, Jesus told his friend that he would receive greater responsibilities. (John 21:15-17) Peter knew that he had sinned gravely, but he did not give up on himself. Why? Because he was convinced that his Master, Jesus, had not given up on him. And Peter’s spiritual brothers continued to support him. What can we learn from Peter’s example?




John 21:15-17 shows that Jesus did not give up on Peter, which encouraged Peter to persevere (See paragraph 14)




15. Of what does Jehovah want us to be convinced? (Psalm 86:5; Romans 8:38, 39) (See also picture.)

Your answer


15 The lesson. Jehovah wants us to be convinced of his love and forgiveness. (Read Psalm 86:5; Romans 8:38, 39.) When we sin, we feel guilty. That is normal and appropriate. However, we must not think that we are unlovable or unforgivable. Instead we should immediately get help. Robert, mentioned earlier, says: “I fell into sin because I relied on my own strength to resist a temptation.” He realized that he had to talk to the elders. He says: “Once I took that step, I immediately felt Jehovah’s loving hand expressed through them. The elders did not give up on me. They helped me to believe that Jehovah had not abandoned me.” We too can be convinced that Jehovah loves us deeply and forgives us if we repent of our sins, seek needed help, and earnestly try not to repeat our mistakes. (1 John 1:8, 9) That conviction prevents us from giving up on ourselves when we stumble or fall.




How do you or will you feel when hardworking elders provide help? (See paragraph 15)




16. Why are you determined to persevere in Jehovah’s service?

Your answer


16 Jehovah greatly appreciates our efforts to serve him during these difficult last days. With Jehovah’s help, we can persevere despite disappointments. We can cultivate love for our brothers and sisters and forgive them even if they offend us. We can show the depth of our love for God and our respect for his arrangements by doing whatever we can to resolve problems that may arise in our marriage. And if we commit a sin, we can seek Jehovah’s help, accept his love and forgiveness, and keep moving forward in his service. We can be sure that we will reap rich blessings if we do “not give up in doing what is fine.”​—Gal. 6:9.

a Some names have been changed.
b God’s Word discourages separation and makes clear that separation does not give either mate the right to remarry. However, there are serious situations in which some Christians have considered separation. See endnote 4 “Marital Separation” in the Enjoy Life Forever! book.
c For another example, see on jw.org the video Do Not Be Misled by Imitation Peace!​—Darrel and Deborah Freisinger.
