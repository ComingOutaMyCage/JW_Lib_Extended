Because we may at times be offended by the imperfections of others. We may also find it difficult to put up with our own shortcomings, especially if we make the same mistakes time and again. We need to persevere in Jehovah’s service (1) when a fellow believer offends us, (2) when our spouse disappoints us, and (3) when we are disappointed with ourselves. In this article, we will consider each of these situations. We will also consider what we can learn from a faithful Bible character.</p>

We had to put up with one another and forgive one another freely. This helped us stay united and protected. We were surrounded by inmates who did not serve Jehovah. On one occasion, I was injured and my arm was in a cast, so I was not able to do things for myself. But one of my brothers washed my clothes and cared for me in other practical ways.

Because marriage brings two imperfect people together, each with different characteristics, likes, and dislikes. Mates may come from different cultures or backgrounds. They may, in time, display traits that were not noticeable before the wedding. Any of those things can cause friction.

That is normal and appropriate. However, we must not think that we are unlovable or unforgivable. Instead we should immediately get help. Robert, mentioned earlier, says: “I fell into sin because I relied on my own strength to resist a temptation.” He realized that he had to talk to the elders. He says: “Once I took that step, I immediately felt Jehovah’s loving hand expressed through them. The elders did not give up on me. They helped me to believe that Jehovah had not abandoned me.” We too can be convinced that Jehovah loves us deeply and forgives us if we repent of our sins, seek needed help, and earnestly try not to repeat our mistakes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:9" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 John 1:8, 9</a>) That conviction prevents us from giving up on ourselves when we stumble or fall.</p>

With Jehovah’s help, we <strong><em>can</em></strong> persevere despite disappointments. We can cultivate love for our brothers and sisters and forgive them even if they offend us. We can show the depth of our love for God and our respect for his arrangements by doing whatever we can to resolve problems that may arise in our marriage. And if we commit a sin, we can seek Jehovah’s help, accept his love and forgiveness, and keep moving forward in his service. We can be sure that we will reap rich blessings if we do “not give up in doing what is fine.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:9-48:6:9" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Gal. 6:9</a>.</p>
