SONG 107 The Divine Pattern of Love

Responding to Sin With Love and Mercy


“God in his kindness is trying to lead you to repentance.”​—ROM. 2:4.


FOCUS
How the elders try to help those in the congregation who get involved in serious sin.


 1. What is true of some who commit a serious sin?

Your answer


IN THE preceding article, we saw how the apostle Paul handled a case of serious wrongdoing in Corinth. The sinner was unrepentant and had to be removed from the congregation. However, as our theme text shows, some who have committed a serious sin can be reached. They can be led to repentance. (Rom. 2:4) How can the elders help them to repent?
2-3. What should we do if we come to know that a fellow believer has committed a serious sin, and why?

Your answer


2 Before the elders can help, they need to be aware of the matter. So, what should we do if we come to know that a fellow believer has committed a serious sin​—something that could result in his being removed from the congregation? We should encourage the wrongdoer to go to the elders for help.​—Isa. 1:18; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2.
3 What, though, if the wrongdoer refuses to speak to the elders? Then we would go to the elders ourselves to make sure that the person will get the necessary help. That is the loving thing to do because we do not want to lose our brother or sister. If the wrongdoer continues in his course, he will further impair his relationship with Jehovah. He may also damage the reputation of the congregation. So we courageously take action out of love for Jehovah and for the wrongdoer.​—Ps. 27:14.
HOW THE ELDERS ASSIST THOSE WHO GET INVOLVED IN SERIOUS SIN
 4. What is the elders’ goal when they meet with someone who has committed a serious sin?

Your answer


4 When someone in the congregation commits a serious sin, the body of elders selects three qualified brothers from among them who will serve as a committee.a These men need to be modest and humble. While they will try to help the erring one to repent, they recognize that they cannot force someone to change. (Deut. 30:19) The elders acknowledge that not all wrongdoers will respond in a positive way, as did King David. (2 Sam. 12:13) Some wrongdoers may choose to ignore Jehovah’s admonition. (Gen. 4:6-8) Nevertheless, the elders’ goal is to lead the wrongdoer to repentance if at all possible. What principles guide them as they meet with the wrongdoer?
 5. What counsel will the elders have in mind when they meet with the wrongdoer? (2 Timothy 2:24-26) (See also picture.)

Your answer


5 The elders view the wrongdoer as a precious, lost sheep. (Luke 15:4, 6) Therefore, when they meet with the individual, they are not harsh in their speech, attitude, and approach; nor do they view the meeting as a mere routine in which they follow a set procedure. Instead, they will display the qualities found at 2 Timothy 2:24-26. (Read.) The elders remain mild, gentle, and kind as they strive to reach the wrongdoer’s heart.




Just like ancient shepherds, the elders endeavor to recover a lost sheep (See paragraph 5)




 6. How will the elders prepare their own heart before meeting with a wrongdoer? (Romans 2:4)

Your answer


6 The elders prepare their own heart. They try to imitate Jehovah in all their dealings with a sinner, remembering Paul’s words: “God in his kindness is trying to lead you to repentance.” (Read Romans 2:4.) The elders must remember that they are primarily shepherds under the direction of Christ. (Isa. 11:3, 4; Matt. 18:18-20) Before meeting with the wrongdoer, the committee will prayerfully consider their goal: to lead the wrongdoer to repentance. They will do research in the Scriptures and in our publications and will pray for discernment. They will consider what they need to know about the individual’s background that may have contributed to his thinking, attitude, and conduct.​—Prov. 20:5.
7-8. How can the elders imitate Jehovah’s patience when they meet with a wrongdoer?

Your answer


7 The elders imitate Jehovah’s patience. They keep in mind how Jehovah dealt with wrongdoers in the past. For example, Jehovah reasoned patiently with Cain, warning him about the consequences of sin and offering him hope of restoration. (Gen. 4:6, 7) Jehovah admonished David by means of the prophet Nathan, who used an illustration that touched the heart of the king. (2 Sam. 12:1-7) And Jehovah “kept sending” his prophets “again and again” to the wayward nation of Israel. (Jer. 7:24, 25) He did not wait for his people to repent before helping them. Rather, he took the initiative by urging them to repent.
8 Elders follow Jehovah’s example when trying to help those who have got involved in serious sin. As 2 Timothy 4:2 directs, they reason “with all patience” when dealing with a troubled fellow believer. A study note on that verse says of such an elder: “He would always need to show restraint, patiently appealing to [the sinner’s] desire to do what [is] right. If [the elder] were to give in to annoyance or frustration, he might alienate or even stumble [the sinner].”
9-10. How can elders help the sinner reason on his course?

Your answer


9 The elders try to determine the circumstances that led up to the sin. For example, did the Christian slowly become weak because he neglected personal study or the ministry? Have his prayers to Jehovah become infrequent or superficial? Has he been allowing wrong desires to guide him? Has he made unwise choices in his associations or entertainment? How might such choices have affected his heart? Does he recognize how his recent decisions and actions have affected his Father, Jehovah?
10 By asking meaningful questions without being unnecessarily intrusive, the elders kindly draw out the wrongdoer and help him to reason on his course. (Prov. 20:5) In addition, they might use illustrations to help the person to reason and to see the wrongness of his actions, as Nathan did with David. Perhaps during the first meeting, the person will begin to feel real sorrow over the course he has followed. He may even repent.
11. How did Jesus deal with sinners?

Your answer


11 The elders strive to imitate Jesus. When dealing with Saul of Tarsus, the resurrected Jesus asked a probing question: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” Jesus thereby helped him to reason on his wrong course. (Acts 9:3-6) And in the case of “that woman Jezebel,” Jesus said: “I gave her time to repent.”​—Rev. 2:20, 21.
12-13. How might the elders give a wrongdoer time to repent? (See also picture.)

Your answer


12 In imitation of Jesus, the elders are not hasty to conclude that a wrongdoer will not repent. While some may repent during the committee’s first meeting with them, others may need more time. So the elders may arrange to meet with the sinner more than once. Perhaps after that first meeting, the erring Christian will begin to think seriously about what he has been told. He may approach Jehovah in humble prayer. (Ps. 32:5; 38:18) Thus, at a subsequent meeting, the sinner may have a different spirit from the one he showed at the first meeting.
13 To help lead the sinner to repentance, the elders show empathy and kindness. They hope and pray that Jehovah will bless their efforts and that the wayward Christian may come to his senses and repent.​—2 Tim. 2:25, 26.




The elders may meet with a wrongdoer more than once in order to give him time to repent (See paragraph 12)




14. Who deserves the credit when a sinner repents, and why?

Your answer


14 If the sinner repents, that is a cause for great joy! (Luke 15:7, 10) Who deserves the credit? Do the elders? Recall what Paul wrote about sinners: “Perhaps God may give them repentance.” (2 Tim. 2:25) A study note on that verse comments: “The credit for such a change in thinking and attitude goes, not to any human, but to Jehovah, who helps the wayward Christian make this vital change. Paul goes on to mention some of the beautiful results of such repentance​—it leads the sinner to a more accurate knowledge of the truth, it helps him come back to his proper senses, and it enables him to escape from Satan’s snares.​—2Ti 2:26.”
15. How may the elders continue to help a repentant wrongdoer?

Your answer


15 When a wrongdoer repents, the committee will arrange for shepherding visits so that the person can continue to receive the help he needs to fight against Satan’s snares and to make straight paths for his feet. (Heb. 12:12, 13) Of course, the elders do not reveal to anyone the details of the sinner’s course. About what, though, might the congregation need to be informed?
“REPROVE BEFORE ALL ONLOOKERS”
16. According to 1 Timothy 5:20, what “onlookers” does Paul refer to?

Your answer


16 Read 1 Timothy 5:20. Paul wrote those words to his fellow elder Timothy in connection with how to handle “those who practice sin.” What did he mean? He did not necessarily mean that the whole congregation were the “onlookers.” Rather, he was referring to those few who might already know of the sins. They could be eyewitnesses, or they could be those whom the wrongdoer confided in. The elders would discreetly make them aware that the matter was handled and that the sinner was corrected.
17. If a serious sin is widely known in the congregation or is likely to become known, what announcement would be made, and why?

Your answer


17 In some instances, the wrongdoing may have become widely known in the congregation or is likely to become known. In such a case, the “onlookers” would include the entire congregation. So an elder would announce to the congregation that the brother or the sister has been reproved. Why? Paul answers: “As a warning to the rest” not to fall into sin.
18. How will the elders handle situations involving baptized minors? (See also picture.)

Your answer


18 What about baptized minors​—those under 18 years of age—​who engage in serious wrongdoing? The body of elders will arrange for two elders to meet with the minor and his Christian parents.b The elders will find out what steps the parents have already taken to help their child come to repentance. If the minor has a good attitude and the parents are reaching him, the two elders might decide that it is not necessary to take the matter any further. After all, it is the parents’ God-given responsibility to provide loving correction to their children. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Prov. 6:20; 22:6; Eph. 6:2-4) The elders will thereafter occasionally check with the parents to make sure that the minor is getting the help he needs. However, what if a baptized minor unrepentantly persists in a wrong course? In that case, a committee of elders will meet with him along with his Christian parents.




When a minor gets involved in serious sin, two elders will meet with the minor and his Christian parents (See paragraph 18)




“JEHOVAH IS VERY TENDER IN AFFECTION AND MERCIFUL”
19. How do elders strive to imitate Jehovah when dealing with wrongdoers?

Your answer


19 Elders who serve on committees have a responsibility before Jehovah to keep the congregation clean. (1 Cor. 5:7) They also want wrongdoers to be moved to repentance if possible. To that end, elders maintain a positive, hopeful outlook. Why? Because they want to imitate Jehovah, who is “very tender in affection and merciful.” (Jas. 5:11) Note how the aged apostle John showed such a spirit. He wrote: “My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.”​—1 John 2:1.
20. What will we consider in the final article of this series?

Your answer


20 Sadly, there are times when a Christian refuses to repent. If so, he must be removed from the congregation. How do the elders handle such serious cases? We will consider that matter in the final article of this series.

SONG 103 Shepherds​—Gifts in Men

a In the past, these groups were called judicial committees. But since judging is only one aspect of their work, we will no longer use that expression. Instead, we will simply refer to this group as a committee of elders.
b What is said about parents also applies to legal guardians or others who have parental responsibility for a minor.
