A brother in that congregation was having sexual relations with his stepmother. Such behavior was shocking and was “not even found among the nations”! The congregation not only tolerated his behavior but also may have been rather proud of it. Perhaps some thought that it demonstrated how merciful and understanding God is toward imperfect humans. But Jehovah does not condone wrongdoing among his people. With such a brazen course, the man was surely damaging the good reputation of the congregation. He could also have been influencing other Christians who were associating with him. So, what did Paul direct the congregation to do?</p>

Paul explained that this command included “not even eating with such a man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:11</a>) Sitting down to a meal with someone can easily lead to having further association with him.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[56]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> How, then, could the congregation in Corinth imitate Jehovah, not Satan? By following Jehovah’s way of dealing with repentant sinners. Note what some Bible writers said about Jehovah. He is “good and ready to forgive,” said David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>) Micah wrote: “Who is a God like you, pardoning error and passing over the transgression?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:18-33:7:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Mic. 7:18</a>) And Isaiah stated: “Let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man his <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>thoughts; let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy on him, to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 55:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[58]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> To imitate Jehovah, the congregation in Corinth had to welcome the repentant man back and assure him of their love. By following Paul’s direction to welcome back the repentant sinner, the congregation showed their “obedience in all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:9-47:2:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:9</a>) True, only months had passed since he was removed, but the discipline had successfully led him to repentance. So there would be no point in delaying his reinstatement into the congregation.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p68" data-pid="68">It appears that the man discussed in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:13" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 5</a> was reinstated in a relatively short time after he was removed. What factors have led to this conclusion?</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69">Consider when Paul’s two letters to the Corinthians were written. He evidently wrote the first one during his third missionary tour, probably in early 55 C.E. It seems likely that he wrote the second letter later that same year, perhaps in late summer or early autumn of 55 C.E.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70">Consider also that in Paul’s first letter, he had given instructions on contributing to a relief effort for Judean Christians who were suffering from famine. Because lives were at stake, Paul surely followed up quickly with his second letter, in which he asked the congregation to prepare their donations for delivery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:1-46:16:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Cor. 16:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:5-47:9:5" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71">Paul had another good reason to write his second letter as soon as possible. He had received reports about the man’s repentance. In those days, it would have taken some time for a letter to be delivered. So Paul likely wrote again soon in order to direct the congregation on what to do next.</p>

</div>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72">With such factors in mind, it seems reasonable to conclude that Paul urged the congregation to reinstate the repentant wrongdoer just a short time​—perhaps only months—​after he had been removed from the congregation.</p>
