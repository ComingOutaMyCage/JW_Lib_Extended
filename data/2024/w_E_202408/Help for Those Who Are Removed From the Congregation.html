By no means! When informing an unrepentant wrongdoer that he will be removed from the congregation, the committee of elders will explain to him what steps he can take to return to the congregation. But the elders will do even more. In most cases, they will tell the wrongdoer that they would like to meet with him again after a few months have passed to see if he has had a change of heart. If the wrongdoer is willing to meet with them <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>again, the elders will at that subsequent meeting make a warm appeal for him to repent and return.

For example, Jehovah did not wait for his wayward people in ancient Israel to take the first step. Rather, he took the initiative to reach out to them even before they showed any signs of repentance. As noted in the second article in this series, Jehovah illustrated his compassion by telling the prophet Hosea to offer reconciliation to his wife, who was still sinning.

During such visits, the elders will even offer to pray with them and make a warm appeal for them to return to the congregation. Of course, if a person has been away from the congregation for many years, he would no doubt be very weak spiritually. Therefore, if he indicates that he wants to return to the congregation, the elders might arrange for someone to conduct a Bible study with him, even though he has not yet been reinstated. <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>In all cases, the elders would be the ones to arrange for the Bible study.</p>

<p id="p73" data-pid="73">Consider the differences between the circumstances addressed by each apostle. Paul wrote with regard to a man who was committing sexual immorality. About 43 years later, John wrote with regard to apostates and others who actively promote false teachings and wrong conduct. For example, some were teaching that Jesus was not the Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:22-62:2:22" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 John 2:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:2-62:4:3" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 4:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74">When John wrote his letters, apostasy was widespread. Although he knew that he could not prevent it, he fulfilled his responsibility as an apostle to act “as a restraint” against apostasy by holding it back as long as possible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:7-53:2:7" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75">Thus, John warned fellow believers to avoid being fooled by these deceivers and false teachers. He directed Christians never to accept such ones into their homes or even to greet them. Greeting someone who promotes falsehood would give him an opening for presenting his twisted, corrupt teachings. Something similar could happen if a person commented on apostate computer blogs or social media. Anyone who would welcome an apostate with a greeting would become “a sharer in his wicked works.”</p>
<p id="p76" data-pid="76">By contrast, Paul wrote with regard to a man who had to be removed from the congregation for sexual immorality, as indicated in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:13" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 5</a>. But that man was apparently not an apostate; nor was he actively teaching others to violate God’s standards. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:20-66:2:20" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 2:20</a>.) So while Paul directed those in the congregation to stop keeping company with him​—not even eating with him—​he did not state that they must never say a simple greeting.</p>
