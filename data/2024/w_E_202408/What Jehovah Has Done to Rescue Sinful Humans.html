He gave them a beautiful home, the gift of marriage, and a fascinating assignment. They were to fill the earth with their descendants, making the whole planet a paradise like the garden of Eden. He gave them only one simple restriction. And he warned them that if they broke that command by deliberately rebelling against him, their sin would lead to death. We know what happened. An invisible spirit, one who had no love for God or for them, entered the picture and tempted them to commit that sin. Adam and Eve gave in to that bad influence. Failing to trust their loving Father, they sinned. As we know, Jehovah’s words proved true. From that day onward, they had to face the consequences: they began to grow old, and finally they died.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:8-1:2:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:18" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 3:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 17-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:5-1:5:5" data-bid="4-7" class="b"> 5:5</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:2-23:59:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 59:2</a>) That is why Satan, the rebel spirit who instigated all this trouble, loves sin and seeks to promote it. He might have thought that he won a great victory in Eden. But he did not understand how loving Jehovah is. God never changed his purpose for the descendants of Adam and Eve. He loves the human family, so he immediately offered hope to all. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:20-45:8:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 8:20, 21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jehovah knew that some of those descendants would choose to love him and would seek his help in fighting against sin.

Abel <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>was a shepherd, so he took some of his young lambs and slaughtered them, offering them up to Jehovah.

But to receive God’s forgiveness, we must do something. What is that? John the Baptist and then Jesus Christ himself provided the answer: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:1-40:3:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 3:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 4:17</a>) So repentance is key if we truly want to fight against sin and draw close to our loving Father. But what is involved in being repentant, and how does it help us combat our sinful condition? The next study article will provide the answer.</p>

But the word “sin” may also refer to the imperfect, or sinful, condition that we have inherited from Adam. Inherited sin is the reason why we all die.</p></div>
