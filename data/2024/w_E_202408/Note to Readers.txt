Note to Readers




Dear Reader
In this issue of The Watchtower, we will feature five study articles that consider the following closely related questions:
  First, what arrangement did Jehovah put in place to help his human sons and daughters to combat sin?

  Second, how has he taught us what genuine repentance is and how has he helped sinners to repent?

  Third, how was the congregation in Corinth instructed to handle a willful, unrepentant sinner?

  Fourth, how should Christian elders today handle cases of serious sin?

  Fifth, after an unrepentant sinner has been removed from the congregation, how can the congregation continue to treat him in a loving and merciful way?
