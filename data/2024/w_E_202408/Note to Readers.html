<p id="p3" data-pid="3">In this issue of <em>The Watchtower,</em> we will feature five study articles that consider the following closely related questions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4">  First, what arrangement did Jehovah put in place to help his human sons and daughters to combat sin?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5">  Second, how has he taught us what genuine repentance is and how has he helped sinners to repent?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6">  Third, how was the congregation in Corinth instructed to handle a willful, unrepentant sinner?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7">  Fourth, how should Christian elders today handle cases of serious sin?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8">  Fifth, after an unrepentant sinner has been removed from the congregation, how can the congregation continue to treat him in a loving and merciful way?</p>
</li>
</ul>
