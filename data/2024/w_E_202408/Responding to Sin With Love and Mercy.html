So, what should we do if we come to know that a fellow believer has committed a serious sin​—something that could result in his being removed from the congregation? We should encourage the wrongdoer to go to the elders for help.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:2</a>.</p>

Then we would go to the elders ourselves to make sure that the person will get the necessary help. That is the loving thing to do because we do not want to lose our brother or sister. If the wrongdoer continues in his course, he will further impair his relationship with Jehovah. He may also damage the reputation of the congregation. So we courageously take action out of love for Jehovah and for the wrongdoer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:14-19:27:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 27:14</a>.</p>

For example, Jehovah reasoned patiently with Cain, warning him about the consequences of sin and offering him hope of restoration. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:6-1:4:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 4:6, 7</a>) Jehovah admonished David by means of the prophet Nathan, who used an illustration that touched the heart of the king.

A study note on that verse says of such an elder: “He would always need to show restraint, patiently appealing to [the sinner’s] desire to do what [is] right. If [the elder] were to give in to annoyance or frustration, he might alienate or even stumble [the sinner].”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:7</a>) They also want wrongdoers to be moved to repentance if possible. To that end, elders maintain a positive, hopeful outlook. Why? Because they want to imitate Jehovah, who is “very tender in affection and merciful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>) Note how the aged apostle John showed such a spirit. He wrote: “My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 John 2:1</a>.</p>
