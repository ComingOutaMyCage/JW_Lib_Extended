Help for Those Who Are Removed From the Congregation


“There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance.”​—LUKE 15:7.


FOCUS
Why some individuals need to be removed from the congregation and how elders can help such ones to repent and be restored to Jehovah’s favor.


1-2. (a) How does Jehovah view willful sin? (b) What is Jehovah’s hope toward wrongdoers?

Your answers


JEHOVAH is not a permissive God; he does not condone sin. (Ps. 5:4-6) He requires that we respect his righteous standards, which he has set forth for us in his Word. Of course, Jehovah does not expect perfection from imperfect people. (Ps. 130:3, 4) At the same time, he does not tolerate ‘ungodly men who turn his undeserved kindness into an excuse for brazen conduct.’ (Jude 4) Indeed, the Bible speaks of the “destruction of the ungodly” at God’s war of Armageddon.​—2 Pet. 3:7; Rev. 16:16.
2 However, Jehovah does not want anyone to suffer destruction. As we discussed earlier in this series of articles, the Bible clearly states that he “desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Christian elders imitate Jehovah as they patiently try to help wrongdoers to change their ways and be restored to Jehovah’s favor. However, not all wrongdoers respond favorably. (Isa. 6:9) Some continue in a wrong course despite the elders’ repeated efforts to lead them to repentance. What is to be done in such a situation?
“REMOVE THE WICKED PERSON”
 3. (a) What does the Bible say should be done with unrepentant sinners? (b) Why can we say that, in a sense, the wrongdoer has chosen to be removed from the congregation?

Your answers


3 When a wrongdoer is unrepentant, the elders have no choice but to follow the direction found at 1 Corinthians 5:13: “Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.” In a sense, the wrongdoer has chosen that consequence; he is reaping what hea has sown. (Gal. 6:7) Why can we say that? Because he has refused to respond to repeated attempts by the elders to lead him to repentance. (2 Ki. 17:12-15) His actions show that he has chosen not to abide by Jehovah’s standards.​—Deut. 30:19, 20.
 4. Why is an announcement made when an unrepentant wrongdoer is removed from the congregation?

Your answer


4 When an unrepentant wrongdoer is removed from the congregation, an announcement is made to inform the congregation that he is no longer one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.b The purpose of that announcement is not to humiliate the wrongdoer. Rather, it is made so that the congregation can follow the Scriptural admonition to “stop keeping company” with that person, “not even eating with” him. (1 Cor. 5:9-11) That direction is given for good reason. The apostle Paul wrote: “A little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough.” (1 Cor. 5:6) Unrepentant wrongdoers can weaken the determination of those who are trying to live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.​—Prov. 13:20; 1 Cor. 15:33.
 5. How should we view a person who has been removed from the congregation, and why?

Your answer


5 How, then, should we view a fellow believer who is removed from the congregation? Although we do not socialize with him, we should view him as a lost sheep, not a lost cause. A sheep that has strayed from the fold may well return. Remember, that lost sheep dedicated himself to Jehovah. Sadly, he is not living up to that dedication at present, and that puts him in a dangerous position. (Ezek. 18:31) Nevertheless, as long as Jehovah’s mercy is available, there is hope that the person will return. How do the elders reflect that hope even toward a wrongdoer who has been removed from the congregation?
HOW THE ELDERS ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE REMOVED
 6. What steps will the elders take to assist one who has been removed from the congregation?

Your answer


6 Is the individual who has been removed from the congregation abandoned​—left completely on his own to find his way back to Jehovah? By no means! When informing an unrepentant wrongdoer that he will be removed from the congregation, the committee of elders will explain to him what steps he can take to return to the congregation. But the elders will do even more. In most cases, they will tell the wrongdoer that they would like to meet with him again after a few months have passed to see if he has had a change of heart. If the wrongdoer is willing to meet with them again, the elders will at that subsequent meeting make a warm appeal for him to repent and return. Even if he has not had a change of heart at that time, the elders will make periodic efforts to contact him in the future.
 7. How do the elders reflect Jehovah’s compassion when dealing with a person who has been removed from the congregation? (Jeremiah 3:12)

Your answer


7 The elders strive to reflect Jehovah’s compassion as they deal with someone who has been removed from the congregation. For example, Jehovah did not wait for his wayward people in ancient Israel to take the first step. Rather, he took the initiative to reach out to them even before they showed any signs of repentance. As noted in the second article in this series, Jehovah illustrated his compassion by telling the prophet Hosea to offer reconciliation to his wife, who was still sinning. (Hos. 3:1; Mal. 3:7) In imitation of Jehovah, Christian elders genuinely want the wrongdoer to return, and they do not make it difficult for him to do so.​—Read Jeremiah 3:12.
 8. How does Jesus’ parable of the lost son offer further insight into Jehovah’s compassion and mercy? (Luke 15:7)

Your answer


8 Recall Jesus’ parable of the lost son, as discussed in the second article in this series. When catching sight of his son returning home, the father “ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him.” (Luke 15:20) Notice that the father did not wait for his son to beg for forgiveness. Rather, he took the initiative, as any loving father would. The elders strive to show a similar attitude toward those who have strayed. They want these lost sheep to “come back home.” (Luke 15:22-24, 32) There is joy in heaven when a sinner returns, and there is joy on earth as well!​—Read Luke 15:7.
 9. How does Jehovah warmly appeal to sinners?

Your answer


9 From what we have considered so far, it is clear that Jehovah does not condone unrepentant wrongdoing. However, he does not turn his back on wrongdoers. He wants them to return. Jehovah’s feelings toward repentant wrongdoers are expressed at Hosea 14:4: “I will heal their unfaithfulness. I will love them of my own free will, because my anger has turned away.” What a strong incentive for elders to respond to any signs of repentance. And what a strong incentive for those who have left Jehovah to return without delay.
10-11. How will the elders try to help those who in the past were removed from the congregation?

Your answer


10 What about individuals who in the past were removed from the congregation, perhaps many years ago? Such individuals may no longer be practicing the sin for which they were removed. In some situations, they may not even recall why they were removed. Whatever the case, the elders will try to locate and visit these individuals. During such visits, the elders will even offer to pray with them and make a warm appeal for them to return to the congregation. Of course, if a person has been away from the congregation for many years, he would no doubt be very weak spiritually. Therefore, if he indicates that he wants to return to the congregation, the elders might arrange for someone to conduct a Bible study with him, even though he has not yet been reinstated. In all cases, the elders would be the ones to arrange for the Bible study.
11 In imitation of Jehovah’s compassion, the elders want to reach out and help as many as possible to know that the door is open for them to come back. When a sinner manifests repentance and abandons his wrong course, he can be reinstated without delay.​—2 Cor. 2:6-8.
12. (a) What situations require elders to be especially careful? (b) Why should we not feel that it is impossible for certain types of sinners to receive Jehovah’s mercy? (See also footnote.)

Your answers


12 In certain circumstances the elders need to be especially careful before reinstating someone. For example, if a person was guilty of child abuse or apostasy or if he schemed to end a marriage, the elders would want to be sure that he is truly repentant. (Mal. 2:14; 2 Tim. 3:6) They must protect the flock. At the same time, we need to realize that Jehovah will accept back any wrongdoer who shows genuine repentance and stops engaging in wrong conduct. So although the elders exercise due caution with those who have dealt treacherously with others, they should not go so far as to say that certain types of sinners can never receive Jehovah’s mercy.c​—1 Pet. 2:10.
WHAT THE CONGREGATION CAN DO
13. What is the difference between the way we treat someone who has been reproved by the elders and the way we treat someone who has been removed from the congregation?

Your answer


13 As discussed in the preceding article, sometimes an announcement is made that a person has been reproved. In such a case, we can continue to associate with him, knowing that he repented and abandoned his wrong course. (1 Tim. 5:20) He is still a part of the congregation and needs the encouragement that comes from associating with fellow believers. (Heb. 10:24, 25) However, the situation is quite different with a person who has been removed from the congregation. We “stop keeping company” with that person, “not even eating with such a man.”​—1 Cor. 5:11.
14. How can Christians use their Bible-trained conscience in dealing with those who have been removed from the congregation? (See also picture.)

Your answer


14 Does what we have considered mean that we would completely ignore a person who has been removed from the congregation? Not necessarily. Certainly, we would not socialize with him. But Christians can use their Bible-trained conscience in deciding whether to invite a person who was removed from the congregation​—perhaps a relative or someone they were close to previously—​to attend a congregation meeting. What if he attends? In the past, we would not greet such a person. Here again, each Christian needs to use his Bible-trained conscience in this matter. Some may feel comfortable with greeting or welcoming the person to the meeting. However, we would not have an extended conversation or socialize with the individual.




Christians can use their Bible-trained conscience when deciding whether to invite a person who has been removed from the congregation to a meeting or to welcome the individual to the meeting with a simple greeting (See paragraph 14)




15. What type of sinners are described at 2 John 9-11? (See also the box “Were John and Paul Discussing the Same Kind of Sin?”)

Your answer


15 Some may wonder, ‘Doesn’t the Bible say that a Christian who says a greeting to such a person becomes a sharer in his wicked works?’ (Read 2 John 9-11.) The context of this scripture shows that this direction refers to apostates and others who actively promote wrong conduct. (Rev. 2:20) Therefore, if a person is actively promoting apostate teachings or other wrongdoing, the elders would not arrange to visit him. Of course, there is hope that he will come to his senses. Until that happens, though, we would neither greet such a person nor invite him to attend a congregation meeting.
Were John and Paul Discussing the Same Kind of Sin?
In his second inspired letter, the apostle John wrote: “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.”​—2 John 10, 11.
In stating that Christians should not even “say a greeting,” was John adding to the apostle Paul’s direction found at 1 Corinthians 5:11 “to stop keeping company” with people who had been removed from the congregation? Were John and Paul discussing the same kind of sin? Evidently not.
Consider the differences between the circumstances addressed by each apostle. Paul wrote with regard to a man who was committing sexual immorality. About 43 years later, John wrote with regard to apostates and others who actively promote false teachings and wrong conduct. For example, some were teaching that Jesus was not the Christ.​—1 John 2:22; 4:2, 3.
When John wrote his letters, apostasy was widespread. Although he knew that he could not prevent it, he fulfilled his responsibility as an apostle to act “as a restraint” against apostasy by holding it back as long as possible.​—2 Thess. 2:7.
Thus, John warned fellow believers to avoid being fooled by these deceivers and false teachers. He directed Christians never to accept such ones into their homes or even to greet them. Greeting someone who promotes falsehood would give him an opening for presenting his twisted, corrupt teachings. Something similar could happen if a person commented on apostate computer blogs or social media. Anyone who would welcome an apostate with a greeting would become “a sharer in his wicked works.”
By contrast, Paul wrote with regard to a man who had to be removed from the congregation for sexual immorality, as indicated in 1 Corinthians chapter 5. But that man was apparently not an apostate; nor was he actively teaching others to violate God’s standards. (Compare Revelation 2:20.) So while Paul directed those in the congregation to stop keeping company with him​—not even eating with him—​he did not state that they must never say a simple greeting.


IMITATING JEHOVAH’S COMPASSION AND MERCY
16-17. (a) What does Jehovah want sinners to do? (Ezekiel 18:32) (b) How can elders show themselves to be fellow workers with Jehovah when trying to help wrongdoers?

Your answers


16 What have we learned in this five-part series? Jehovah does not want anyone to be destroyed! (Read Ezekiel 18:32.) He wants sinners to be reconciled to him. (2 Cor. 5:20) That is why throughout history, Jehovah has repeatedly urged his wayward people​—as well as wayward individuals—​to repent and return to him. Congregation elders are privileged to be fellow workers with Jehovah as they strive to lead wrongdoers to repentance.​—Rom. 2:4; 1 Cor. 3:9.
17 Imagine the joy in heaven when sinners repent! Our heavenly Father, Jehovah, personally experiences that joy every time one of his lost sheep returns to the congregation. Our love for Jehovah continues to deepen as we meditate on his compassion, mercy, and undeserved kindness.​—Luke 1:78.

SONG 111 Our Reasons for Joy

a In this article, we refer to the wrongdoer as a male. However, the information discussed also applies to females.
b We will no longer refer to such ones as being disfellowshipped. In harmony with Paul’s words recorded at 1 Corinthians 5:13, we will now refer to them as being removed from the congregation.
c According to the Bible, an unforgivable sin is not a particular type of sin but a sin that is committed with a hardened attitude that is permanently opposed to God. Whether a person has committed such a sin is not for us to judge.​—Mark 3:29; Heb. 10:26, 27.
