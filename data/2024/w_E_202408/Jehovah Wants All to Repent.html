In the Bible, a person who repents changes his mind about a certain kind of behavior, stops behaving in that way, and is determined not to repeat it.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077253/">Repentance</a>.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Every human alive needs to learn about repentance. Why? Because we all sin daily. As descendants of Adam and Eve, each of us has inherited sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>) Not one of us is exempt. Even outstanding men of faith, such as the apostle Paul, struggled against sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-24</a>) Does this mean that we should be miserable all the time because of our sins? No, Jehovah is merciful, and he wants us to be happy. Consider the experience of the Jews in Nehemiah’s day. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:9-16:8:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Nehemiah 8:9-11</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jehovah did not want them to be grief-stricken over past sins but wanted them to be joyful in their worship of him. Jehovah knows that repentance leads to happiness. So he teaches us about it. If we repent of our sins, we can be confident that our merciful Father will forgive us.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> When Jehovah organized the Israelites into a nation, he made a covenant, a formal agreement, with them. If they kept his laws, he would protect and bless them. Regarding those laws, he assured them: “Now this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it beyond your reach.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:11-5:30:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 30:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:16-5:30:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 16</a>) But if they rebelled against him​—for example, by choosing to worship other gods—​he would withdraw his blessing, and they would suffer. Yet, even then, they could still regain God’s favor. They could “return to Jehovah [their] God and listen to his voice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:1-5:30:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 30:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:17-5:30:20" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 17-20</a>) In other words, they could repent.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jehovah often used his prophets to warn and correct his people. For example, God said through Jeremiah: “Return, O renegade Israel . . . I will not look down angrily on you, for I am loyal . . . I will not stay resentful forever. Only acknowledge your guilt, for you have rebelled against Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:12-24:3:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 3:12, 13</a>) By means of Joel, Jehovah said: “Return to me with all your hearts.” <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:12-29:2:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joel 2:12, 13</a>) He had Isaiah declare: “Make yourselves clean; remove your evil deeds from my sight; stop doing bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:16-23:1:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 1:16-19</a>) And by means of Ezekiel, Jehovah asked: “Do I take any pleasure at all in the death of a wicked person? . . . Do I not prefer that he turn away from his ways and keep living? I do not take any pleasure in the death of anyone, . . . so turn back and live.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:23-26:18:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:32-26:18:32" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 32</a>) Jehovah takes delight in seeing people repent because he wants them to keep living​—forever! So Jehovah does not just wait passively for sinful people to change before he offers them help. Let us see some other examples of this.</p>

After committing adultery, she left Hosea for other men. Was she beyond help? Jehovah, who can read hearts, told Hosea: “Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and <strong><em>is committing adultery,</em></strong> just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel while they turn to other gods.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:1-28:3:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hos. 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:2-20:16:2" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Prov. 16:2</a>) Note that Hosea’s wife was still involved in a course of serious sin.

Even though they were caught up in terrible sins, he still loved them and continued to reach out and help them to repent and change their ways. Does this example suggest that Jehovah, “the examiner of hearts,” will reach out to an individual who is still involved in serious sin and try to lead that one to repentance?

Instead of changing his ways, “Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.” What did Jehovah do next? He spoke to Cain. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:3-1:4:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 4:3-7</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Note that Jehovah reasoned kindly with Cain, offering him hope and warning him against the danger of sin. Sadly, Cain refused to listen. He did not let Jehovah lead him to repentance. After that negative response, did Jehovah stop trying to lead other sinners to repentance? Far from it!</p>

As mentioned in the preceding article, Jehovah used both John the Baptist and Jesus Christ to teach people how important it is to repent.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:1-40:3:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 3:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 4:17</a>.</p>

That young man <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>chose to pursue a sinful way of life for some time. Yet, he “came to his senses” and returned home. How did the father respond? Jesus said that while the son “was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him.” The son intended to ask if he could become a servant in his father’s household, but his father called him “this son of mine” and restored him to his place in the family. The father said: “He was lost and has been found.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:11-42:15:32" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 15:11-32</a>) When Jesus lived in heaven before coming to earth, he had surely seen his Father show such compassion toward countless repentant sinners.

Yet, he lovingly urged them: “Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing may come from Jehovah himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:14-44:3:15" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 3:14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:17-44:3:17" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 19</a>) Peter thus showed that repentance moves a sinner to turn around​—to change his wrong way of thinking and acting—​and to pursue a new course, one pleasing to God. The apostle also showed that Jehovah would blot out their sins, or cause their sins to disappear. And decades later, Peter assured Christians: “Jehovah . . . is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9</a>) What a beautiful hope for Christians when they commit sins​—even serious ones!</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[62]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Few people have ever needed to repent and be forgiven more than Saul of Tarsus. He was a vicious persecutor of Christ’s beloved followers. Most Christians likely viewed him as a lost cause, beyond any hope of repentance. Yet, the resurrected Jesus was far above such flawed human reasoning. He and his Father saw good qualities in Saul. Jesus said: “This man is a chosen vessel to me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:15-44:9:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 9:15</a>) Jesus even used a miracle to lead Saul to repentance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:58-44:8:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 7:58–8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:9" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 9:1-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:17-44:9:20" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 17-20</a>) After becoming a Christian, Saul​—later known as the apostle Paul—​often expressed his appreciation for the way he had been shown kindness and mercy. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:12-54:1:15" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 1:12-15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The grateful apostle taught: “God in his kindness is trying to lead you to repentance.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:4-45:2:4" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rom. 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[62]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> When Paul heard about a scandalous problem regarding immorality in the Christian congregation in Corinth, how did he handle it? He did so in a way that teaches us a great deal about Jehovah’s loving discipline and about the importance of showing mercy. We will consider that account in greater detail in the following article.</p>

Today, Jehovah does not require that an innocent victim of adultery remain married to the adulterer. In fact, Jehovah directed his Son to make a provision for such victims of adultery to seek a divorce if they choose to do so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:32-40:5:32" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 19:9</a>.</p></div>
