<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The Kingdom Hall is a center for learning that focuses on practical Bible education. The meetings held there can help you:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  learn the truth about God.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  understand the meaning behind current events.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  become a better person.</p>

<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong> </strong> find the best kind of friends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>Did you know?</em> The meeting place of Jehovah’s Witnesses is called a Kingdom Hall because God’s Kingdom is prominently discussed there.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:​9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 4:​43</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Why should you attend?</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>The information will help you.</strong> The Bible principles discussed at the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses will help you “acquire wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:5-20:4:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:5</a>) That means the Bible can actually help you make good decisions in life. It can also help you answer life’s big questions, including:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>The following are just a few titles of the talks that are given at our weekend meetings:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  Why Be Guided by the Bible?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  Where Can You Get Help in Times of Distress?</p>

<blockquote><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“A classmate came to one of the meetings. He sat with our family, and we shared our books with him. Afterward, he told me that he was really impressed with the comments people gave during the audience-participation parts. He also said that at his church they don’t have study material like we do.”​—Brenda.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>Did you know?</em> Seats are free at the Kingdom Hall, and no collections are ever taken.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>The association will encourage you.</strong> The Bible says that one reason Christians should meet together is to be “encouraging one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) Good association among people who put God and others before themselves is refreshing in this largely self-centered world.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><em>“After a long day, I may feel sad and run-down, but the people at the Kingdom Hall always make me feel better. On my way home after a meeting, I feel happy and ready to tackle another day.”​—Elisa.</em></p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><em>Did you know?</em> There are more than 120,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world, meeting at more than 60,000 locations. Each year, on average, about 1,500 Kingdom Halls are built to accommodate the increase in attenders.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
