<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Why some drop out</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Common reasons noted by educators include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Academic struggles.</strong> ‘I’m losing the battle against failing grades.’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Apathy.</strong> ‘I see no value in what I’m learning.’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Economic hardship.</strong> ‘I have to work to help support my family.’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>Count the cost</strong></h2>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The Bible says: “The shrewd one ponders each step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>) The lesson? If you’re considering dropping out of school, be sure to count the cost.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>  ‘How will dropping out affect future job opportunities?’</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“Think about having to get a job and then possibly providing for a family one day. How can you do that if most employers require at least a high school diploma?”—Julia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>  ‘How will dropping out affect my ability to deal with hardship?’</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“School prepares you for life. In the future, the people you meet, the temptations you encounter, and the work you do will be similar to what you faced in school.”—Daniel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>  ‘How will dropping out affect my life skills?’</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em>“School may seem impractical now, but when you are 23 years old and balancing your checkbook, you’re going to think, ‘I’m glad I paid attention in math.’”—Anna.</em></p>

<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>A better approach</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>  Get help.</strong> The Bible says: “There is success through many advisers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:14-20:11:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:14</a>) If your grades are slipping, reach out to a parent, a teacher, a guidance counselor, or another trusted adult for tips on how to improve.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>“Talk to your teacher if you’re struggling. Sometimes you might think that the teacher is the problem, but often you can improve the situation just by asking for help.”—Edward.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  <strong>Look at the big picture.</strong> The Bible says: “Better is the end of a matter than its beginning.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:8-21:7:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>) When you finish school, you will have acquired qualities and skills that go beyond the subjects you were taught.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>“You may not have to write essays or study for exams as an adult, but the way you handle stress at school prepares you for the challenges you will face after you graduate.”—Vera.</em></p>
