<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Why talk face-to-face?</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Some people say that face-to-face conversation is difficult and stressful, especially when they compare it to texting.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><em>“There’s more pressure when you talk face-to-face because you can’t edit or delete anything you say.”—Anna.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“Texting is like a prerecorded program, whereas talking in person is like a live show. All I can think when I talk is, ‘Don’t mess up!’”—Jean.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Sooner or later, though, you’ll need in-person conversation skills. For example, you will need these skills if you hope to make new friends, to get and keep a job, or to start a romantic relationship when you’re ready for it.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The good news is, face-to-face conversation doesn’t have to be terrifying. You <em>can</em> learn to manage it—even if you’re timid.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t worry about making mistakes. Developing conversation skills is like learning how to ride a bike. You may “fall” a few times, but with practice, you <em>will</em> get better at it—and you’ll enjoy the ride!</p>

<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>How to start a conversation</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>  Ask questions.</strong> Think of a topic that might interest people, and then turn it into a conversation starter. For example:</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“Did you travel anywhere this past summer?”</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“This is a cool website. Have you seen it before?”</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“Did you hear about . . . ?”</em></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>To be even more specific, think of something you have in common with the person. For example, do you attend the same school or work at the same job? Use what you have in common as a basis for your questions.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Questions like the ones above can be good conversation starters. When possible, though, use open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no reply. For example, the open-ended question “What was your favorite part of the movie?” is likely to get a better response than “Did you enjoy the movie?”</p>

</aside></div>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Caution:</strong> Don’t become an interrogator by asking one question after another. Also, try not to be too personal. Questions like “What’s your greatest fear?” or “Why do you always wear blue?” may come across that way. The second question may even seem critical!</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>You can also avoid sounding like an interrogator if either before or after the person answers, you share your own viewpoint on the question you asked. In other words, make it a conversation—not an interview.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> If there’s a lag in the conversation, don’t panic. Notice your surroundings.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Give the person a sincere compliment, and then follow it up with a question. For example, “That’s a nice coat. Where did you get it?”</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong>Caution:</strong> Don’t get too personal. A compliment like “That’s a nice coat. How much did it cost?” might cross the line!</p>
