<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>The problems with cliques</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>There’s nothing wrong with having a tight-knit group of friends. Having a close circle of friends gives you a sense of belonging and a place where you are accepted for who you are​—flaws and all.</p>
<blockquote class="noIndent"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“It feels good to be liked by others and to be part of a group. When you’re young, you just want to fit in.”​—Karen, 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> Jesus’ 12 apostles were among his many friends, but three of those apostles​—Peter, James, and John​—were his closest companions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:2-41:9:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 9:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:51-42:8:51" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 8:​51</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>However, associating with <em>only</em> an exclusive group of friends​—and shutting out others​—can create problems. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  It can close the door to other potentially great friendships.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“Having only friends who are similar to you closes you off to new experiences​—and to fantastic people.”​—Evan, 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  It can make you appear snobbish.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“When you have an exclusive group of friends, you can give off the vibe that you don’t want to talk to anyone else.”​—Sara, 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  It can lead you to take part in bullying.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em>“An individual might not bully someone, but if your circle of friends does it, suddenly it seems OK​—even funny.”​—James, 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  It can get you into trouble​—especially if you want to belong to that group at any price.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“All it takes is one bad person in a tight-knit group for the whole group to be swayed into wrongdoing.”​—Martina, 17.</em></p>

<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Examine your values.</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Ask yourself: ‘What values do I strive to live by? Do my friends make it easier or harder for me to live by those values? Would I hold on to those friends at any price?’</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>Bible principle: “Bad associations corrupt good morals.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, footnote.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>  <strong>Examine your priorities.</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>Ask yourself: ‘Is my circle of friends so tight that I would compromise my standards to preserve it? What would I do if a friend did something wrong?’</p>

<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>  <strong>Expand your friendships.</strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>Ask yourself: ‘Could I benefit by widening my circle of friends to include some I do not know as well?’</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> There’s nothing wrong with having a close-knit group of friends. At the same time, you may benefit from expanding your circle of friends to include others.
