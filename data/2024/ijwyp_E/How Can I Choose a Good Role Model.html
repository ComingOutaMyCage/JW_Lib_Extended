<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Your choice of role models will influence how you act.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The Bible tells Christians to take note of those who are exemplary, saying: “As you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Since your choice of role models will influence you for the good or for the bad, select those who have truly commendable qualities, not merely those who are popular or who are close to your age.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“I learned a lot from a fellow Christian named Adam​—both from his attitude and from his overall demeanor. It’s amazing how I still remember specific things he said and did. He has no idea of the effect he had on me.”​—Colin.</em></p>

</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Your choice of role models will affect how you think and feel.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The Bible states: “Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose someone who has good qualities, not merely an impressive outer appearance. Otherwise, you may be setting yourself up for disappointment.</p>

<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>How to choose</strong></h2>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>You can select a role model in one of two ways.</p>
<ol><li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>             You can pick a quality you want to work on and then find someone you admire who has that quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>             You can choose someone you admire and then select a quality he or she displays that you want to develop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>The worksheet that accompanies this article can help you do that.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>Your role models can include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Peers.</strong> “My best friend is someone I want to be like. She is never too busy to stop and show concern for someone else. She is younger than I am, but I see in her beautiful qualities that I lack, and it makes me want to follow her example.”​—Miriam.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Adults.</strong> These can be your parents or members of your faith. “Without a doubt, both of my parents are role models for me. They have wonderful qualities. I do see their faults, but I also see that they are still faithful despite them. When I am their age, I hope the same can be said of me.”​—Annette.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>Bible characters.</strong> “I have chosen several role models from the Bible​—Timothy, Ruth, Job, Peter, the little Israelite girl​—each for a different reason. The more I learn about Bible characters, the more real they become. I’ve really enjoyed studying the accounts in the book <em>Imitate Their Faith</em><em>,</em> as well as the ‘Role Model Index’ found in both volumes of the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work.”</em>​—Melinda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t limit yourself to only one role model. The apostle Paul said to fellow Christians: “Keep your eye on <em>those</em> who are walking in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:17-50:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Philippians 3:​17</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> <em>You</em> can be someone’s role model! The Bible says: “Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:12-54:4:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:​12</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><em>“You can be a work in progress and still help others to be better at the same time. You never know who is watching, and you never know how what you say can change a person’s life.”​—Kiana.</em></p>
