<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Why manage your time?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>  Time is like money. If you waste it, you won’t have it when you need it. On the other hand, if you budget your time, you will have some left over to do the things you enjoy!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “The lazy person has his cravings, yet he has nothing, but the diligent one will be fully satisfied.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:4-20:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Managing your time will give you <em>more</em> freedom, not <em>less.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Time management is a valuable skill that will serve you well in adulthood. It can even make the difference between your holding down a job and being fired. After all, if you ran a business, would <em>you</em> keep an employee who repeatedly showed up late for work?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:10-42:16:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The ability to manage time says something about the kind of person you are.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Admittedly, though, time management isn’t easy. Consider just a few obstacles.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Obstacle #1: Friends</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“If friends ask me to go out with them, I almost always make it happen even if I really don’t have the time. I think, ‘Oh, I can do a rush job when I get home.’ It doesn’t always work, and things have gone very wrong as a result.”​—Cynthia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Obstacle #2: Distractions</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“TV is like a vacuum cleaner. It sucks you in with its shows and movies, which are hard to resist.”​—Ivy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“I can waste hours on my tablet. I feel guilty when the only thing that stops me is if the battery dies.”​—Marie.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Obstacle #3: Procrastination</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em>“I procrastinate on my school assignments and on anything else I need to get done. I’ll waste my time doing something stupid until I absolutely have to get my assignment finished​—not exactly the best time management.”​—Beth.</em></p>

<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ol><li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>               <strong>List your required tasks.</strong> Examples include your household chores and homework. Write down how much time you need to complete each task in a typical week.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Make sure of the more important things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 1:​10</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>               <strong>List the activities you like to do in your free time.</strong> This could include such activities as social networking and watching TV. Again, write down how many hours you spend on each activity in a typical week.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Go on walking in wisdom . . . , making the best use of your time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:5-51:4:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 4:5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>               <strong>Create a plan.</strong> Look back at the two lists you created. Is enough time allocated for the important tasks? Do you need to buy out time from your leisure activities?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>Tip: Make a daily to-do list, checking off each item as it is finished.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>               <strong>Follow through.</strong> True, you might have to turn down a social invitation now and then to get the important things done. Overall, however, you will find that you have more free time​—and you will <em>enjoy</em> it more.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Be industrious, do not loiter at your business.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 12:11</a>, footnote.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>               <strong>Reward yourself​—but not too soon.</strong> “Sometimes I will complete two things on my to-do list,” says a young woman named Tara, “and then I’ll think, ‘OK, I can watch TV for 15 minutes and then I’ll get back to work.’ Well, 15 minutes turns into 30, and 30 minutes turns into an hour, and before I know it, I’ve wasted two hours on TV!”</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>The solution? View recreation as a reward for <em>completing</em> your tasks​—not as an automatic part of your day.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “There is nothing better for a man than to . . . find enjoyment in his hard work.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:​24</a>.</p>
