<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>  <strong>No human relationship is problem free.</strong> Being imperfect, your good friend​—even someone you consider to be your <em>best</em> friend​—might do or say something that hurts you. Of course, you too are imperfect. So in all fairness, can you not recall a time when you hurt someone else?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>.</p>

And then you can start to feel betrayed and sad.”</p>
