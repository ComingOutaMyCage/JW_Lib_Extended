<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa"><em>Alex is confused. He has always believed in God and in creation. But today his biology teacher forcefully claimed that evolution is a fact, that it is based on credible scientific research.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Can you identify with this scenario? Perhaps for all your life, you’ve believed what the Bible says: “God created the heavens and the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>) Yet, recently people have been trying to convince you that creation is a myth and that evolution is a fact. Should you believe them? Why question evolution?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>To think about:</em> If scientists can’t agree on evolution​—and they’re supposed to be the experts​—are you wrong to question the theory?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:4-19:10:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 10:4</a>.</p>

He has a point. After all, if evolution were true, life would not seem to have any lasting purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:32-46:15:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>) On the other hand, if creation is true, we can find satisfying answers to questions about the purpose of life and what the future holds.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:11</a>.</p>
