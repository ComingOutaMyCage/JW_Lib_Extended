<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Why do parents intrude?</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Your parents say they’re just concerned. You, however, see it as an invasion of your privacy. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  “My dad will take my phone, demand my password, and look through all my messages,” says a teenager named Erin. “If I get defensive, he thinks I have something to hide.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Denise, now in her early 20’s, recalls her mom scrutinizing the phone bill. “She would look at each number and ask me whom it belonged to and what I had talked to that person about.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  A teenager named Kayla says that her mom read one of her private journals. “It had lots of my feelings in it​—even some things about <em>her!</em> I stopped writing in a journal after that.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Your parents are responsible for your well-being, and you can’t control just how strictly they’ll exercise that responsibility. Will they seem to go overboard at times? Perhaps. The good news is that there are things <em>you</em> can do to reduce that feeling of intrusion.</p>
<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Be open.</strong> The Bible encourages us to “conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>) Make an effort to do that with your parents. The more honest and open you are with them, the more likely they will be to allow you more privacy.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>To think about: What is your track record when it comes to trustworthiness? Are you careless about your curfew? secretive about your friendships? elusive about your activities?</p>
<blockquote><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span> <em>“I have to meet my parents halfway. I’m open with them about what’s going on in my life. I tell them whatever they want to know, and as a result, they trust me and give me privacy.”​—Delia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Be patient.</strong> The Bible says: “Keep proving what you yourselves are.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:13:5-47:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>) It takes time to build up a record of trustworthy behavior, but it’s worth the effort.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>To think about: At one time your parents were teenagers. What bearing do you think that fact has on their interest in your life?</p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“I think parents remember the mistakes they made and don’t want their teenagers to make the same ones.”​—Daniel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Try to see things from your parents’ point of view. The Bible says that a capable wife “watches over the activity of her household” and that a good father brings up his children “in the discipline and guidance of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:27-20:31:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:4</a>, footnote) To accomplish that, there’s no shortcut: your parents need to be involved in your life.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>To think about: If you were a parent​—knowing what you know about teenagers​—would <em>you</em> allow your son or daughter to have total privacy, with no questions asked?</p>
<blockquote><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span> <em>“When you’re a teen, it seems as if your parents are ‘invading’ your privacy. Now that I’m a young adult, though, I can see why parents need to do it. It’s a reflection of their love.”​—James.</em></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24">“When I was a teenager, my mom would always come into my room and ask me how my day was and how I was feeling. At the time, I felt that it was an invasion of my privacy. Now, in hindsight, I think it was really sweet that she cared about me enough to spend that time with me.”​—Lauren.</p>
