<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The idea of moving out can be exciting and scary at the same time. How do you know if you’re ready to live on your own?</p>
<ul class="noMarker noIndent"><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502018160/7"><strong>Examine your reasons</strong></a></p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Examine your reasons</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>There are plenty of reasons you might decide to leave home​—some of them not too wise. For example, a young man named Mario admits, “I wanted to move out so I could escape the responsibilities I had at home.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The fact is, you’ll probably have <em>less</em> freedom if you move out. “If you leave home,” says 18-year-old Onya, “you’ll have to take care of your own place, provide your own meals, pay your own bills​—and you won’t have parents down the hallway to help you out!”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> You need to understand <em>why</em> you want to leave home in order to know whether you’re ready.</p>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Count the cost</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Jesus said: “Who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:28-42:14:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 14:28</a>) How can you “calculate the expense” of leaving home? Examine yourself in the following areas.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span> <strong>CAN YOU HANDLE MONEY RESPONSIBLY?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The Bible says: “Money is a protection.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:​12</a>.</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Do you have trouble saving?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Are you a compulsive spender?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Do you often find yourself borrowing from others?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>If you answered yes to any of those questions, the dream of living on your own could turn into a nightmare!</p>
<blockquote><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“My brother left home when he was 19. Within a year, his savings were gone, his car was repossessed, his credit was damaged, and he was begging to come back home.”​—Danielle.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>What you can do now:</strong> Ask your parents what their typical expenses are for a month. What bills do they receive, and how do they budget their income to pay for those bills? How do they save?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Learning how to handle money now while you’re living at home will prepare you to face the harsh financial realities of life on your own.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span> <strong>ARE YOU SELF-DISCIPLINED?</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>The Bible says: “Each one will carry his own load.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>.</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>Are you a procrastinator?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Do your parents have to remind you to do your chores?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>Do you often break your curfew?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>If you answered yes to any of those questions, you’ll probably find it even <em>more</em> difficult to be responsible when you’re living on your own.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><em>“When you’re on your own, there are things you don’t particularly enjoy but simply must make time for. No one is going to tell you to do those things, so you need to be self-motivated and able to keep a routine.”​—Jessica.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>What you can do now:</strong> For an entire month, try taking on as many responsibilities as you can around the home. For example, clean the house by yourself, wash your own clothes, shop for groceries, cook a meal each night, and wash the dishes afterward. This will give you an idea of what you’ll face when you live on your own.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Self-discipline is essential if you are to live independently.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><em>“Living with roommates revealed my weaknesses. I learned that I couldn’t expect others to tolerate my foul moods caused by stress. I had to find a healthier way to deal with it.”​—Helena.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>What you can do now:</strong> Learn to get along with your parents and siblings. After all, how you handle the imperfections of those you live with <em>now</em> is an indication of how you will handle the imperfections of anyone you live with later.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Living on your own isn’t an escape​—it’s a skill that requires preparation. Why not talk to those who have succeeded at it? Ask them, in hindsight, what they would have done differently or what they wish they had known then that they know now. That’s good to do regarding <em>any</em> major decision you make!</p>
