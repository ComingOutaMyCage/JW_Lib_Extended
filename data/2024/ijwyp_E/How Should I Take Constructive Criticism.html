<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>At times, we all need constructive criticism, meaning advice that can help us improve in our work or attitude. With that in mind, consider the following scenarios.</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">● </span>Your teacher tells you that your last school project seemed to be rushed. “You need to put more time into research,” he says.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>How do you react to the constructive criticism?</p>
<ol class="upperAlpha"><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>            Reject it. (‘The teacher just doesn’t like me.’)</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>            Accept it. (‘I’ll take his advice for my next project.’)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">● </span>Your mother tells you that your room is a mess—even though you just cleaned it.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>How do you react to the constructive criticism?</p>
<ol class="upperAlpha"><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>            Reject it. (‘She’s never satisfied.’)</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>            Accept it. (‘I admit that I could have done a better job.’)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">● </span>Your younger sister tells you that she doesn’t like your bossy attitude.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>How do you react to the constructive criticism?</p>
<ol class="upperAlpha"><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>            Reject it. (‘Who is <em>she</em> to talk about being bossy?’)</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>            Accept it. (‘I guess I <em>could</em> treat her more kindly.’)</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Some young people have been called teacups—so fragile that they shatter at the smallest dose of constructive criticism. Are you like that? If so, you’re missing out! Why? Because learning to take constructive criticism is an important skill that will serve you well both now and in adulthood.</p>

<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>Why do I need constructive criticism?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  <strong>Because you’re not perfect.</strong> The Bible says: “We all make mistakes many times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>, footnote) For that reason, everyone needs constructive feedback.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“I try to remember that we are all imperfect and that making mistakes is a part of life. So when I receive correction, I try to learn from it and avoid repeating the mistake.”—David.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Because you can do better.</strong> The Bible says: “Share with a wise person, and he will become wiser.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:9-20:9:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 9:9</a>) Constructive feedback can benefit you—if you accept it.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><em>“I used to have the wrong view of criticism. I thought it made me look bad. But now I accept it and even ask for it. I want to know how I can improve.”—Selena.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>Of course, it’s one thing to <em>ask</em> for constructive criticism. But when it comes uninvited, that can be another story. “I was horrified and discouraged,” says Natalie, recalling a card she received that contained some unsolicited advice. “I was trying so hard, and all I got for it was counsel!”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>Has something similar ever happened to you? If so, how can you deal with it?</p>
<h2 id="p29" data-pid="29"><strong>How can I accept constructive criticism?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>  <strong>Listen.</strong></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>The Bible says: “A man of knowledge restrains his words, and a discerning man will remain calm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:27-20:17:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:27</a>) Don’t interrupt the person who is talking to you. And don’t respond impulsively, saying something that you will regret later!</p>
<blockquote><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><em>“When I receive criticism, I’m inclined to get defensive. Instead, I should learn from the correction and do things better next time.”—Sara.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>  Focus on the message, not the messenger.</strong></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>You might be tempted to point out the flaws of your critic. But it’s far better to follow the Bible’s advice to “be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 1:19</a>) There is usually some truth to criticism. Don’t miss out on what you <em>need</em> to hear just because you don’t <em>want</em> to hear it.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><em>“I used to get angry and say, ‘I know, I know,’ when my parents gave me correction. But when I really listen to them and apply their advice, there are much better results.”—Edward.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>  <strong>Keep a balanced view of yourself.</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>The fact that you received constructive criticism doesn’t make you a failure. It simply means that you have flaws, like everyone else. Even the person correcting you needs constructive criticism now and then. In fact, the Bible says: “There is no righteous man on earth who always does good.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><em>“A friend gave me constructive criticism that I didn’t think I needed. I thanked her for her honesty, but I was offended. In time, though, I realized that her criticism had some truth to it. Thanks to her advice, I was able to see what I needed to work on—something I would otherwise have probably overlooked.”—Sophia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span>  <strong>Set a goal to improve.</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span>The Bible says that “a shrewd person accepts correction.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:5-20:15:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:5</a>) Once you accept it, you will be able to bypass any hurt feelings and get busy improving in the area that was pointed out to you. Create an action plan to do so, and track your progress over the next few months.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span><em>“Dealing with criticism is linked with honesty because you have to be honest with yourself to admit your mistakes, apologize for them, and learn how to improve.”—Emma.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The Bible says: “People learn from one another, just as iron sharpens iron.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:17-20:27:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:17</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>) Constructive criticism is a tool that can sharpen <em>you,</em> both now and when you become an adult.</p>
