<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>What makes you anxious?</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Do the following statements describe how <em>you</em> feel at times?</p>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><em>“I’m constantly thinking: ‘What if . . . ?’ ‘What if we get in a car accident?’ ‘What if our plane goes down?’ I’m anxious about things that a more rational person wouldn’t worry so much about.”​—Charles.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“I feel anxious all the time, as though I were a hamster on a wheel running around but never getting anywhere. I’m working myself to death but not really accomplishing anything!”​—Anna.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>“When people tell me that I’m fortunate that I’m still in school, I say to myself, ‘They have no idea how stressful school is!’”​—Daniel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“I’m like a pressure cooker. I’m always worried about the next thing that will happen or the next thing I need to do.”​—Laura.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Fact of life:</strong> We live in what the Bible calls “critical times hard to deal with.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Because of that, anxiety can affect young people as much as it affects adults.</p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Is anxiety always bad?</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The answer is no. In fact, the Bible says that it is right for people to be anxious to please the ones they love.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:32-46:7:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:​32-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:28-47:11:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 11:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Also, let’s face it​—anxiety can be a powerful motivator. For example, suppose you will be taking a test at school next week. Anxiety might compel you to study <em>this</em> week​—and <em>that</em> might help you get a better grade!</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>A degree of anxiety can also alert you to danger. “You might feel anxious because you know that you’re taking a wrong course of action and that you need to make changes for your conscience to be at rest,” says a teenager named Serena.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 5:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Fact of life:</strong> Anxiety can work <em>for</em> you​—as long as it moves you to the right kind of action.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>But what if anxiety traps you in a maze of negative thinking?</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Example:</strong> “My mind races when I think about the different ways a stressful situation could turn out,” says 19-year-old Richard. “I play the situation over and over in my mind to the point that it makes me very anxious.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>The Bible says that “a calm heart gives life to the body.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:30-20:14:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:30</a>) On the other hand, anxiety can bring on a number of unpleasant physical symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, and heart palpitations.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>What can you do if anxiety seems to be working <em>against</em> you rather than <em>for</em> you?</p>
<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>  Question the reasonableness of your anxiety.</strong> <em>“Being concerned about your responsibilities is one thing; being overly anxious is another. It reminds me of the saying, Anxiety is like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but it doesn’t get you anywhere.”​—Katherine.</em></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:27-40:6:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>What this means:</strong> Unless anxiety leads you toward a solution, it will only add to your problem​—or <em>become</em> your problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  <strong>Take things one day at a time.</strong> <em>“Think it through. Will what you are anxious about matter tomorrow? in a month? in a year? in five years?”​—Anthony.</em></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>What this means:</strong> It makes little sense to take on tomorrow’s problems​—some of which may never even become a reality.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>  Learn to live with what you cannot change.</strong> <em>“The best you can do is prepare for situations to the extent possible, but accept the fact that some situations are out of your control.”​—Robert.</em></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “The swift do not always win the race, . . . nor do those with knowledge always have success, because time and unexpected events overtake them all.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>What this means:</strong> Sometimes you cannot change your circumstances, but you can change the way you view them.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>  Put your situation in perspective.</strong> <em>“I find that I have to focus on the big picture and not stress over the details. I have to choose my battles and channel my energy into taking care of priorities.”​—Alexis.</em></p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Make sure of the more important things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Philippians 1:​10</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong>What this means:</strong> People who put their anxieties in perspective are less likely to be overwhelmed by them.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><strong>  Talk to someone.</strong> <em>“When I was in the sixth grade, I would come home from school very anxious, dreading the next day. My mother and father would just listen to me as I expressed myself. It was so good to have them there. I could trust them and speak freely to them. It helped me to face the next day.”​—Marilyn.</em></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, but a good word cheers it up.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>What this means:</strong> A parent or a friend might be able to give you practical suggestions on how to reduce your anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>  Pray.</strong> <em>“Praying​—and doing so aloud so I can hear my voice​—helps me. It allows me to vocalize what I am anxious about instead of keeping it in my head. It also helps me to realize that Jehovah is greater than my anxiety.”​—Laura.</em></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Throw all your anxiety on [God], because he cares for you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span><strong>What this means:</strong> Prayer is not a mental trick. It is real communication with Jehovah God, who promises: “Do not be anxious, for I am your God. I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:10</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p43" data-pid="43">Some young people suffer from chronic anxiety. For example, a teenager named Jenna says: “As a result of anxiety, I had a constant headache, I couldn’t focus, I would sleep for days or not sleep for days, I wouldn’t eat, or I would eat too much​—I was wired all the time. Very small problems seemed like mountains.”</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44">When anxiety is prolonged or excessive, it might be good for you to get a medical checkup. That’s what Jenna did. “After receiving treatment, I can handle things better and I have control over my anxiety,” she says.</p>
