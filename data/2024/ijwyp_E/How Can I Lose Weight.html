<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Do I really need to lose weight?</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Some teenagers say that they want to lose weight. However . . .</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <strong>Many are more concerned about their appearance than their health.</strong> To shed pounds, some resort to quick fixes, like skipping meals or taking weight-loss pills. Such methods usually prove futile and are sometimes even dangerous.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“Some girls starve themselves to get faster results. This usually backfires, and then it takes a long time for their body to recover from the damage.”—Hailey.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Many who are concerned about their weight should not be.</strong> Their weight is fine—but perhaps they feel fat when they compare themselves with their peers or with the skinny “ideal” that the media promotes.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“When I was 13, I compared myself to my friends. I thought they would like me more if I looked like them—which meant that I had to be stick-thin.”—Paola.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>On the other hand, some young people really do need to lose weight. According to a World Health Organization report . . .</p>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Globally, some 340 million youths between the ages of 5 and 19 are overweight.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  In 1975 just 4 percent of those in the 5-19 age bracket were overweight. By 2016 the figure had risen to 18 percent.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  For most lands around the world, it is more common for people to be obese than to be underweight.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  Obesity is also common in low-income countries, even in households where some members are undernourished.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>What’s the best way to lose weight?</strong></h2>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Which method would you choose?</p>
<ol><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>             Skip meals.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>             Combine exercise with a balanced diet.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>             Take weight-loss pills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Correct answer:</strong> Method 2: Combine exercise with a balanced diet.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>Skipping meals or cutting out a food group might get quick results. But those methods may not be healthy, and you’ll likely regain the weight once you return to your usual eating habits.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>On the other hand, if you make it your goal to be healthy, you will look and feel your best. “The safest, healthiest, and most long-lasting results come from . . . altering your lifestyle in ways that you can maintain for the rest of your days,” writes Dr. Michael Bradley.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The point? If you need to lose weight, don’t think in terms of following a diet but of adopting a lifestyle change.</p>
<h2 id="p26" data-pid="26"><strong>Action plan</strong></h2>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>The Bible tells us to be “moderate in habits”—and that includes eating habits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:11-54:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:11</a>) It even specifically says to avoid overeating. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:20-20:23:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:34" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 21:34</a>) With those principles in mind, try the following in order to adopt a healthier lifestyle:</p>
