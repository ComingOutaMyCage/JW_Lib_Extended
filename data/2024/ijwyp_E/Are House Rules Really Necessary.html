<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>The right outlook</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Myth:</strong> When you leave home, you’ll be done with rules once and for all.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Rules don’t go away when you move out. You’ll still have to answer to someone​—perhaps an employer, a landlord, or even the government. “I think young people who can’t obey rules at home will be in for a big shock when they live on their own,” says 19-year-old Danielle.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Be obedient to governments and authorities.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:1-56:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 3:1</a>) Learning to deal with your parents’ rules is good training for what you will face in other areas of life as an adult.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Learn to look at the bright side of rules. “My parents’ rules really helped me learn how to choose my friends and manage my time,” says a young man named Jeremy. “Also, the rules kept me from watching too much TV and playing too many video games and allowed me to find more productive activities​—some of which I still enjoy.”</p>
<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>The right approach</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>But what if a rule doesn’t seem to make sense? For example, a young woman named Tamara says: “My parents allowed me to travel to another country, but now that I’m back home, they won’t even let me drive to a city that’s just 20 minutes away!”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>If you are in a similar situation, would it be wrong to talk to your parents about the rule? Not at all! The key is to know <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> to talk to them about it.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>When.</strong> “Only after you have built up a track record of trust by being responsible are you in a position to talk to your parents about adjusting a rule,” says a teenager named Amanda.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>A girl named Daria found that to be true. “It wasn’t until my mom saw my consistent obedience that she considered making a change,” she says. Remember, trust is something you <em>earn,</em> not something you <em>demand.</em></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Observe . . . the commandment of your father, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:20-20:6:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:​20</a>) By following that admonition, you will build up a record of trust with your parents and have a basis for discussion with them.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>How.</strong> “Being respectful and calm is always a better way to communicate with your parents than whining and yelling,” says a young man named Steven.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Daria, quoted earlier, agrees. “When I would argue with my mom, nothing would change,” she says. “In fact, sometimes she would make the rule even more strict.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “A stupid person gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one calmly keeps them in check.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:11-20:29:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:11</a>) Learning self-control will have a huge payoff, not only at home but also at school, at work, and elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Think before you speak. A track record of trustworthy behavior can be undone by a fit of rage. For good reason, the Bible says that “the one who is slow to anger has great discernment.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:29-20:14:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the accompanying worksheet to reason on rules, and if needed, have a discussion with your parents about this topic.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25">“At those times when I thought my parents’ rules were unfair, I had usually just done something to break their trust or I wanted to do something that wouldn’t have been good for me. I realize now that my parents’ rules were for my benefit.”​—Kaley.</p>
