<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>You’ve been dating for awhile, but you’re starting to have doubts. Should you continue the relationship or end it? This article is designed to help you decide.</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Dealing with doubts</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>After dating for awhile, a young man and woman might discover that they’re not as alike as they had first thought. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  One enjoys being at the beach; the other prefers hiking.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  One is an extrovert; the other is reserved.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  One tends to be deceitful; the other is always honest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Note that each of those scenarios is different. The first involves mismatched <strong>interests;</strong> the second involves mismatched <strong>traits;</strong> the third involves mismatched <strong>values.</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Which of those three factors would you find most difficult to deal with if the two of you were to get married? Which, if any, could you both compromise on?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>A husband and wife can differ in their <strong>interests</strong> or <strong>traits,</strong> yet still have a happy marriage. After all, being compatible doesn’t mean being identical. In some cases, a husband and wife learn to share each other’s interests or even benefit from each other’s traits.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>On the other hand, it is vital that the person you marry share your <strong>values</strong>—your spiritual, moral, and ethical convictions. If he or she does not, that is definitely a red flag.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>For example, consider mismatched religious values. The book <em>Fighting for Your Marriage</em> says: “Research consistently shows that mixed-faith couples are much more likely to divorce.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Do not try to work together as equals with unbelievers, for it cannot be done.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>Making the decision</strong></h2>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>The Bible says that those who marry “will have pain and grief.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:28-46:7:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>, <em>The New English Bible</em>) So don’t be surprised if you have some of that now, while you’re dating.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Minor conflicts don’t always mean that the relationship is doomed. The question is, Can you resolve them peacefully? You will both definitely need that skill if you get married.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>On the other hand, frequent or serious disagreements <em>could</em> indicate that the two of you are just not compatible. If that is the case, it’s better to find out now rather than later!</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re unsure about your relationship, talk to a mature married friend.

<h2 id="p27" data-pid="27"><strong>If you decide to break up</strong></h2>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>A breakup can be painful. However, if one or both of you have persistent, serious concerns about the relationship, it may be best to end it.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>How should you go about doing that? Unless circumstances make it advisable, it’s best not to break up by means of a text message or an email. Instead, choose an appropriate time and place to discuss this serious matter together.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><strong>Tip:</strong> During that discussion, be tactful but firm. You don’t need to list the other person’s faults; instead, just focus on why the relationship isn’t working for <em>you.</em></p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>Does a breakup mean that you are a failure? Not at all.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘What have I learned about myself from this relationship? Has the experience revealed any areas in which I need to grow? What would I do differently if I chose to date again?’</p>
