<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Why read the Bible?</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Does the idea of reading the Bible sound less than appealing? If so, it’s understandable. You may think of the Bible as a book with more than a thousand pages of small type and no pictures​—not much competition for TV and videos!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>But think of it this way: If you came across a huge ancient treasure chest, wouldn’t you be curious about what’s inside?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The Bible is just such a treasure chest. It contains many gems of wisdom that will help you to</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Make good decisions</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Get along with your parents</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Find the best kind of friends</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  Cope with stress</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>How can such an ancient book be so practical for our day? It’s because “all Scripture is inspired of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:​16</a>) That means the advice in the Bible comes from the best Source possible.</p>

<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>How should I read the Bible?</strong></h2>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>One way is to read the Bible from cover to cover.</strong> That will give you an overview of the Bible’s message. There are many ways to read the Bible. Consider two examples:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em> </em> You could read the 66 Bible books in the order in which they appear, from Genesis to Revelation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em> </em> You could read the Bible chronologically​—that is, in the order in which the events related actually occurred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:1001061207/">Appendix A7</a> in the <em>New World Translation</em> gives a chronological list of the main events of Jesus’ life on earth.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>A second way to read the Bible is to select an account that relates to a challenge you are facing.</strong> For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>  Would you like to find trustworthy friends?</em> Read the story of Jonathan and David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:1-9:20:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel, chapters 18-​20</a>) Then use the worksheet “<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=502012411&amp;wtlocale=E">How to Find Loyal Friends</a>” to learn practical lessons from the account.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>  Would you like to strengthen your ability to resist temptation?</em> Read the story of how Joseph resisted temptation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:1-1:39:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis, chapter 39</a>) Then use the worksheets “<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=502012445&amp;wtlocale=E">How to Resist Temptation . . . Joseph​—Part 1</a>” and “<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=502012446&amp;wtlocale=E">Falsely Accused! Joseph​—Part 2</a>” to learn practical lessons from the account.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><em>  Would you like to learn how prayer can help you?</em> Read Nehemiah’s experience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah, chapter 2</a>) Then use the worksheet “<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=502013226&amp;wtlocale=E">God Answered His Prayer</a>” to learn practical lessons from the account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> When you read the Bible, make sure your surroundings are quiet so that you can concentrate.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>A third way to read the Bible is to pick an account or a psalm, read it, and <em>then</em> consider how it applies to you.</strong> After reading, ask yourself questions such as these:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong> </strong> Why did Jehovah include this in the Bible?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong> </strong> What does it reveal about Jehovah’s personality or way of doing things?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong> </strong> How can I apply this information in my life?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070103/">study edition</a> of the <em>New World Translation</em> to access videos, maps, and other features that will help you get the most out of your Bible reading.</p>
