<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Myths and facts</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>MYTH:</strong> Everyone is having sex (except me).</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>FACT:</strong> In one survey, two out of three 18-year-olds claimed that they had already had sex. But that means a large number—more than 30 percent—had <em>not.</em> Not “everyone” is having sex.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>MYTH:</strong> Sex will strengthen our relationship.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>FACT:</strong> Although some boys may promote that thinking in order to coerce a girl into having sex, the facts say otherwise. All too often, a boy will break up with a girl after having sex with her—much to the outrage of the girl, who thought he was in love with her or at least had some sense of commitment.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>MYTH:</strong> The Bible is against sex.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>FACT:</strong> The Bible promotes a positive view of sex but says that it should only be enjoyed by a man and a woman who are married to each other.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 7:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>MYTH:</strong> Living by the Bible will make my life miserable.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>FACT:</strong> If you wait until marriage to have sex, you will be happier because you will have avoided the worries, regrets, and insecurities that often result from premarital sex.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Postponing sex until marriage has never hurt anyone. But having sex <em>before</em> marriage has.</p>
<h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>How to resist pressure to have sex</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>  Strengthen your moral convictions.</strong> The Bible says that mature people “have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>) They have convictions and are therefore less likely to cave in to pressure.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>“I work very hard to do the right thing and have a good reputation, and I refuse to put myself in a situation that would cause me to lose that.”—Alicia, 16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> What kind of reputation do you want to have? Is it worth sacrificing that reputation just to gain the approval of someone else?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Consider the consequences.</strong> The Bible says: “Whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Fast-forward and think about how your life—and the life of another person—could change if you gave in to the pressure to have sex.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><em>“Premarital sex is often followed by guilt, regret, and even feelings of being unloved—not to mention the possibility of unwanted pregnancy or of getting a sexually-transmitted disease.”—Sienna, 16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> The book <em>Sex Smart</em> asks: “If your friends are pushing you to do things that can mess you up, are they the kind of people you should be hanging out with and listening to about important life issues?”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>  <strong>Have a balanced view.</strong> Sex is not the enemy. In fact, the Bible indicates that married couples should enjoy this aspect of their relationship.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:18, 19</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><em>“Sex is a beautiful part of creation. God wants us to enjoy it, but only under the arrangement that he designed for it, which is marriage.”—Jeremy, 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> If you do get married one day, you <em>will</em> be able to have sex. And you’ll be able to enjoy it fully, without the negative consequences mentioned earlier.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35">“Having premarital sex isn’t the way you show love for someone. You show love by respecting that person—and yourself—enough to wait until marriage. There’s security in marriage because you know that your partner is there for more than something physical.”—Mikayla.</p>
