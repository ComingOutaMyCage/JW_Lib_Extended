<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>How it feels</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>A breakup is bound to cause pain for <em>both</em> parties involved.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>If you initiated the breakup, perhaps you can relate to Jasmine, who says, “Knowing that I hurt someone I cared about was a burden on my conscience that I hope never to carry again.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>If you did <em>not</em> initiate the breakup, you probably understand why some have called the experience a mini-death. “I actually went through the stages of grieving,” says a young woman named Janet, “including denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally​—nearly a year later​—acceptance.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> A breakup can leave you feeling downhearted and despondent. As one Bible writer put it: “A crushed spirit saps one’s strength.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Talk to a mature confidant.</strong> The Bible says: “A true friend shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>) Pouring out your feelings to a parent or a mature friend can help you gain perspective.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>“For months I isolated myself and didn’t talk to anyone about my feelings. But friends can help the healing process. It wasn’t until I opened up to them that I found a measure of relief.”​—Janet.</em></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Learn from what happened.</strong> Another Bible proverb says: “Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:5-20:4:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:5</a>) Unpleasant experiences can teach us a lot about ourselves and how we handle disappointment.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“After the breakup, a friend asked me, ‘What did you learn from the relationship, and how can you use what you learned when you date someone in the future?’”​—Steven.</em></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Pray.</strong> The Bible says: “Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) Prayer can help you work through your grief and view the breakup from a different perspective.</p>
