<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>You might feel as if you were trapped in a maze. But feelings don’t always reflect reality. There are ways to deal with your situation; with the right kind of help, the way out may be closer than you think.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Talk to someone.</strong> There are people who care about you and who want to help. These might include friends and family members who won’t know what you’re going through unless you tell them.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Some people need eyeglasses to help them see things clearly. A friend can fill a similar role, helping you to put your problems in perspective and to regain your desire to live.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Suggestion:</strong> To start a discussion, you could say: “I’ve been having some very negative thoughts lately.

<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>See a physician.</strong> Health problems like anxiety or depression can cause people to lose their desire to live. The good news is that these conditions are treatable.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Get an adequate amount of sleep and exercise, and maintain a nutritious diet. The state of your health can affect your outlook on life.</p>
