<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Why apologize?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <strong>Apologizing shows maturity.</strong> When you take responsibility for something you said or did, you indicate that you are developing essential qualities that you will need in adulthood.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“Humility and patience can help us to apologize and then listen to what the other person has to say.”—Rachel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>Apologizing allows you to make amends.</strong> People who say “I’m sorry” show that they are more concerned about making peace than about proving themselves right and proving the other person wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“Even if you don’t think you are at fault, making peace should be the priority. It doesn’t cost anything to say ‘I’m sorry,’ but it can restore a friendship.”—Miriam.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  <strong>Apologizing helps you feel better.</strong> Regret over hurting someone by word or action is a heavy load to carry. Once you apologize, though, that burden is lifted off your shoulders.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em>“There were times when I spoke rashly to my mom or dad. I felt bad, but I found it hard to apologize. When I did, though, I always felt better because it restored the peace in the family.”—Nia.</em></p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Does apologizing take effort? Yes! Dena, a young woman who has had to apologize more than once for being rude to her mom, admits: “It’s not easy to say ‘I’m sorry.’ It feels like there’s a lump in my throat and no words can come out!”</p>
<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>How to say “I’m sorry”</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  <strong>If possible, apologize in person.</strong> A face-to-face apology allows the other person to see the genuineness of your remorse. Text apologies, by comparison, may fall flat. Even when accompanied by a sad-faced emoji, they can seem impersonal and insincere.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> If you can’t apologize in person, consider calling on the phone or writing a card. Whichever method you choose, plan your words carefully.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><em>Bible principle: “The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering.”—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:28-20:15:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 15:28</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>  <strong>Apologize promptly.</strong> The longer an issue remains unresolved, the more serious the wrong will seem and the more awkward things will be between you and the person you hurt.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Set a goal—for example, ‘I will apologize <strong>today.’</strong> Determine what time limit is most practical; then keep your resolve.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><em>Bible principle: “Be quick to settle matters.”—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:25-40:5:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 5:25</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>  <strong>Apologize sincerely.</strong> Saying “I’m sorry <strong>that you feel that way”</strong> is <strong>not</strong> an apology! “The person who was wronged will usually respect you if he sees that you take full responsibility for what you did,” says a young woman named Janelle.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Make the apology <em>unconditional.</em> Don’t say, in effect, “I’ll apologize for my part of the problem if you’ll apologize for your part.”</p>
