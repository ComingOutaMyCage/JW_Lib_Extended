<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>At times, some worshippers of God wonder whether living by Bible standards is worth the time and effort it takes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:2-19:73:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 73:2, 3</a>) They might even begin experimenting with things that conflict with Jehovah’s laws and then try to deceive other worshippers by hiding their bad conduct.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>This article is designed to help those who may have gone down that road but want to stop their deceptive course.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>What is a double life?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Leading a double life means that when you are with your peers who don’t obey Jehovah, you do things that you know are wrong; but when you are with fellow worshippers, you act as though you want to serve Jehovah. It is as if you had two lives, and each involved wearing a mask.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>“When you lead a double life, you’re hiding something from both sides, so no one knows the real you. Ultimately, a double life is a double betrayal.”—Erin.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> A double life can include engaging in <strong>private</strong> conduct that you know Jehovah disapproves of.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“When I was 14, I started looking at immoral images on the Internet. When in front of others, I acted as if I hated pornography, but in my heart I knew that I didn’t.”—Nolan.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:24</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Does leading a double life make me a bad person?</strong></h2>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Not necessarily. Of course, some people have decided that they don’t want to live by Bible standards. But is that really true of you? Or is there an underlying factor, such as:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  You feel awkward when you stand out as different from your peers.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  You feel that you have more in common with your schoolmates than with those in your congregation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  You feel that you just don’t have the strength and ability to follow all of God’s commandments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“I think that some young ones who lead a double life feel more comfortable with people who don’t share their Christian values because they have a need to fit in, anywhere.”—David.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Of course, none of these factors <strong>justifies</strong> leading a double life. Still, it helps <strong>explain</strong> how even good people can get ensnared. If that has happened to you, what can you do?</p>

<ol class="source"><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet"><strong>1.</strong> </span><strong>Examine your life as it stands right now.</strong> Ask yourself: ‘Is this really the person I want to be?
