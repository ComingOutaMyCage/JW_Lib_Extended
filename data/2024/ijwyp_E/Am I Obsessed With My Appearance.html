<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>The Bible tells us not to think more of ourselves “than it is necessary to think.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:3</a>) So it’s proper​—even necessary​—to think about yourself to a degree. That’s why, for example, you brush your teeth and give attention to your hygiene.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>What, though, if you frequently get discouraged over your body image​—perhaps to the point of being obsessed about it? If that’s the case, you might wonder . . .</p>
<h2 id="p36" data-pid="36"><strong>‘Why do I have a negative body image?’</strong></h2>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>There could be several reasons. These include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>Influence of the media.</strong> “Young people are bombarded with images that make us feel that we have to be superskinny and gorgeous at all times. As a result, if we’re anything less than perfect, we feel disgusting!”​—Kellie.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>Influence of parents.</strong> “I’ve noticed that if a mother is obsessed with her body image, often the daughter views herself the same way. It can be the same with fathers and sons.”​—Rita.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>Low self-esteem.</strong> “People who are obsessed with their body image constantly demand positive reinforcement from others about how they look. It gets tiring to be around that!”​—Jeanne.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>Regardless of the cause, you might be asking . . .</p>
<h2 id="p42" data-pid="42"><strong>‘Should I change the way I look?’</strong></h2>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span>Consider what some of your peers say.</p>
<blockquote><div id="f3" class="west_right quarter">

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span>“You can’t always change the things you don’t like about yourself, so it’s best to accept your flaws. If you do, other people are less likely to notice them.”​—Rori.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"></span>“Do what you can to be healthy. If you’re healthy, you’ll look the way you’re supposed to look. And if someone can’t appreciate you for who you are (rather than what you look like), that person isn’t your friend.”​—Olivia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Do what you can to look your best. But don’t worry about the rest. Being overly concerned about how you look can be dangerous. (See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502013269/56">Julia’s Story</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span>On the other hand, a balanced attitude will help you view yourself realistically, as a young woman named Erin learned. “Sure, I have insecurities,” she says, “but I notice that I feel bad only when I focus on the wrong things. Now I just exercise regularly and eat right. The rest falls into place naturally.”</p>
<h2 id="p48" data-pid="48"><strong>The best makeover ever!</strong></h2>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="38"></span>When you have a balanced view of your body image, you will feel (and even look) your best. The Bible can help. It encourages you to cultivate the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="39"></span><strong>Contentment.</strong> “It’s better to enjoy what we have than to want something else, because that makes no more sense than chasing the wind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:6:9-21:6:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="40"></span><strong>A balanced approach to exercise.</strong> “Bodily training is beneficial for a little.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"></span><strong>Inner beauty.</strong> “Man sees what appears to the eyes; but as for Jehovah, he sees what the heart is.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><blockquote><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc">When I was 16, I had major issues with my weight. I’ve never been overweight, but I’m not naturally skinny either. I was curvy. I thought that just maybe, if I were slender, guys would like me. So I almost starved myself in order to achieve the body I wanted.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">I got skinny, but I ended up with health problems as a result. These were addressed, but the emotional effects are still there. To this day, I have issues with food. I’ve slowly come to terms with my body. I eat right and exercise. But when I’m upset with myself about something, my automatic reaction is to punish myself by not eating.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">If I could, I would tell other young people to remember that everyone has a different perspective. No matter what you look like, there will always be some people who think you’re attractive and others who don’t. The important thing is that you’re healthy. <em>That’s</em> what matters to those who truly care about you.</p>
