<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Preparing for baptism doesn’t involve memorizing facts, as a person might do to pass a school exam. However, you <strong>will</strong> need to use your “power of reason” to strengthen your conviction that what the Bible teaches is the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:1</a>) For example:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Are you convinced that God exists and that he deserves your worship?</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>.</p>
