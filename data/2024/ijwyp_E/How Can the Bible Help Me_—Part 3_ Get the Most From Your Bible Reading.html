<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>When you look inside the Bible, you will notice a lot of text. Don’t be overwhelmed by that! Instead, think of the Bible as a fully stocked buffet table. You can’t eat everything you see. But you <em>can</em> select enough for a satisfying meal.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>To benefit fully from a Bible “meal,” you need to concentrate on what you read. This article will help you do that.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">In this article</p>
<ul class="noMarker noIndent"><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:500600120/9"><strong>Why concentrate on what you read in the Bible?</strong></a></p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Why concentrate on what you read in the Bible?</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The more you put into your Bible reading, the more you will get out of it. Think of this comparison: You can dip a tea bag in hot water briefly and get <strong>some</strong> flavor. But you will get more if you let it steep for a while.</p>

</div>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>It’s similar with Bible reading. Instead of dipping in and out quickly, let your mind and heart dwell on the material. That is what the writer of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> did. Regarding God’s law, he said: “I ponder over it all day long.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Of course, that doesn’t mean that you literally need to devote an entire day to reading and thinking about the Bible. Here’s the point: The psalmist took time to think about God’s Word. Doing so helped him to make good decisions.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:98-19:119:100" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:98-100</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“My mother once told me, ‘You have seven days in a week, and during that week you do many things for yourself. Why not give some time to Jehovah? It’s only fair!’”—Melanie.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>When you think about Bible principles, you’ll be better able to make good decisions—for example, when you are choosing friends or when you are confronted with temptation to do something wrong.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  <strong>Ask questions.</strong> For example: ‘What does this account tell me about Jehovah?

<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>Also ask yourself, ‘How does what I have read relate to the theme of the Bible?’ That question is especially important. Why? Because everything in the Bible—from Genesis to Revelation—relates in some way to a central theme: How Jehovah will sanctify his name by means of his heavenly Kingdom and prove that he has the right to rule and that his way of ruling is best.</p>
