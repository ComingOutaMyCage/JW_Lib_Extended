<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>What is sexting?</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“Sexting” is the practice of sending sexually explicit texts, photos, or videos via cell phone. “It’s almost the normal order of operation now,” says one man. “You text back and forth and pretty soon you’re exchanging hot photos.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Why do people do it? The way some teenagers see it, “having a naked picture of your significant other on your cellphone is an advertisement that you’re sexually active,” says a senior deputy prosecuting attorney quoted in <em>The New York Times.</em> “It’s an electronic hickey.” One teenager even calls it a form of “safe sex.” After all, she says, “you can’t get pregnant from it and you can’t transmit S.T.D.’s.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Other reasons teenagers sext include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  To flirt with someone they hope to be in a relationship with.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Because someone has already sent them an explicit photo and they feel pressured to ‘return the favor.’</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Once you send a photo via cell phone, you no longer own it, nor can you control how it might be used​—or how it will affect your reputation. “Mistakes and transgressions have never been so easily transmitted and archived for others to see,” says Amanda Lenhart, senior research specialist and author of a Pew Research Center report on sexting.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>In some cases</p>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong> </strong> Nude photos have been mass-forwarded by the recipient to entertain his friends.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong> </strong> Jilted boyfriends have distributed nude photos as a way to get revenge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong> In many cases, sexting nude photos has been considered the same as child abuse or distributing child pornography. Some minors who have sexted have even been prosecuted as sex offenders.</p>
<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>What does the Bible say?</strong></h2>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>The Bible speaks favorably of sexual pleasure <em>within marriage.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:​18</a>) However, it takes a clear stand on sexual conduct between unmarried persons. Consider the following Bible verses:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  “Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness not even be mentioned among you, . . . neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:​3, 4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  “Deaden . . . your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Those verses warn not only against “fornication” (sexual relations outside of marriage) but also against such things as “uncleanness” (a broad term that refers to any type of moral impurity) and “sexual appetite” (referring not to normal romantic feelings that can be satisfied in marriage but to a passion that likely will lead to improper conduct).</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>Ask yourself:</em></p>
<ul><li><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  How is sexting nude photos a form of “uncleanness”?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  In what way does it fuel improper “sexual appetite”?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  Why is the desire to view or spread nude photos “hurtful”?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>The following Bible passages point to an even more compelling reason to shun sexting.</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>  “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:​15</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong> </strong> “What sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:​11</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>Those verses describe the positive results of being morally upright. When you have praiseworthy conduct, you do not need to be fearful of impulsive acts coming back to haunt you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><em>Ask yourself:</em></p>
<ul><li><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong> </strong> What sort of person am I?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong> </strong> Do I care about the reputation of others?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong> </strong> Do I want to be entertained by something that hurts others?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><strong> </strong> How might sexting affect my reputation?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><strong> </strong> How might sexting damage the trust my parents have in me?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>TRUE STORY</strong> “I have a friend who kept her relationship with a boy a secret. Then she sent a nude photo of herself to him, and he sent one of himself to her. Not even 48 hours later, her dad decided to check her phone. He discovered the texts, and he was devastated. He confronted her, and she admitted to everything. I know she’s sorry for the way she acted, but her parents were truly in shock and were so upset! They’re not even sure if they can trust her anymore.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>Fact of life:</strong> Sexting degrades both the sender and the viewer. “It makes me feel so disgusted and disappointed with myself,” says one teenager whose boyfriend pressured her into sexting him.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span>In view of the moral, ethical, and possible legal consequences of sexting, you would do well to follow the Bible’s advice:</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>  “Flee from the desires incidental to youth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:22</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span>  “Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:37-19:119:37" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 119:37</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p43" data-pid="43"><strong>What would <em>you</em> do?</strong></h2>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span>Apply the Bible’s advice in a real-life situation. Read Janet’s statement, and then choose which option you think is best.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"></span><em>“One time I met a boy, and we exchanged numbers. Within a week he was asking me to send him pictures of me in a bikini.”​—Janet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"></span>What do you think Janet should have done? What would <em>you</em> do?</p>
<ul><li class="listSingleChoice"><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span><strong>OPTION A</strong> You could reason: ‘There’s nothing wrong with that. After all, if we went to the beach, he would see me in a bathing suit anyway.’</p>
</li>
<li class="listSingleChoice"><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="38"></span><strong>OPTION B</strong> You could reason: ‘I’m not sure what he’s up to. Let me send a photo that’s less revealing and see what happens after that.’</p>
</li>
<li class="listSingleChoice"><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="39"></span><strong>OPTION C</strong> You could reason: ‘This boy is out for only one thing. I’m going to delete his message.’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="40"></span>Option C seems best, doesn’t it? After all, the Bible says: “Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it, but an unthinking person will walk right into it and regret it later.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"></span>This exercise points to an issue that is often at the root of sexting as well as other forms of misconduct: <em>Are you selective in your choice of friends?</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>) “Associate with people you know will not tolerate inappropriate behavior,” says a young woman named Sarah. A young woman named Delia would agree. “Some so-called friends are trying, not to help you <em>keep</em> your morals, but to <em>break</em> them,” she says. “If their conduct is contrary to God’s laws, they are encouraging you to break your moral integrity. Do you really want that?”</p>
