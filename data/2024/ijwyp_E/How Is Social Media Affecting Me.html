<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Being on social media is like riding a spirited horse—control it, or <strong>it</strong> will control <strong>you.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“I’ll go on social media—supposedly for ‘just a few minutes’—then suddenly it’s hours later! Social media can be both addictive and a time waster.”—Joanna.</em></p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> Social media is addictive because it is made to be that way. The designers know that the more popular a site is and the more time people spend on it, the more money advertisers will pay.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Do I often lose track of time when scrolling through social media? Could some of that time be spent on more productive activities?’</p>

<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>How is social media affecting my sleep?</strong></h2>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Most experts say that teenagers need at least eight hours of sleep each night, but many are getting less. Use of social media may contribute to that problem.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“I check my phone before I go to bed, and then I end up wasting hours scrolling through posts. It’s a bad habit that I’m trying to break.”—Maria.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> Insufficient rest can contribute to anxiety and depression. According to psychology professor Jean Twenge, a lack of sleep is the ultimate dampener to mood. She adds that “over time,” sleep deprivation can lead to “serious mental health issues.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘How much sleep do I get each night?’ ‘Am I scrolling through social media when I should be winding down and getting ready for bed?’</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>What you can do.</strong> Keep electronic devices out of your bedroom at night. Whenever possible, stop using screens two hours before bedtime. If you need an alarm to wake you up in the morning, consider using one that <strong>isn’t</strong> on a phone or tablet.</p>

I need to start growing up, and that means being more responsible. I need to get to bed earlier so that I can function the next day at 100 percent.”—Jeremy.</em></p>

<h2 id="p25" data-pid="25"><strong>How is social media affecting my emotions?</strong></h2>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>In one study, nearly half of high-school girls who participated said that they have “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness.” Part of the blame may lie with social media. “The more time you spend on social media, comparing yourself to other people, the more likely you are to become depressed,” says Dr. Leonard Sax.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>“It’s common for young people to compare themselves with others, and social media can make that tendency even worse. You can look at people randomly for hours and compare your life with theirs, or you can look at the fun things your friends are doing and feel like you’re missing out.”—Phoebe.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> While social media can help you keep in touch with friends, it is no replacement for in-person conversations. “Electronic connection does <em>not</em> seem to satisfy our deep-seated need for true human contact,” writes Dr. Nicholas Kardaras. “It does not address the underlying need for real in-depth connection.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Do I feel lonely after looking at what my friends are doing?’ ‘Do I feel that my life is boring compared with the seemingly exciting life that my friends depict on social media?’ ‘Do I become discouraged when something I post receives few or no “likes”?’</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>What you can do.</strong> Try a “social media detox”—a break from social media that lasts a few days, a week, or even a month. Increase the amount of time you spend with friends face-to-face or on the phone. See if you begin to feel less stressed and happier during your break from social media.</p>
