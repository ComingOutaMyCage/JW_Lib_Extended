<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Do you know a young person who is dealing with a serious health problem? Do <em>you</em> have an illness or disability that prevents you from enjoying the activities that others your age take part in?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>If so, it’s only natural for you to be discouraged at times. The Bible, however, contains two very comforting thoughts.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Your Creator, Jehovah God, knows your situation. More than that, “he cares for you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Jehovah God’s purpose is to cure all sickness! You can read about that in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1-4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Countless young people who face challenging health problems have found that faith in God and in his promises sustains them. Consider four examples.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>At age five, I was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, a degenerative illness that greatly limits me. At times, I get discouraged because I can’t do the things that others my age can. But my parents and those in my congregation give me physical, emotional, and spiritual support. I serve as a full-time minister, and fellow Christians often accompany me as I conduct Bible studies with interested ones.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Jesus said that each day has its own anxieties. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>) So I try to take one day at a time and set realistic goals for myself that I can reach and achieve. I look forward to the day in God’s new world when I will be able to have “the real life,” free of this debilitating illness.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>I had an operation, but the surgeon was able to remove only about 40 percent of the tumor. And then—in just two months—the tumor was back to its original size! Since then, I’ve had many examinations, many treatments, and many disappointments.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>At times, the tumor causes pain like knife stabs all over, but mostly in my back and chest. Still, I try not to be consumed with my situation. I remind myself that others have endured terrible things too, and yet they’ve remained positive. My greatest help in maintaining a positive attitude is my confidence that one day Jehovah God will fulfill his promise to end all suffering.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>When I was 16, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a debilitating and progressive disease that has affected my ability not only to work but also to share in Christian activities to the extent that I would like. I repeatedly read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>, which says: “Throw all your anxiety upon [God], because he cares for you.” I draw strength from the thought that Jehovah cares for each of us individually.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>At age two, I was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer that began in the spinal cord and then traveled to the brain. Doctors managed to control the disease, but the treatments affected my growth. Today, I’m only 1.37 meters (4 ft 6 in.) tall. Many people think I’m lying when I tell them that I’m 18 years old!</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>In the Christian congregation, people treat me with dignity. They don’t play childish pranks on me, as did the kids with whom I went to school. I try to keep a positive attitude about my situation. Really, the best thing that could happen to a human being has happened to me—I’ve come to know Jehovah! Whatever I must endure, I am sure of Jehovah’s care every step of the way.
