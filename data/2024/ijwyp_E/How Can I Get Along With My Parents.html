<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>If you can’t seem to get along with your parents, you might think they should do something to improve the situation. As we will see, however, there are steps <em>you</em> can take to reduce the frequency and ease the intensity of the conflicts. First, consider . . .</p>
<h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>Why conflict happens</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>  Thinking ability.</strong> As you grow up, you begin to think more deeply about things than you did when you were a child. You also start forming strong convictions​—some of which might be at odds with those of your parents. Nevertheless, the Bible says: “Honor your father and your mother.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 20:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Fact of life:</strong> It takes maturity and skill to disagree without being disagreeable.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  <strong>Independence.</strong> As you mature, your parents will likely grant you greater freedom. The problem is, it might not be <em>as much</em> freedom as you want or <em>as soon</em> as you want it​—and that can lead to conflict. Nevertheless, the Bible says: “Be obedient to your parents.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Fact of life:</strong> Often, how much freedom your parents grant you depends on how you handle the freedom you already have.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p25" data-pid="25"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Focus on <em>your</em> role.</strong> Instead of putting the entire blame on your parents for a conflict, consider what <em>you</em> can do to make peace. “It’s not always what your parents say but how you respond that adds to a conflict,” says a young man named Jeffrey. “Speaking calmly goes a long way toward smoothing things over.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “As far as it depends on <em>you,</em> be peaceable.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:18-45:12:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 12:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>  <strong>Listen.</strong> “I find that this is the hardest thing to do,” admits 17-year-old Samantha. “But I’ve also found that when parents see that you’re listening, chances are they’ll listen to you.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Be quick to listen, slow to speak.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 1:19</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>  <strong>Think like a teammate.</strong> Approach a conflict as you would a sport, such as a tennis match. But put the issue​—not your parents​—on the other side of the net. “In a conflict, parents want what they think is best for their teenager and the teenager wants what he thinks is best for himself,” says a young man named Adam. “So, at least in theory, they’re working for the same goal.”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Pursue the things making for peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:19-45:14:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 14:19</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>  <strong>Be understanding.</strong> “I find it helpful to remember that parents have to struggle with their own issues, which are often just as menacing as ours,” says a teenager named Sarah. A young woman named Carla takes it further. “I try to put myself in my parents’ position,” she says. “What would it be like for me if I were raising a child and dealing with the same situation? What would be in the best interests of my child?”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 2:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>  <strong>Be obedient.</strong> In the end, that’s what the Bible requires you to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Colossians 3:​20</a>) And things will go much easier for you if you comply. “My life is less stressful when I just do what my parents ask,” says a young woman named Karen. “They have already sacrificed a lot for me, so it’s the least I can do.” Obedience is one of the greatest antidotes for conflict!</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Where there is no wood, the fire goes out.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:20-20:26:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:20</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><strong>Tip.</strong> If you find it difficult to communicate, try writing out your thoughts in a note or a text message. “I do that when I’m not in a good enough frame of mind to talk,” says a teenager named Alyssa. “It helps me to express myself without yelling or saying something I’ll regret later on.”</p>
