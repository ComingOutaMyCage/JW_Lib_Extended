</li>
</ul>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>The following information will help you to improve in that area.</p>
<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>What does it mean to be responsible?</strong></h2>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Responsible people fulfill their obligations at home, at school, and in the community. They recognize that they are accountable for their actions. So when they make a mistake, they admit it, apologize, and strive to make amends.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Each one will carry his own load.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p25" data-pid="25"><strong>Why should I want to be responsible?</strong></h2>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span> A responsible person uses his or her talents wisely and is more likely to be held in high esteem, treated like an adult, and granted freedoms and privileges.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Have you beheld a man skillful in his work? Before kings is where he will station himself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:29-20:22:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span> A responsible person is usually generous and is more likely to enjoy satisfying friendships.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Practice giving, and people will give to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:38-42:6:38" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 6:​38</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span> A responsible person feels a sense of accomplishment and proper pride, which builds his or her self-confidence.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Let each one prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 6:4</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p32" data-pid="32"><strong>How can I be more responsible?</strong></h2>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>To help answer that question, look at the following statements. Which ones best describe how <em>you</em> feel?</p>
<blockquote><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>“It’s frustrating to be treated like a baby who can’t be away for an hour without checking in with Mommy and Daddy!”​—Kerri.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>“My parents usually allow me to go out with my friends without any hassle.”​—Richard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>“When I look at other kids my age and see what they can do, I think: ‘Wow! Why don’t my parents let <em>me</em> do that?’”​—Anne.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>“My parents basically let me do what I want. I’m thankful to them for granting me the freedom that I have.”​—Marina.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Some young people are granted more freedom than others. What can make the difference?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>Fact of life:</strong> The level of freedom you are granted is often determined by the amount of trust you have earned.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span>For example, consider what two of the young people quoted earlier have to say.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>Richard:</strong> “At one time my parents were skeptical of my ability to handle freedom. But they trust me now because I have used my freedom responsibly. I don’t lie to my parents about where I’m going or whom I’m going with. In fact, I usually tell my parents what I’m up to without their having to ask me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span><strong>Marina:</strong> “I lied to my parents two times in my whole life, and I got caught both times. From that point on, I have been honest with my parents. For example, I always give them details about what I’m doing, and then I check in with them when I’m out. Now they have a lot more trust in me.”</p>
