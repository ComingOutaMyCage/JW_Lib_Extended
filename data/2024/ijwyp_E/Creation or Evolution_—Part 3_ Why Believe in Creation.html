<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Objections to belief</strong></h2>
<h3 id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>1. If you believe in creation, people will think you’re against science.</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“My teacher said that believing in creation is something people do when they’re too lazy to come up with an explanation for how the world works.”​—Maria.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> Those who make such claims are not aware of the facts. Famous scientists such as Galileo and Isaac Newton believed in a Creator. Their belief did not conflict with their love for science. Likewise, some scientists today find no conflict between science and belief in creation.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Try this:</strong> Type the expression (including quotation marks) “explains her faith” or “explains his faith” in the search box of <a href="http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/"><em>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</em></a> for examples of those in the field of medicine and science who accept creation. Note what helped them to reach that conclusion.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Belief in creation doesn’t make you antiscience. In fact, learning more about the natural world can strengthen your belief in creation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 1:​20</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>2. If you believe in the Bible’s account of creation, people will think you’re a religious fanatic.</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“A lot of people consider belief in creation to be a joke. They feel that the Genesis account is just a story.”​—Jasmine.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> People often have misconceptions about the Bible’s account of creation. For example, some creationists claim that the earth was recently created or that life was created in six 24-hour days. The Bible does not support either viewpoint.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a> simply states: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” This does not conflict with scientific evidence that the earth is billions of years old.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  The word “day” as used in Genesis can refer to long periods of time. In fact, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4</a>, the word “day” is used to describe <em>all six</em> days of creation.</p>

<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>Think about your beliefs</strong></h2>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Belief in creation does not require “blind faith.” Rather, it rests on sound reasoning. Consider this:</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Everything you experience in life teaches you that where there is design, there is a designer. When you see a camera, a plane, or a house, you rightly conclude that someone designed it. Why should you abandon that logic when you consider the human eye, a bird in the sky, or our planet Earth?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Engineers often copy traits that they observe in nature so that they can improve their own inventions, and they rightly want others to acknowledge their work. Is it logical to recognize the human inventor and his work and yet fail to acknowledge the Creator and His far superior designs?</p>
