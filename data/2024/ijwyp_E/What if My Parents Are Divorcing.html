<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>1. Taking the blame</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“My mom once told me that all the problems between her and my dad started when I was born, so I assumed that I was the reason my parents’ marriage failed.”—Diana.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Keep this in mind:</strong> The divorce is not about you. It’s about issues between your parents. You did not cause their problems and you cannot solve them. <strong>They</strong> are responsible for taking care of their marital difficulties.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>2. Harboring resentment</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“I am very angry with my dad for being unfaithful to my mom. It would take a lot for him to regain my trust.”—Rianna.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Keep this in mind:</strong> You are probably angry and frustrated because of what is happening between your parents, and you have good reason to be. But holding on to resentment is not healthy. It can hurt <strong>you</strong> physically and emotionally. That’s why it has been said that harboring resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to get sick.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

</div>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>3. Doubting <em>your</em> potential for a happy marriage</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“I’m so afraid that I’ll do what my father did. I’m afraid that if I get married and have kids, I’ll put myself in the very situation that led to my parents’ divorce.”—Jessica.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Keep this in mind:</strong> Just because your parents’ marriage has failed, it doesn’t mean that your marriage will fail. In fact, you can learn valuable lessons from your parents’ experience. For instance, you may become more aware of the traits to look out for in a prospective marriage mate. Your parents’ failed marriage can also motivate you to develop qualities that will make you a better husband or wife.</p>

<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>Three things you can do</strong></h2>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>1. Communicate.</strong> People who bottle up negative feelings may be prone to self-destructive practices, like abusing alcohol or drugs. Instead of going that route, try the following:</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>Talk to your parents.</em> If one or both parents are trying to involve you in <strong>their</strong> issues, calmly but firmly explain to them how this is affecting you. If you find it hard to talk to them in person, you could write a letter to one or both of them.</p>

</div>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>Talk to a trusted friend.</em> Just having someone who will hear you out can be a tremendous relief. The Bible says that “a true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>Talk to your Creator.</em> You always have a listening ear with the “Hearer of prayer,” Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>) The Bible says that you can “throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span>While parental divorce can cause you a lot of anxiety, it can also teach you to appreciate your strengths. It may even enable you to acquire new ones. “My parents’ divorce forced me to be more responsible,” says Jeremy, whose parents divorced when he was 13. “I was the older child, so I had to help my mom more and also be a support to my little brother.”</p>
