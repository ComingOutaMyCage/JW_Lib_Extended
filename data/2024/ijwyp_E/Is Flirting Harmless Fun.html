<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>What is flirting?</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Some people think of flirting as conveying the impression through words or actions that you are romantically interested in a person of the opposite sex. Is it wrong to show that you are romantically interested in someone? Not necessarily. “If you’re in a position to date and you’re interested in someone,” says a young woman named Ann, “how else can you find out if the feeling is mutual?”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In this article, however, we will discuss the kind of flirting that involves acting as if you have a romantic interest in someone when you have no serious intent.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“It’s one thing to pay special attention to someone because you want to start a romantic relationship. It’s a different matter to lead someone on and then pull the rug out from under him because you were never really serious.”​—Deanna.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Why do some people do it?</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Some people flirt just to boost their ego. “When you realize you can attract that kind of attention, you may want more of it,” says a young woman named Hailey.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>But if you intentionally give the impression that you have romantic interest in someone when in fact you do not, you show a callous disregard for the other person’s feelings. You also call into question your judgment. The Bible says: “Foolishness is a joy to one lacking good sense.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:21-20:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>For good reason, Hailey concludes, “Flirting may begin harmlessly, but it often ends dangerously.”</p>
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>What are the dangers?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Flirting hurts your reputation.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>“A person who flirts comes across as insecure and immature. You feel that she is not being honest with you but is only trying to get something out of you.”​—Jeremy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The Bible says: “Love . . . does not look for its own interests.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:​4, 5</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>  Flirting hurts the person you flirt with.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“If I meet someone who is flirty, it makes me not want to be around him. It’s as if the only reason he’s talking to me is because I’m a girl. People who flirt don’t really care about me; they only care about making themselves feel better.”​—Jaqueline.</em></p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>The Bible says: “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>To think about: Have you ever been led to believe that someone had a romantic interest in you, only to find out that you were wrong? If so, how did you feel afterward? How can you avoid hurting someone else in that way?</p>

<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>  Flirting hurts your prospects for genuine romance.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“A flirt would be a totally undesirable person to marry or even to date. How could I really get to know or trust someone if he is just putting on an act?”​—Olivia.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>In the Bible, the psalmist David states: “I avoid those who hide what they are.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:4-19:26:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>To think about: What kind of person does a flirt appeal to? Is that the kind of person <em>you</em> want to attract?</p>
