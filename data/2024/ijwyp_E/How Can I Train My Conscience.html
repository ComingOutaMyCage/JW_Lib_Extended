<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>What is the conscience?</strong></h2>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Your conscience is your inner sense of right and wrong. It is “like a law written in the human heart,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:15-45:2:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 2:15</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version</em>) A good conscience helps you evaluate a course you are about to take or one you have already taken.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>Your conscience is like a compass.</strong> It guides you in the right direction so that you can avoid trouble.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <strong>Your conscience is like a mirror.</strong> It reflects your moral condition, revealing the kind of person you are inside.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>  Your conscience is like a good friend.</strong> It can give you good advice and help you succeed—if you listen to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>Your conscience is like a judge.</strong> It convicts you when you do something bad.</p>
</li>

</figure>
</div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Your conscience is a vital tool that can help you (1) make wise decisions and (2) make amends for your mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>Why train your conscience?</strong></h2>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>The Bible tells us to “maintain a good conscience.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:16-60:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:16</a>) That’s difficult to do if your conscience hasn’t been trained.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em>“I would lie to my parents about my whereabouts and keep it a secret. At first, my conscience bothered me, but over time what I was doing didn’t seem like a big deal.”—Jennifer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Eventually, Jennifer’s conscience moved her to tell her parents what was going on and to stop deceiving them.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> At what <strong>earlier</strong> point could Jennifer’s conscience have prodded her?</p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>“It’s difficult and stressful to lead a double life. Once your conscience allows you to make one bad decision, it becomes easier to make another bad decision.”—Matthew.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Some people ignore their conscience altogether. They are “past all moral sense,” says the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:19-49:4:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:19</a>) The <em>Good News Translation</em> renders it: “They have lost all feeling of shame.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Are people who have no feelings of guilt for wrong actions really better off? What problems will they inevitably run into?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> To hold a good conscience, you need to have your “powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p29" data-pid="29"><strong>How can you train your conscience?</strong></h2>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>To train your conscience, you need a standard against which to compare your actions. Some people follow standards set by:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>  family and culture</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>  peers</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>  popular entertainers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>However, the standard for living found in the Bible is superior. That isn’t surprising, since the Bible is “inspired of God,” the One who created us and knows what is best for us.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>Consider some examples.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><strong>THE STANDARD:</strong> “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>  How can that standard affect your conscience when you are tempted to cheat on a test, lie to your parents, or steal?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span>  If your conscience moves you to be honest in all things, how do you think that can benefit you now and in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>THE STANDARD:</strong> “Flee from sexual immorality.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong> </strong> How can that standard affect your conscience when you are tempted to look at pornography or to have premarital sex?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>  If your conscience moves you to flee from sexual immorality, how will that benefit you now and in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span><strong>THE STANDARD:</strong> “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span><strong> </strong> How can that standard influence you when a conflict arises with a sibling or a friend?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p44" data-pid="44"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"></span>  If your conscience moves you to be merciful and compassionate, how will that benefit you now and in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"></span><strong>THE STANDARD:</strong> “Jehovah . . . hates anyone who loves violence.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p46" data-pid="46"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span><strong> </strong> How should that standard influence your choice of movies, TV shows, and video games?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p47" data-pid="47"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="38"></span>  If your conscience moves you to reject violent entertainment, how will that benefit you now and in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="39"></span><strong>TRUE STORY:</strong> “I have friends who played violent video games, and I did too. Then my dad told me that I couldn’t play those games anymore. So I would just play them when I was visiting my friends. When I came home, I would be quiet about it. My dad would ask me what was wrong, and I would say that I was fine. One day, though, I read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a> and began to feel bad about what I was doing. I realized that I had to stop playing those video games. This time, I did. Seeing my example, one of my friends was also moved to stop playing violent games.”—Jeremy.</p>
