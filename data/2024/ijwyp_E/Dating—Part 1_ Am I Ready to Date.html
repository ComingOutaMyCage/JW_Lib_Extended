<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What is dating?</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Some people view dating as merely a social activity. In this article, however, “dating” refers to the period of time a couple spend together to see if they would be suitable marriage mates for each other. So, dating has an objective. It isn’t just a way to enjoy attention from the opposite sex.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In time, dating should lead to a decision—either to marry or to end the romantic relationship. When you start dating, you need to be ready for either outcome.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> If you believe that you’re ready to date, you should also believe that you’re ready for marriage.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Are you ready to date?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Dating could lead to marriage, so you would do well to consider what qualities you will bring to the relationship. For example, consider the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Family relationships.</strong> How you treat your parents and siblings—especially when you’re under stress—often indicates how you will treat a spouse.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech, as well as everything injurious.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Would my parents and siblings say that I treat them with respect? When I have a disagreement with one of them, am I able to discuss things calmly, or do I lose my temper and argue?’</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>  Self-sacrifice.</strong> When you are married, you will need to consider and often yield to your spouse’s preferences.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Do I always need to get my way? Do others view me as reasonable? In what ways have I shown that I put the needs of others ahead of my own?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>Humility.</strong> A good marriage mate can admit his or her mistakes and sincerely apologize for them.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “We all make mistakes many times.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Do I readily admit my mistakes, or do I make excuses for them? Am I overly sensitive when people give me constructive criticism?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  <strong>Finances.</strong> A person who can handle money responsibly will avoid one of the most common sources of conflict in marriage.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:28-42:14:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 14:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Can I control my spending, or am I frequently in debt? How have I shown that I can handle money responsibly?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Spiritual health.</strong> If you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should have an established routine of studying the Bible and attending Christian meetings.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> ‘Do I take the initiative to maintain my spiritual health? Is my spiritual routine a priority, or do I let other things interfere with it?’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> The person you marry deserves nothing less than a capable mate. If you are working hard at being that kind of person, you will be more likely to attract someone who is doing the same.</p>
