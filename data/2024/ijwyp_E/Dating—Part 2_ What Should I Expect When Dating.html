<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Expect to have honest conversations</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>You and your friend will learn a lot about each other as you spend time together. Some things you will learn by observing the other person’s behavior.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>However, there are some things that the two of you will need to discuss openly. As you do so, remain as objective as possible and resist the tendency to let your emotions cloud your judgment.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Topics that both of you should discuss include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Finances.</strong> Do you have any debt? Do you find it difficult to control your spending? If you get married, how would you and your spouse make decisions on income and expenses?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Health.</strong> Are you in good health? Have you had any serious health problems in the past?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Goals.</strong> What would you like to accomplish with your life? Are your goals compatible with the goals of your girlfriend or boyfriend? After you are married, will you still be happy if circumstances keep you from achieving your goals?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>Family.</strong> Do you currently have any family obligations? What obligations do you foresee in the future? Do you want to have children? If so, how many?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Be discerning about <em>when</em> to discuss marriage. If you bring up the topic too soon, you could make your friend feel as if he or she is being rushed. Remember, each person is different, and each relationship moves at its own pace.</p>

In that case, the girl might end up hurt and confused because she expects a commitment sooner rather than later. It’s important for both to be on the same page.”—Ariana, married one year.</em></p>

<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>Expect to have different viewpoints</strong></h2>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>No two people are alike. So don’t assume that you and the person you are dating will agree on everything or feel the same way about things. Factors such as your culture and upbringing can affect your viewpoint.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Rather than focus on how much you agree on things, pay close attention to what happens when you <em>disagree.</em> You’ll learn a lot about the other person that way.</p>

<h2 id="p27" data-pid="27"><strong>Expect dating to be stressful</strong></h2>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>Dating will no doubt take up a lot of your time and may cause you some stress. What can help?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>Set reasonable limits. Don’t become <em>so</em> consumed with your dating life that you neglect your responsibilities—or your other friends. Alana, married five years, says: “You’ll still need your friends after you get married, and they will still need you. Don’t ignore them now, just because you have started dating.”</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>Remember, when you get married, you will need to balance <em>all</em> facets of your life. Why not work on achieving that balance while dating?</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>Remember, dating is a temporary period that will lead to a decision, either to marry or to end the romantic relationship. Part 3 of this series will discuss things you need to consider when making that decision.</p>
