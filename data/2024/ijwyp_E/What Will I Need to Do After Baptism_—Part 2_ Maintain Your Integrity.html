<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible says that “Jehovah will not hold back anything good from those walking in integrity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:11-19:84:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 84:11</a>) What does “walking in integrity” mean? It means living in a way that shows you are keeping the promise you made to Jehovah when you dedicated yourself to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5</a>) How can you walk in integrity after your baptism?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>What it means:</strong> Realistically, all Christians will face challenges in life. Some of the problems you will face, such as ridicule or opposition, directly result from being a Christian. Others, like money problems or sickness, can affect all of mankind.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>What to expect:</strong> Now and then, your circumstances in life will change, and sometimes in ways you don’t like. The Bible says that bad things can happen to anyone—Christians and non-Christians alike.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Since you know that you will have challenges, you can prepare to face them. View challenges as an opportunity to strengthen your faith and to rely more heavily on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 1:2, 3</a>) In time, you will be able to say from experience, as did the apostle Paul: “For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>.</p>
<div class="blockTxt"><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>TRUE STORY.</strong> <em>“Soon after I got baptized, my brothers abandoned our Christian beliefs, my parents got sick, and then I got sick too. It would have been easy for me to give up—to forget that when I dedicated myself to God, I promised to make his worship the most important thing in my life. Yet, my dedication is precisely what helped me deal with those challenges.”—Karen.</em></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Get to know Joseph.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Key scripture:</strong> “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">James 1:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>What it means:</strong> At times, all of us are tempted by desires that if not controlled can lead us to do what is wrong.</p>

</div>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>What to expect:</strong> After baptism, you will still experience “the desires of the flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:18-61:2:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:18</a>) You may even feel tempted to have sex before you are married.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Make up your mind now—<strong>before</strong> you are tempted—so that you will not let your desires make your decisions for you. Remember, Jesus stated: “No one can slave for two masters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 6:24</a>) You can choose who your master will be. Let it be Jehovah. No matter how strong a wrong desire might be, you can choose not to act on it.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:16-48:5:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Galatians 5:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><strong>What to expect:</strong> You were likely excited and full of zeal after you got baptized. You were full of love for Jehovah.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Continue to do the right thing, even if for a time your heart doesn’t seem to be in it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:27-46:9:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>) Meanwhile, draw closer to your heavenly Father by getting to know him better and by talking to him in prayer often.
