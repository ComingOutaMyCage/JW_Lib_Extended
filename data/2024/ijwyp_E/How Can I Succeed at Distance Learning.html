<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <strong>Plan your routine.</strong> Try to maintain a regular schedule, just as you would if you were at school. Set aside specific times for schoolwork, chores, and other important matters. You can adjust your schedule as needed.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Cultivate self-discipline.</strong> Part of growing up is realizing that sometimes you have to tackle the work at hand—even when you aren’t motivated. Don’t procrastinate!</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Be industrious, do not loiter at your business.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 12:11</a>, footnote.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>“The biggest challenge is self-discipline. It’s easy to make excuses and say, ‘I’ll do my schoolwork later.’ Then you don’t do it later, and you end up getting behind.”—Alexandra.</em></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> How can doing your schoolwork in the same place and at the same time each day increase your self-discipline?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>  Create a study space.</strong> Have on hand all the materials you need. Make your learning environment comfortable, but not cozy. You’re there to work, not to snooze! If you can’t have a dedicated area for your schoolwork, maybe the kitchen or a bedroom could be set aside as your study space during your school period.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>  Learn to focus.</strong> Concentrate on the subject at hand, and don’t multitask. If you try to do several things at once, you’re more likely to make mistakes and take longer to complete your work.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  <strong>Take breaks.</strong> Go for a walk, ride your bike, or exercise.
