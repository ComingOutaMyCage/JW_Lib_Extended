<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>What is puberty?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Simply put, puberty is a stage of life that puts you on a physical and emotional fast-track to adulthood. During this stage, your body goes through rapid physical and hormonal changes that prepare you for reproduction and childbirth.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>No, that doesn’t mean you’re ready to be a parent. But puberty is a sign that you are leaving your childhood behind​—a fact that may bring you feelings of both anticipation and sadness.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Quiz:</strong> Which of the following ages would you say are normal for puberty to begin?</p>
<ul class="noMarker"><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14">8</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15">9</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Answer:</strong> <em>All</em> those ages are considered to be within the normal range for the onset of puberty.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>That means there’s no need to be overly concerned if you’re nearing your mid-teens and you haven’t yet started the process​—or if you’re under ten and you <em>have</em> started. Puberty has its own biological timetable that is largely out of your control.</p>

<h2 id="p25" data-pid="25"><strong>Physical changes</strong></h2>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Perhaps the most obvious change that comes with puberty is a growth spurt. The problem is, not all your body parts grow at the same rate. So don’t be surprised if you’re a bit clumsy in your movements. Be assured that in time, things will balance out.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>A number of other physical changes come with puberty.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Puberty in boys:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  Growth of the sex organs</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  Underarm, pubic, and facial hair growth</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  Involuntary erections and nocturnal emissions</p>

</ul>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Puberty in girls:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  Breast development</p>

</ul>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Puberty in both genders:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>  Body odor, caused by a combination of sweat and bacteria.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> You can control body odor by washing frequently and by using a deodorant or an antiperspirant.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>  Acne, caused by bacteria trapped in oil glands.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Although acne is not easy to control, washing your face often and using skin cleansers can help.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p42" data-pid="42"><strong>Emotional changes</strong></h2>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>The hormonal surge that causes the physical changes of puberty can take a toll on your emotions. You might even experience powerful mood swings.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p44" data-pid="44"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><em>“One day you’re crying, and the next day you’re fine. One minute you’re angry, and the next minute you’re holed up in your room depressed.”​—Oksana.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>While going through puberty, many young people also feel extremely self-conscious, as if they were being watched and judged by everyone. And the fact that your appearance is changing so dramatically doesn’t help!</p>
<blockquote><p id="p46" data-pid="46"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><em>“When I started growing, I would purposely slouch and wear big shirts. Even though I knew why my body was changing, I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed. It felt unnatural.”​—Janice.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span>Perhaps the biggest emotional change you will experience is acquiring a whole new outlook on the opposite sex.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p48" data-pid="48"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><em>“I stopped thinking that all boys were annoying. Now some were actually attractive, and the idea of falling in love wasn’t such a bad thing after all. In fact, ‘who likes whom’ became a popular topic of conversation.”​—Alexis.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span>While going through puberty, some young people find themselves attracted to members of the same sex. If this happens to you, do <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012508/">not conclude that you are gay</a>. In many cases, such feelings subside with time.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p50" data-pid="50"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span><em>“Because of my obsessively comparing myself with other boys, I started feeling attracted to them. It wasn’t until later in my youth that I developed an attraction to females. Homosexual feelings are now just a part of my past.”​—Alan.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="p51" data-pid="51"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p52" data-pid="52"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span><strong> </strong> Try to adopt a positive view. Really, puberty is a physical and emotional makeover that you need. You can even draw confidence from the words of the psalmist David, who said: “In an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 139:14</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p53" data-pid="53"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span>  Avoid comparisons, and resist the urge to focus on your <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502013268&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502013268&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">body image</a>. The Bible says: “Man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p54" data-pid="54"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"></span>  Get sufficient <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502019478/">exercise</a> and rest. Enough <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502019477/">sleep</a> will help you be less irritable, stressed, and depressed while you’re awake.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p55" data-pid="55"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"></span>  Challenge your ‘inner critic.’ Is everyone <em>really</em> watching you that closely? Even if people make remarks about your growth, put things in perspective. The Bible says: “Do not take to heart every word that people say.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:21-21:7:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:​21</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p56" data-pid="56"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span>  Learn how to <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502019479/">control your sexual urges</a> so that you do not act on them. The Bible says: “Flee from sexual immorality! . . . Whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p57" data-pid="57"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="38"></span>  Talk to one of your parents or a trusted adult. True, it might be awkward at first. But the help you can get will make your effort worthwhile.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="39"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Puberty presents its challenges. It also affords you a wonderful opportunity to grow​—not just physically but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:26-9:2:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Samuel 2:26</a>.</p>
