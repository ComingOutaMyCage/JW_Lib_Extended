<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>What are the dangers?</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:1-20:22:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:1</a>, the Bible says that “a good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth.” So it’s OK to want a good reputation—even to want others to like you.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>But sometimes a desire for acceptance turns into a craving for popularity. Could there be a danger? Onya, 16, would say yes:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“I’ve seen people do crazy things—like jump off a second-story ledge at my school—just to become popular.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>To get the attention of their peers, some people even film their foolish stunts and post them online. For example, a number of teenagers uploaded videos of themselves eating laundry detergent pods—small capsules that contain toxic substances—something that no one should ever do!</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Don’t do anything from . . . a cheap desire to boast.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Efforts to become popular do not always involve going to risky extremes. Erica, 22, notes how some people use another strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“People will post highlight after highlight of their life, making it appear as if they had an endless list of close friends that they constantly spend time with. It creates an illusion of popularity.”</em></p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Cara, 15, says some people use deceit to create that illusion:</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Matthew, 22, admits to having done something like that:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>“I posted a picture and tagged the location as Mount Everest, even though I’ve never been to Asia!”</em></p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>Many people believe that the key to online popularity is to have an extraordinary number of followers and likes. Matthew, quoted earlier, admits that he used to feel that way:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><em>“I would ask people, ‘How many followers do you have?’ or ‘What’s the highest numbers of likes you’ve ever received?’ To raise my follower count, I would follow random people, hoping that they would follow me in return.
