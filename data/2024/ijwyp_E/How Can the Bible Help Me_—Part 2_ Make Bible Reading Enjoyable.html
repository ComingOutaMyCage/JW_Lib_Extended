<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Make the Scriptures live</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Get involved in what you read. You could use this approach:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>               <strong>Select a Bible account</strong> that you would like to study. You could pick a Bible event or a passage from a Gospel, or you could choose an account from the collection of dramatic Bible readings available on jw.org.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>               <strong>Read the account.</strong> You could read it by yourself, or you could read it aloud with friends or family members. One person could read the narration while others take on character parts.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>                 <strong>Try one or more of the following suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Draw pictures to illustrate the account. Or draw a storyboard​—a series of simple pictures that illustrate a sequence of events. Use captions to describe what is happening in each scene.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Draw diagrams. For example, as you read about a faithful character, connect that person’s qualities and actions with the blessings he or she received.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  Turn the account into a news story. Report the event from several perspectives, and include “interviews” with the main characters and eyewitnesses.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  If one of the characters in the account made an unwise decision, imagine a different ending. For example, consider Peter’s denial of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:66-41:14:72" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 14:66-​72</a>) How could Peter have responded better to the pressure?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  If you are feeling especially creative, take on the challenge of writing your own drama based on a Bible account. Include lessons that can be learned from the account.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>Investigate!</strong></h2>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>If you analyze details, you can uncover hidden gems in an account. In fact, sometimes just a word or two in a Bible account is significant.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>For example, compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:7-40:28:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 28:7</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:7-41:16:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 16:7</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em> </em> Why did Mark include the detail that Jesus would soon appear to the disciples <em>“and Peter”?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Clue:</strong> Mark was not an eyewitness of these events; evidently, he got his information from Peter.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>The hidden gem:</strong> Why must Peter have felt reassured to hear that Jesus wanted to see him again? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:66-41:14:72" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 14:66-​72</a>) How did Jesus prove himself a real friend to Peter? How can you imitate Jesus and be a real friend to others?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>When you make the Scriptures live and investigate the details, Bible reading becomes much more enjoyable!</p>
