<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Strict teachers. Peer pressure. Nerve-racking exams, and an avalanche of homework. If you say you don’t like school, it’s understandable.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> A teenager named Rachel<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> says:</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>If you feel similarly to Rachel, your school years might seem like a prison sentence that you just have to endure until you’re released at graduation. Is there a better way to look at your time spent at school?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> When you cultivate a better view of school, you take control of the situation and you stop seeing your schooling as a test of endurance. In a sense, school becomes a tool that you use to sharpen the skills you’ll need as an adult.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>To develop a better view of school, try to focus on the following:</p>
