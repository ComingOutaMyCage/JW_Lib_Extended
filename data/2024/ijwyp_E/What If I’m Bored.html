<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>To some people, there’s nothing worse than being stuck at home on a rainy afternoon with nothing to do and nowhere to go. “At times like that,” says a young man named Robert, “I just sit there, not knowing what to do with myself.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Surfing the Internet can be a way to pass the time, but it can also stifle your imagination and thus <em>contribute</em> to boredom. “You find yourself mindlessly staring at a screen and not really engaging your mind,” says Jeremy, aged 21.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>A young woman named Elena would agree. “There’s only so much you can do with technology,” she says. “It distracts you from the real world, so that when you put your device down, you’re bored with life even more!”</p>

<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Attitude makes a difference.</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Will simply having a lot to do stave off boredom? Much depends on your level of interest in what you are doing. For example, a young woman named Karen recalls: “School was very boring to me, even though I had things to do all day. You have to be engaged in what you’re doing in order not to be bored.”</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Broaden your horizons.</strong> Meet new friends. Start a new hobby. Research new subjects. People with a variety of interests are less likely to find it boring to be alone​—and less likely to <em>be</em> boring when with others!</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Bible principle: “Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:​10</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Focus on your objective.</strong> If you see a purpose in what you are doing, your interest in it will increase. Even schoolwork can be less boring when you see your objective.</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Accept what you cannot change.</strong> Even the most exciting pursuits will have at least some monotonous aspects. And even the best of friends will sometimes cancel plans, leaving you with nothing to do. Rather than becoming a victim to your circumstances and surrendering to negative feelings, try to adopt a positive attitude.</p>
