<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>  Cigarettes are deadly.</strong> Nicotine—the main agent in tobacco—is a toxic substance that is highly addictive. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “tobacco use is a major preventable cause of premature death and disease worldwide.”</p>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“I work in the medical field as a sonographer, and I have seen ultrasound images showing the impact that smoking has on patients. The amount of plaque buildup in the arteries of former smokers is astounding. I respect my body too much to try smoking.”—Theresa.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> Cigarettes contain some 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic. Each year, millions of people die from tobacco-related illnesses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>  Vaping exposes the user to toxic chemicals.</strong> Vaping, or using vape pens or electronic cigarettes, has been linked to lung injury and death. Also, like cigarettes, many vape products contain nicotine. Because it is highly addictive, nicotine can “prime young brains for addiction to other drugs,” says a fact sheet on e-cigarettes.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“Vape products with names such as cotton candy and cherry bomb have sweet flavors, which especially appeal to children and teenagers. The taste makes them ignore the risk.”—Miranda.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Did you know?</strong> The vapor from e-cigarettes is <em>not</em> just water. It contains particles of harmful substances—often including heavy metals—which are transferred to your lungs.</p>
