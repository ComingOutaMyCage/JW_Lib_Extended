<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span><strong>Understand pornography for what it is.</strong> Pornography is nothing less than an attempt to degrade something that God created to be honorable. Understanding pornography in this light will help you to “hate what is bad.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Consider the consequences.</strong> Pornography devalues those depicted in it. It also debases the person who views it. For good reason, the Bible says: “Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Make a commitment.</strong> “I have made a solemn promise never to look with lust at a girl,” said the faithful man Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:1-18:31:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 31:1</a>, <em>Today’s English Version</em>) The following are some ‘solemn promises’ you could make:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>I will not use the Internet when I am alone.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>I will immediately exit from any pop-up or site that is explicit.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>I will talk to a mature friend if I have a relapse.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Pray about it.</strong> The psalmist implored Jehovah God: “Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:37-19:119:37" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 119:37</a>) God wants you to succeed, and if you <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:102008409/">pray</a> to him he can give you the strength to do what is right!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Talk to someone.</strong> Choosing a confidant is often an important step in breaking the habit.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Remember this: <em>Each time you avoid pornography, you have won a significant victory.</em> Tell Jehovah God about that victory, and thank him for the strength he has given you. By avoiding pornography, you make his heart rejoice!—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>
