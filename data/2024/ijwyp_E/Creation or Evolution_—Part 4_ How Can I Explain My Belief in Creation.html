</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3">You believe in creation, but you’re reluctant to say so openly at school. Maybe your textbooks endorse evolution and you worry that teachers and classmates might make fun of you. How can you speak up confidently and explain your belief in creation?</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>You can do it!</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span><strong>You might think:</strong> ‘I’m not smart enough to discuss science and debate evolution.’ That’s how Danielle felt at one time. “I hated feeling that I had to contradict my teacher and my classmates,” she says. Diana agrees, “I got confused when they argued using scientific terms.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>However,</strong> your goal is not to win arguments. And the good news is that you don’t need to be a genius at science to explain why <em>you</em> find creation to be a rational explanation for the natural world.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the simple logic found in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:4</a>: “Every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>A young woman named Carol reasons on the principle of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:4</a> this way: “Imagine that you’re walking through a dense forest. Every evidence of a human being is miles away. You then look down and see a toothpick on the ground. What is your conclusion? Most people would say, ‘Someone else has been here.’ If something as small and insignificant as a toothpick is evidence of intelligent life, how much more so is the universe and all that’s in it!”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>If someone says:</strong> “If creation is true, then who created the Creator?”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>You could respond:</strong> “Just because we don’t understand everything about the Creator doesn’t mean he doesn’t exist. For example, you may not know the history of the person who designed your cell phone, but you still believe it was designed by <em>somebody,</em> right? [Allow for response.] There’s so much we can know about the Creator. If you’re curious, I’d be happy to share what I’ve learned about him.”</p>
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>Be ready</strong></h2>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The Bible says that you should be “ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:​15</a>) Therefore, give attention to two factors​—<em>what you say</em> and <em>how you say it.</em></p>
<ol><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>               <strong>What you say.</strong> Your love of God is important and can motivate you to speak up. But just telling others how much you love God may not be enough to convince them that God created all things. It might be best to use examples from nature to show why it is rational to believe in creation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>               <strong>How you say it.</strong> Be confident, but don’t be rude or condescending. People are likely to consider your viewpoint if you speak respectfully about their beliefs and acknowledge their right to come to their own conclusions.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>“I think it’s important never to come across as insulting or as a know-it-all. It would be counterproductive to speak in a condescending tone.”​—Elaine.</em></p>

Jenna states, “I feel much more comfortable discussing creation when I have a simple yet well-thought-out example to back up my belief.”</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Where can you find such examples? Many young people have had success using the following material:</p>
