<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What is a virginity pledge?</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>A virginity pledge is a written or oral promise to maintain sexual abstinence until marriage.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Virginity pledges became popular in the 1990’s when the Southern Baptist Convention in the United States launched “True Love Waits”​—a program that combined Biblical values with positive peer pressure to encourage young people to say no to sex before marriage.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>A similar program, started soon afterward, featured events where attendees who took the pledge were given a silver ring to symbolize (and remind them of) their no-sex-before-marriage commitment.</p>
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Do virginity pledges work?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The answer depends on whom you ask.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  According to researchers Christine C. Kim and Robert Rector, “several studies have found that adolescent virginity pledging was associated with delayed or reduced levels of teen sexual activity.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  According to research published by the Guttmacher Institute, studies indicate that “teens who take ‘virginity pledges’ are just as likely to have sex as those who do not.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Why the conflicting results?</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Some studies compare pledgers with non-pledgers <em>who do not share similar beliefs</em> about sex.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  Other studies compare pledgers with non-pledgers <em>who share similar beliefs</em> about sex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>What did the latter type of study reveal? Dr. Janet Rosenbaum, a specialist in adolescent health issues, says that after five years, “pledgers and non-pledgers don’t differ at all in their sexual behavior.”</p>
<h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>A better approach</strong></h2>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Virginity pledge programs have a noble goal. The problem is, they don’t necessarily instill the values needed for follow-through. Many who promise to remain virgins “aren’t really internalizing the pledge,” says Dr. Rosenbaum. “Abstinence has to come from an individual conviction rather than participating in a program.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>The Bible encourages such individual conviction, not by having a person take a written or oral pledge, but by helping him to “have [his] powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:​14</a>) After all, virginity is not just a matter of avoiding disease and pregnancy; it is a way to show honor to the Creator of marriage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:19-40:5:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:​19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:4-40:19:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:​4-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>The standards set forth in the Bible are for our good. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>) Indeed, all people​—regardless of their age​—can develop the strength of character to obey God’s command to “flee from sexual immorality.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:​18</a>) When they do marry, they will thus be able to enjoy intimacy fully, without the worries and regrets that are so often the aftermath of premarital sex.</p>
