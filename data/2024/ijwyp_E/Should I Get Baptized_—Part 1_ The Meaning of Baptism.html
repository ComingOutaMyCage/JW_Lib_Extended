<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Each year, many young people who are being raised as Jehovah’s Witnesses get baptized. Are you thinking of taking that step? If so, first you’ll need to understand the meaning of dedication and baptism.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>What is baptism?</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The baptism referred to in the Bible is complete immersion in water—not just a sprinkling of water—and it has rich symbolic meaning.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Going underneath the water during baptism shows publicly that you will no longer live to do just what pleases <strong>you.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Being raised out of the water shows that you have started a new life focused on doing what pleases <strong>God.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>By getting baptized, you publicly acknowledge that Jehovah has the authority to set the standard of right and wrong, and you officially make known your promise to conform voluntarily to what he wants you to do.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Why should you want publicly to commit to a life of obedience to Jehovah? See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:19-62:4:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 4:19 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>What is dedication?</strong></h2>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Before you get baptized, you should privately dedicate yourself to Jehovah. How?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>In a personal prayer, you tell Jehovah that you promise to serve him forever and that you will do what he wants no matter what situation arises and no matter what others choose to do.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Baptism is a public expression of that private dedication. It tells others that you have given up ownership of yourself and that you now belong to Jehovah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 16:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Why does your life get better when you belong to Jehovah? See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>Why is baptism important?</strong></h2>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Jesus established baptism as a requirement for his disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) Therefore, baptism is still a requirement for Christians. In fact, the Bible says it’s necessary for salvation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>However, your motive for getting baptized should be your love and appreciation for Jehovah. Your attitude should be like that of the psalmist, who wrote: “With what will I repay Jehovah for all the good he has done for me? . . . I will call on the name of Jehovah. I will pay my vows to Jehovah.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:12-19:116:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 116:12-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> What good has Jehovah done for you, and how can you repay him? See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:12-5:10:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:12, 13 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Romans 12:1</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><strong>MYTH — Only adults have the maturity needed to get baptized.</strong></p>
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><strong>FACT —</strong> Maturity is determined, not primarily by age, but by a person’s love for Jehovah and readiness to obey him. While still young, Joseph, Samuel, and Josiah showed such maturity. Many young ones today are doing the same.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “A child is known by his actions, whether his behavior is pure and right.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:11-20:20:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:11</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><strong>MYTH — If your friends are getting baptized, you should get baptized too.</strong></p>
<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p35" data-pid="35"><strong>FACT —</strong> The decision to make a dedication and to get baptized is a personal one that should come from a willing heart. It is not a rite of passage or a coming-of-age custom that you should take part in just because others have done so or because you think others expect it of you.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “[God’s] people will offer themselves willingly.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p37" data-pid="37"><strong>MYTH — If you are not baptized, you are not accountable for your actions.</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><strong>FACT —</strong> You become accountable to Jehovah, not when you get baptized, but when you know what is right and what is wrong in his eyes.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “If someone knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:17-59:4:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 4:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><strong>TIP:</strong> If the responsibility of being a dedicated, baptized Christian seems overwhelming, why not take steps to confront and address your fears? You can do so by reading <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008143/">Chapter 37</a> of the book <em>Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work,</em> Volume 2.</p>
