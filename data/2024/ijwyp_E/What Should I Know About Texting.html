<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Whom you text</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Many teenagers consider texting to be an indispensable way to communicate. Texting allows you to keep in touch with anyone and everyone on your contact list​—that is, unless your parents object.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><em>“My dad doesn’t like it when my sister and I talk to boys. If we do, it has to be on the landline phone, in the living room, and with others present.”​—Lenore.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> If you give out your number to just anyone, you can get into trouble.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>“If you aren’t careful about who knows your number, you’re bound to receive messages or pictures you don’t want.”​—Scott.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“If you regularly text a member of the opposite sex, you can get emotionally attached to that person very quickly.”​—Steven.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>) By taking a few precautions, you can spare yourself a lot of grief.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>True story:</strong> <em>“A boy and I were friends, and we texted a lot. I reasoned that we were just really close. I didn’t think that was a problem until he told me that he had developed romantic feelings for me. Looking back, I realize that I shouldn’t have hung out with him​—and texted him​—as much as I did.”​—Melinda.</em></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Consider:</strong> How, do you think, would Melinda’s friendship with the boy be affected by his revelation?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Rewrite the script!</strong> What could Melinda have done differently so that she and the boy could have remained just friends and nothing more?</p>
<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>What you text</strong></h2>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Text messages are so easy to send​—and fun to receive​—that it’s easy to forget that people may read between the lines.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> Words conveyed via texting can be misinterpreted.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><em>“With texting you can’t sense emotions and tone of voice​—even with emoticons or text symbols. It can cause misunderstandings.”​—Briana.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em>“I know girls who have ruined their reputations and are known to be flirts because of what they have sent in a text to boys.”​—Laura.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “Good people think before they answer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:28-20:15:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:​28</a>, <em>Good News Translation</em>) The lesson? Reread your message before you hit “Send”!</p>
<h2 id="p28" data-pid="28"><strong>When you text</strong></h2>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>By using common sense, you can develop your own rules of texting​—texting etiquette, as some call it.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> If you don’t watch your texting manners, you’ll come off as rude and repel friends rather than attract them.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>“It’s easy to forget texting etiquette. I find myself in a conversation with someone or at the dinner table, and yet I’m texting at the same time.”​—Allison.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><em>“It’s dangerous to be texting and driving. If you take your eyes off the road, you risk getting into an accident.”​—Anne.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>The Bible says:</strong> “For everything there is an appointed time, . . . a time to keep quiet and a time to speak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7</a>) That applies to texting just as much as it does to talking!</p>
<h2 id="p34" data-pid="34"><strong>Texting tips</strong></h2>
<h3 id="p35" data-pid="35"><strong>Whom you text</strong></h3>
<ul class="source"><li><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Obey your parents’ guidelines.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:20</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Be selective about whom you give your number to. When you politely refuse to share private information​—including your cell-phone number​—you develop a skill that you’ll need as an adult.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Don’t become overly familiar by sending flirtatious text messages. If romantic feelings grow, you’re only inviting frustration and heartache.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><em>“I’ve built up a good record with my parents regarding the use of my cell phone, so they trust me to make wise decisions about whose number I will put in my contact list.”​—Briana.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="p40" data-pid="40"><strong>What you text</strong></h3>
<ul class="source"><li><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Before you start to type your message, ask yourself, ‘Is texting the right way to communicate in this situation?’ It might be better to make a phone call or wait to speak in person.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Don’t text anything you wouldn’t say in person. “If it shouldn’t be said out loud, it shouldn’t be sent by text,” says 23-year-old Sarah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><em>“If someone sends you provocative pictures, tell your parents. It will serve as a protection and will also build your parents’ trust in you.”​—Sirvan.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="p44" data-pid="44"><strong>When you text</strong></h3>
<ul class="source"><li><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Decide in advance when your phone will be off-limits. “I don’t have my cell phone with me at the dinner table or while studying,” says a girl named Olivia. “I turn it off during Christian meetings so that I’m not tempted to look at it.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><span class="txtSrcBullet">;-) </span>Be considerate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philippians 2:4</a>) Don’t text while you’re trying to carry on a face-to-face conversation with someone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><em>“I’ve set rules for myself, such as not texting people when I’m in a group of friends unless it’s necessary. I also don’t give out my number to people I’m not already close to.”​—Janelly.</em></p>
