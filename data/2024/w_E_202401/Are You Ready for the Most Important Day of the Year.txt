SONG 19 The Lord’s Evening Meal

Are You Ready for the Most Important Day of the Year?


“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—LUKE 22:19.


FOCUS
Consider why the Memorial is so special, how we can prepare for it, and how we can help others to attend.


 1. Why is the Memorial the most important day of the year? (Luke 22:19, 20)

Your answer


FOR Jehovah’s people, the Memorial of Christ’s death is the most important day of the year. It is the only event that Jesus specifically commanded his followers to observe. (Read Luke 22:19, 20.) We look forward to the Memorial for a number of reasons. Let us consider some of them.
 2. What are some reasons why we look forward to the Memorial?

Your answer


2 The Memorial helps us to reflect on the value of the ransom. It reminds us of ways we can show appreciation for Jesus’ sacrifice. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) It also gives us an opportunity to enjoy “an interchange of encouragement” with our brothers and sisters. (Rom. 1:12) Each year, a number of inactive ones attend. Some are even moved to return to Jehovah because of the warm welcome they receive. And many interested people are motivated to start on the road to life by what they see and hear. No wonder the Memorial holds such a special place in our heart!
 3. How does the Memorial unite our global brotherhood? (See also picture.)

Your answer


3 Think, too, of how the Memorial unites our global brotherhood. Jehovah’s Witnesses gather as the sun sets progressively around the world. We all hear a talk that emphasizes the importance of the ransom. We sing two songs of praise, pass the emblems, and wholeheartedly say “amen” to four prayers. Within about 24 hours, all congregations will have followed the same pattern. Can you imagine the joy that Jehovah and Jesus must feel when they see us unitedly honoring them in this way?

 4. What will we discuss in this article?

Your answer


4 In this article, we will discuss these questions: How can we prepare our heart for the Memorial? How can we help others to benefit from it? And how can we assist those who are inactive? The answers to these questions will help us to be ready for this sacred occasion.
HOW CAN WE PREPARE OUR HEART FOR THE MEMORIAL?
 5. (a) Why should we reflect on the value of the ransom? (Psalm 49:7, 8) (b) What did you learn from the video Why Did Jesus Die?

Your answers


5 One of the most important ways we can prepare our heart for the Memorial is by reflecting on the value of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. On our own, we could never redeem ourselves from sin and death. (Read Psalm 49:7, 8; see also the video Why Did Jesus Die?)a So at great cost to himself and to his dear Son, Jehovah arranged for Jesus to give his life in our behalf. (Rom. 6:23) The more we meditate on what Jehovah and Jesus sacrificed for us, the more we will appreciate the ransom. We will consider just a few of the things that the ransom cost Jehovah and Jesus. But first, what did the ransom involve?
 6. What did the ransom involve?

Your answer


6 A ransom is a price that is paid to buy something back. The first man, Adam, was perfect when he was created. When he sinned, he forfeited the prospect of everlasting life not only for himself but also for all his children. In order to buy back what Adam lost, Jesus offered his own perfect life as a sacrifice. During his entire life on earth, Jesus “committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.” (1 Pet. 2:22) At the time of his death, Jesus’ perfect life corresponded exactly to the life Adam lost.​—1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Tim. 2:6.
 7. What are some tests that Jesus faced while on earth?

Your answer


7 Jesus remained perfectly obedient to his heavenly Father despite the many tests he faced while on earth. As a child, Jesus had to submit to the authority of his imperfect human parents even though he was born perfect. (Luke 2:51) As a teenager, he needed to resist any pressure he may have faced to be disobedient or unfaithful. And as an adult, Jesus had to stand up to temptations from Satan the Devil, including direct attacks on his loyalty to God. (Matt. 4:1-11) Satan was determined to make Jesus sin so that he would not be able to pay the ransom.
 8. What further tests did Jesus endure?

Your answer


8 During his earthly ministry, Jesus endured further tests. He faced persecution and threats to his life. (Luke 4:28, 29; 13:31) He had to deal with the imperfections of his followers. (Mark 9:33, 34) When he was on trial for his life, he was tortured and ridiculed. Then he was executed in an extremely painful and humiliating way. (Heb. 12:1-3) He had to endure the final part of his trial on his own, without Jehovah’s protection.b​—Matt. 27:46.
 9. How do we feel about Jesus’ sacrifice? (1 Peter 1:8)

Your answer


9 Clearly, the ransom cost Jesus a great deal. Do we not feel deep love for Jesus when we reflect on how he willingly sacrificed so much in our behalf?​—Read 1 Peter 1:8.
10. What did the ransom cost Jehovah?

Your answer


10 What about Jehovah? What did he willingly sacrifice so that Jesus could pay the ransom? Jehovah and Jesus have the closest bond that can exist between a father and a son. (Prov. 8:30) Just think, then, how Jehovah was affected as he observed Jesus enduring so many trials while on earth. No doubt it greatly pained Jehovah to see his Son mistreated, rejected, and tested.
11. Use an example to show how Jehovah must have felt when Jesus was executed.

Your answer


11 Any parent who has lost a child in death knows all too well the intense feelings of grief that such a loss brings. We have strong faith in the resurrection, but that does not erase the pain we feel when a loved one dies. This example helps us to understand how Jehovah must have felt when he watched his beloved Son suffer and die on that spring day in 33 C.E.c​—Matt. 3:17.
12. What can we do during the time leading up to the Memorial?

Your answer


12 Between now and the Memorial, why not do a personal study project or a Family Worship project that focuses on the ransom? Use the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses (if available in your language) or other Bible study aids to explore the topic in depth.d Also, be sure to follow the Memorial Bible reading schedule provided in Our Christian Life and Ministry​—Meeting Workbook. And on the day of the Memorial, do not forget to watch the special Morning Worship program. When we prepare our own heart for the Memorial, we will be in a good position to help others benefit from it too.​—Ezra 7:10.
Ideas for Research
When researching the subject of the ransom, you might look for information that answers such questions as these:
  Why was the ransom necessary? Why did Jehovah not simply forgive Adam and Eve?

  Why was Jesus the ideal person to come to earth and become our Redeemer?

  What blessings does the ransom make possible now?

  How will the ransom benefit us in the future?




HELP OTHERS TO BENEFIT
13. What is a first step in helping others to benefit from the Memorial?

Your answer


13 How can we help others to benefit from the Memorial? A first step, of course, is to invite them. In addition to contacting those we meet in our regular ministry, we can make a list of people to invite. These could include our relatives, workmates, schoolmates, and others. Even if we do not have enough printed copies of the invitation, we can share a link to the electronic version. Who knows how many will respond!​—Eccl. 11:6.
14. Illustrate the power of a personal invitation.

Your answer


14 Never underestimate the power of a personal invitation. One day, a sister who lived in a religiously divided household was surprised when her husband proudly told her that he was planning to join her for the Memorial. Why was she surprised? Because many times in the past, she had encouraged him to attend, but he never did. What made the difference this time? “I got a personal invitation,” he said, explaining that a local elder with whom he was acquainted had invited him. The husband attended that year and for many years thereafter.
15. What do we want to keep in mind when inviting people to the Memorial?

Your answer


15 Keep in mind that those we invite may have questions​—especially if they have never attended one of our meetings. We do well to anticipate their questions and prepare to answer them. (Col. 4:6) For example, some may wonder: ‘What will happen at the event?’ ‘How long will it last?’ ‘Is there a dress code?’ ‘Is there an admittance fee?’ ‘Will collections be taken?’ When inviting someone to the Memorial, we could simply ask, “Do you have any questions?” and then address any concerns the person may have. We can also use the videos Remember Jesus’ Death and What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? to help the individual understand how our meetings are conducted. And lesson 28 of the Enjoy Life Forever! book gives us a number of fine points we can share.
16. What further questions may those who attend the Memorial have?

Your answer


16 After they attend the Memorial, newly interested ones may have further questions. They may wonder why only a few (if any) partook of the emblems. They may also wonder how often we observe the Memorial. And they might want to know if all meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses are held in the same way. Even though many of these points are discussed during the Memorial talk, newcomers may need a more detailed explanation. The article on jw.org entitled “Why Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Observe the Lord’s Supper Differently From the Way Other Religions Do?” can help us answer some of their questions. We want to do whatever we can​—before, during, and after the Memorial—​to help those “rightly disposed” to benefit from this observance.​—Acts 13:48.
ASSIST INACTIVE ONES
17. How can elders assist those who are inactive? (Ezekiel 34:12, 16)

Your answer


17 During the Memorial season, how can elders assist those who are inactive? Give them loving attention. (Read Ezekiel 34:12, 16.) Before the Memorial, be sure to call on as many as possible. Assure them of your affection and your desire to help in any way you can. Invite them to attend the Memorial. If they do attend, welcome them warmly. After the Memorial, keep in touch with these dear brothers and sisters, and provide whatever spiritual assistance they need to return to Jehovah.​—1 Pet. 2:25.
18. How can all of us help inactive ones? (Romans 12:10)

Your answer


18 All in the congregation can help inactive ones who attend the Memorial. How? By treating them with love, kindness, and respect. (Read Romans 12:10.) Remember that these dear sheep may have hesitated to return to a meeting. Perhaps they were afraid they would not be well-received.e So avoid putting them on the spot by asking embarrassing questions or by making comments that could be hurtful. (1 Thess. 5:11) These brothers and sisters are our fellow believers. We are happy to worship with them once again!​—Ps. 119:176; Acts 20:35.





How Did the Congregation React?
“I was embarrassed to return to the Kingdom Hall. I wondered how the friends would treat me. One of our elderly sisters who was there 30 years ago said to me, ‘Welcome home, Son!’ That really touched my heart. I was truly home.”​—JAVIER.
“I went to the Kingdom Hall and sat in the last row so that no one would notice me. However, many began to recognize me from the days when I had attended as a child. They welcomed me and embraced me so affectionately that I felt an overwhelming peace. It was as if I had come home.”​—MARCO.


19. What benefits come from remembering Jesus’ death?

Your answer


19 Is it any wonder that Jesus arranged for us to observe the Memorial of his death each year? When we do, we benefit ourselves and others in many ways. (Isa. 48:17, 18) We grow in our love for Jehovah and Jesus. We show how much we appreciate what they have done for us. We strengthen our bonds with our fellow believers. And we may help others learn how they too can enjoy the blessings that the ransom makes possible. Let us do all we can, then, to be ready for this year’s Memorial​—the most important day of the year!
When the Memorial falls on a Sunday, as it does in 2024, no weekend congregation meeting will be scheduled. For this reason, no study article has been provided for next week.
