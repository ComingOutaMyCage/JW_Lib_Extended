What type of vehicle was the Ethiopian eunuch riding in when Philip approached him?

THE original-language word rendered “chariot” in the New World Translation can refer to any one of several vehicles. (Acts 8:28, 29, 38) However, it seems that the Ethiopian was riding in a vehicle larger than a simple military or racing chariot. Consider some reasons for this conclusion.
The Ethiopian was a high official who had traveled a great distance. He was “a man who had authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and who was in charge of all her treasure.” (Acts 8:27) Ancient Ethiopia included modern-day Sudan and the southernmost part of modern-day Egypt. Although the man probably did not ride in the same vehicle for the entire trip, he must have had luggage for the long journey. Among the vehicles used in the first century C.E. to transport passengers were four-wheel covered carriages. “Such a carriage would allow for more luggage, make travel more comfortable, and perhaps increase the distance one could travel,” states the book Acts​—An Exegetical Commentary.
The Ethiopian was reading when Philip approached him. The account states that “Philip ran alongside and heard [the eunuch] reading aloud Isaiah the prophet.” (Acts 8:30) Traveling carriages were not built for fast travel. This slower rate of travel would have not only allowed the eunuch to read but also enabled Philip to catch up to the carriage on foot.
The Ethiopian “urged Philip to get on and sit down with him.” (Acts 8:31) In a typical racing chariot, the riders would stand. In a traveling carriage, however, there would have been room for the eunuch and Philip to sit down.
In harmony with the inspired record in Acts chapter 8 and the available historical evidence, our publications have recently depicted the Ethiopian eunuch as riding in a vehicle larger than a simple military or racing chariot.
