<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>EVERYONE feels afraid at times. Of course, our study of the Bible has freed us from fear of the dead, fear of the supernatural, and fear of the future. But we still live in a time that is marked by “fearful sights,” such as war, crime, and disease. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) We may also fear men, including governments that oppress us or even family members who oppose true worship. Some worry that they will not be able to endure either a current trial or one that they may face in the future.</p>

The king of Gath, Achish, soon learned that David was the mighty warrior who was celebrated in song as having struck down “tens of thousands” of Philistines. David “became very much afraid.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:10-9:21:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:10-12</a>) He worried about what Achish would do to him.

But <strong><em>how</em></strong> do we strengthen our trust in Jehovah, especially when we are afraid? Consider an illustration. If you learn that you have an illness, you may at first feel afraid. However, you can ease your fears if you trust your doctor. He may have an outstanding record of treating patients with that illness. He may listen attentively, convincing you that he really understands your feelings. And he may propose a treatment that has worked well for others. Similarly, we strengthen our trust in Jehovah by considering what he has already done, what he is doing now, and what he will yet do for us. That is what David did. As we consider some of his inspired words found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:0-19:56:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 56</a>, think about how you too can strengthen your trust in Jehovah and conquer your fears.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[69]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> A sister in North Macedonia named Tanja conquered her fears by meditating on future blessings. Her parents strongly opposed her study of the Bible. She relates: “Some of the things that I feared would happen did happen. My mother beat me after every meeting. My parents threatened to kill me if I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Finally, Tanja was thrown out of her home. How did she react? She says: “I focused on how happy I would be for all eternity for choosing to keep my integrity. I also thought about how Jehovah <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>would reward me in the new world for anything I might lose in this system and how all bad things would be forgotten.” Tanja did keep her integrity. And with Jehovah’s help, she found a place to live. Today, Tanja is married to a faithful brother and they serve happily together in the full-time ministry.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[71]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> During the great tribulation, people in general will become “faint out of fear.” But God’s people will remain steadfast and courageous. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:26-42:21:28" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 21:26-28</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Why will we not give in to fear? Because we will have already learned to trust in Jehovah. Tanja, quoted earlier, says that her past experiences are helping her to face other unsettling situations. “I have learned that there is no situation that Jehovah cannot work out for our good,” she observes. “Sometimes it may seem that others are controlling things, but the reality is that they have only as much control as Jehovah allows. And though a trial may be hard, it will end.”</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[73]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Fear is normal today. But like David, we can refuse to be trapped by fear. Our 2024 yeartext is David’s prayer to Jehovah: “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:3-19:56:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 56:3</a>) As one Bible reference work stated about this verse, David “neither feeds his fear nor stares at his problems but looks to his Redeemer who will deliver him.” Think about our yeartext in the coming months, especially when you are facing frightening situations. Take time to reflect on Jehovah’s actions in the past, present, and future. Then, like David, you can declare: “In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:4-19:56:4" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 56:4</a>.</p>
