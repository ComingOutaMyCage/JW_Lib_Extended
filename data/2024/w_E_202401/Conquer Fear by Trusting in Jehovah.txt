SONG 38 He Will Make You Strong

Conquer Fear by Trusting in Jehovah


OUR YEARTEXT FOR 2024: “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”​—PS. 56:3.


FOCUS
Learn how we can strengthen our trust in Jehovah and overcome our fears.


 1. Why might we feel afraid at times?

Your answer


EVERYONE feels afraid at times. Of course, our study of the Bible has freed us from fear of the dead, fear of the supernatural, and fear of the future. But we still live in a time that is marked by “fearful sights,” such as war, crime, and disease. (Luke 21:11) We may also fear men, including governments that oppress us or even family members who oppose true worship. Some worry that they will not be able to endure either a current trial or one that they may face in the future.
 2. Describe David’s situation while he was in Gath.

Your answer


2 David experienced fear. For instance, when King Saul was trying to hunt him down, David decided to flee to the Philistine city of Gath. The king of Gath, Achish, soon learned that David was the mighty warrior who was celebrated in song as having struck down “tens of thousands” of Philistines. David “became very much afraid.” (1 Sam. 21:10-12) He worried about what Achish would do to him. How did David conquer his fears?
 3. According to Psalm 56:1-3, 11, how did David conquer his fears?

Your answer


3 In Psalm 56, David expresses his feelings while he was in Gath. That psalm lays bare David’s fears, but it also reveals how he conquered those fears. When he felt afraid, David trusted in Jehovah. (Read Psalm 56:1-3, 11.) His trust was not misplaced. With Jehovah’s blessing, David devised an unusual but effective strategy: He pretended to be crazy! Achish now viewed David more as an irritant than a threat, so David was able to escape.​—1 Sam. 21:13–22:1.
 4. How can we strengthen our trust in Jehovah? Illustrate.

Your answer


4 We too can conquer fear by trusting in Jehovah. But how do we strengthen our trust in Jehovah, especially when we are afraid? Consider an illustration. If you learn that you have an illness, you may at first feel afraid. However, you can ease your fears if you trust your doctor. He may have an outstanding record of treating patients with that illness. He may listen attentively, convincing you that he really understands your feelings. And he may propose a treatment that has worked well for others. Similarly, we strengthen our trust in Jehovah by considering what he has already done, what he is doing now, and what he will yet do for us. That is what David did. As we consider some of his inspired words found in Psalm 56, think about how you too can strengthen your trust in Jehovah and conquer your fears.
WHAT HAS JEHOVAH ALREADY DONE?
 5. To conquer his fears, on what did David reflect? (Psalm 56:12, 13)

Your answer


5 While David’s life was still at risk, he focused his attention on what Jehovah had already done. (Read Psalm 56:12, 13.) That was David’s pattern of thinking throughout his life. For example, at times he meditated on Jehovah’s creative works, which reminded him of Jehovah’s almighty power and keen interest in humankind. (Ps. 65:6-9) David also meditated on what Jehovah had done for others. (Ps. 31:19; 37:25, 26) And he especially meditated on what Jehovah had already done for him personally. Jehovah had supported and protected David from infancy. (Ps. 22:9, 10) Imagine how such meditation must have bolstered David’s trust in Jehovah!




David strengthened his trust in Jehovah by focusing on what He had done, was doing, and would yet do (See paragraphs 5, 8, 12)d




 6. When we feel afraid, what will help us to trust in Jehovah?

Your answer


6 When you feel afraid, ask yourself, ‘What has Jehovah already done?’ Reflect on what he has created. For example, when we “observe intently” how Jehovah cares for the birds and the flowers​—which were not created in his image and are not capable of worshipping him—​we will build up our trust that he will care for us too. (Matt. 6:25-32) Consider also what Jehovah has done for his worshippers. You might study a Bible character who showed outstanding faith, or you might read the experience of a modern-day servant of Jehovah.a Additionally, meditate on how Jehovah has already cared for you. How did he draw you to the truth? (John 6:44) How has he answered your prayers? (1 John 5:14) How are you benefiting every day from the sacrifice of his beloved Son?​—Eph. 1:7; Heb. 4:14-16.




We strengthen our trust in Jehovah by focusing on what he has done, is doing, and will yet do (See paragraphs 6, 9-10, 13-14)e




 7. How did the experience of the prophet Daniel help Vanessa to conquer her fear?

Your answer


7 Vanessa,b a sister in Haiti, faced a frightening situation. A man in her community called her and sent her messages every day, pressuring her to have a relationship with him. Vanessa flatly refused. But the man became more aggressive and even threatened her. “I was scared,” she says. How did Vanessa conquer her fear? She took practical steps to protect herself. An elder helped her to contact the authorities. But she also focused on how Jehovah had protected his servants in the past. “The first person I thought of was the prophet Daniel,” Vanessa relates. “He was thrown into a den with hungry lions even though he was innocent. Yet, Jehovah cared for him. I asked Jehovah to take charge of the whole situation. After that, I wasn’t afraid anymore.”​—Dan. 6:12-22.
WHAT IS JEHOVAH DOING NOW?
 8. Of what was David convinced? (Psalm 56:8)

Your answer


8 Though David was in mortal danger when he was in Gath, he refused to give in to his fears. Instead, he chose to consider what Jehovah was doing for him at that time. David could sense that Jehovah was guiding and protecting him and that He understood his feelings. (Read Psalm 56:8.) David also had friends, such as Jonathan and High Priest Ahimelech, who gave him loyal support and practical help. (1 Sam. 20:41, 42; 21:6, 8, 9) And despite being a target of King Saul, David escaped with his life. He was convinced that Jehovah was keenly aware of his trial and of how that trial was affecting him emotionally.
 9. What does Jehovah observe about each one of us?

Your answer


9 When you face a trial that makes you afraid, remember that Jehovah takes note of the trial and of how that trial makes you feel. For example, Jehovah noticed not only the mistreatment of the Israelites in Egypt but also “the pains they [suffered].” (Ex. 3:7) David sang that Jehovah saw both his “affliction” and his “deep distress.” (Ps. 31:7) And when God’s people suffered​—even as a result of their own foolish decisions—​“it was distressing to him.” (Isa. 63:9) When you are afraid, Jehovah understands how you feel and he is eager to help you conquer your fears.
10. Why are you convinced that Jehovah notices you and that he will help you to cope with any trial?

Your answer


10 You may wonder, though, how Jehovah is supporting you while you face a frightening trial. So ask him to help you to see his support. (2 Ki. 6:15-17) Then consider: Has a talk or a comment at a congregation meeting strengthened you? Has a publication, a video, or an original song encouraged you? Has someone shared a reassuring thought or scripture with you? We might easily take for granted our loving brotherhood and the spiritual food we receive. Yet, they are extraordinary gifts from Jehovah. (Isa. 65:13; Mark 10:29, 30) They prove that he cares about you. (Isa. 49:14-16) And they prove that he is worthy of your trust.
11. What helped Aida to overcome her fears?

Your answer


11 Aida, who lives in Senegal, took note of how Jehovah supported her during a trial. Since she is the eldest child, her parents expected her to make enough money to care for both herself and them. But after she simplified her life in order to pioneer, Aida struggled financially. Her family now resented her and criticized her. “I was afraid that I would not be able to help my parents and that everyone would reject me,” she says. “I even blamed Jehovah for letting things get so bad.” Then she heard a talk at a meeting. “The speaker reminded us that whatever the wounds of our heart, Jehovah knows them. Little by little, through advice from the elders and others, I was reassured of Jehovah’s love. I began to pray to Jehovah with renewed confidence, and I felt a profound peace as I saw my prayers answered.” In time, Aida found employment that helped her not only to support herself as a pioneer but also to give financial aid to her parents and others. “I have learned to trust in Jehovah completely,” she says. “Now, after I pray, my fears often vanish.”
WHAT WILL JEHOVAH YET DO?
12. According to Psalm 56:9, of what was David confident?

Your answer


12 Read Psalm 56:9. This verse reveals another way that David conquered his fears. Even though his life was still in jeopardy, he meditated on what Jehovah would yet do for him. David knew that Jehovah would rescue him at the right time. After all, Jehovah had declared that David would be the next king of Israel. (1 Sam. 16:1, 13) To David, whatever Jehovah promised was as good as fulfilled.
13. What confidence can we have in Jehovah?

Your answer


13 What has Jehovah promised to do for you? We do not expect him to shield us from all problems.c Still, whatever trials you may face in this system of things, Jehovah will do away with them in the coming new world. (Isa. 25:7-9) Our Creator is surely strong enough to raise the dead, to heal us, and to remove all opposers.​—1 John 4:4.
14. What might we meditate on?

Your answer


14 When you feel afraid, meditate on what Jehovah will do in the future. Think about how you will feel when Satan is gone, when wicked people are replaced by righteous people, and when imperfection fades away a little more each day. A demonstration on the 2014 regional convention program depicted how we might meditate on our hope. A father discussed with his family how 2 Timothy 3:1-5 might be worded differently if those verses foretold what it would be like in Paradise: “In the new world the happiest of times will be here. For men will be lovers of others, lovers of spiritual treasures, modest, humble, praisers of God, obedient to parents, thankful, loyal, having great affection for their families, open to agreement, always speaking well of others, self-controlled, mild, lovers of goodness, trustworthy, yielding, lowly in mind, lovers of God rather than lovers of pleasures, motivated by genuine godly devotion; and to these people stick closely.” Do you discuss with your family or fellow believers what life will be like in the new world?
15. Although Tanja felt afraid, what helped her to conquer her fears?

Your answer


15 A sister in North Macedonia named Tanja conquered her fears by meditating on future blessings. Her parents strongly opposed her study of the Bible. She relates: “Some of the things that I feared would happen did happen. My mother beat me after every meeting. My parents threatened to kill me if I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Finally, Tanja was thrown out of her home. How did she react? She says: “I focused on how happy I would be for all eternity for choosing to keep my integrity. I also thought about how Jehovah would reward me in the new world for anything I might lose in this system and how all bad things would be forgotten.” Tanja did keep her integrity. And with Jehovah’s help, she found a place to live. Today, Tanja is married to a faithful brother and they serve happily together in the full-time ministry.
STRENGTHEN YOUR TRUST TODAY
16. What will help us to remain courageous when we see the events prophesied at Luke 21:26-28?

Your answer


16 During the great tribulation, people in general will become “faint out of fear.” But God’s people will remain steadfast and courageous. (Read Luke 21:26-28.) Why will we not give in to fear? Because we will have already learned to trust in Jehovah. Tanja, quoted earlier, says that her past experiences are helping her to face other unsettling situations. “I have learned that there is no situation that Jehovah cannot work out for our good,” she observes. “Sometimes it may seem that others are controlling things, but the reality is that they have only as much control as Jehovah allows. And though a trial may be hard, it will end.”
17. How will our 2024 yeartext help us? (See cover picture.)

Your answer


17 Fear is normal today. But like David, we can refuse to be trapped by fear. Our 2024 yeartext is David’s prayer to Jehovah: “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.” (Ps. 56:3) As one Bible reference work stated about this verse, David “neither feeds his fear nor stares at his problems but looks to his Redeemer who will deliver him.” Think about our yeartext in the coming months, especially when you are facing frightening situations. Take time to reflect on Jehovah’s actions in the past, present, and future. Then, like David, you can declare: “In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.”​—Ps. 56:4.
