<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">While a prisoner in Rome, Paul wrote to Timothy: “Bring the cloak I left at Troas.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:13-55:4:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ti 4:13</a>) The Greek word for “cloak” likely meant a traveling cloak, similar to the ones shown here. Such a cloak was an indispensable item of clothing in the first century C.E. It protected the wearer against cold or wet weather. These cloaks were often made from a piece of wool, linen, or leather to which a hood was attached. They could also serve as blankets, protecting the owner against the cold during the night. At the time Paul wrote his letter, winter was approaching, which may explain why he asked for his cloak.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:21-55:4:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ti 4:21</a>.</p>
