It can flourish even in poor or rocky soil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:8-5:8:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 8:8</a>) It has an immense root system that gathers water in the dry climate. Olive trees grow slowly and can live for over one thousand years. The olives turn from green to purple or black as they ripen, and then harvesters beat the branches to shake off the mature olives. In Bible times, olive trees were highly valued as the main source of edible oil. Olive oil was also used for skin care, medicine, and fuel for lamps.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:2-3:24:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 24:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:34-42:10:34" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Lu 10:34</a>.</p>
