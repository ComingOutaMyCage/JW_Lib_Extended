<p id="p4" data-pid="4">REASON(S): Available Greek manuscripts use the term “Lord” (<em>Kyʹri·os</em>) in this verse. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the title “Lord” is often used to refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. In this case, the reference is to Jehovah God. The context shows that Paul was not concerned about being judged by humans who, wholly unauthorized, in effect sat as “a human tribunal” to judge him. He did not even rely on his own judgment of himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:1-46:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 4:1-3</a>) In the Hebrew Scriptures, Jehovah God is described as the one who examines his servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:2-19:26:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 26:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:66:10-19:66:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 66:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:23-19:139:23" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 139:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:2-20:21:2" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Proverbs 21:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:12-24:20:12" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Jeremiah 20:12</a>) Therefore, it would have been natural for Paul to look to Jehovah as the one examining him. Additionally, scholars have noted that in this verse the Greek definite article is not included before <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. As in many other cases, the absence of the article would make <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name in this context. So in view of the Hebrew Scripture background as well as the absence of the Greek definite article, there are good reasons for using the divine name in this verse.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">Appendix C1</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18">REASON(S): The context clearly refers to God. The Greek verb <em>me·riʹzo,</em> here rendered “given . . . a portion,” is used elsewhere with a similar meaning and with God as the subject. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 12:3</a>, it is rendered “given” or, according to the footnote, “apportioned; distributed.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:13-47:10:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>, it is part of the expression rendered “measured out to us” or, according to the footnote, “apportioned [form of <em>me·riʹzo</em>] by measure to us.” These scriptures show that God is referred to as the one who apportions things to his servants.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24">REASON(S): Many Greek manuscripts use the term “the Lord” (<em>ton Kyʹri·on</em>) here; a few manuscripts use “(the) God” (<em>ton The·onʹ</em>). Some Greek manuscripts read <em>ton Khri·stonʹ,</em> “the Christ.” This reading is reflected in the Nestle-Aland Greek text and several modern Bible translations. However, not all scholars agree that “the Christ” is the original reading here. For example, the Greek text published by Westcott and Hort (1881) and the Greek text produced at Tyndale House, Cambridge (2017) use <em>ton Kyʹri·on</em> (“the Lord”) in their main text. Considering the Hebrew Scripture background, this would give reason to believe that the divine name was originally used in this verse and later replaced with the title “Lord” or “the Christ.” Paul is here referring to occasions when the Israelites put Jehovah God to the test, such as those mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:2-2:16:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Exodus 16:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:2-2:17:3" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 17:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:7-2:17:7" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 7</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:22-4:14:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Numbers 14:22</a>. The Greek word for “put to the test” (<em>ek·pei·raʹzo</em>) is also used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:7-40:4:7" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 4:7</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:12-42:4:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 4:12</a>, where Jesus quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:16-5:6:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>. The Hebrew text reads: “You must not put Jehovah your God to the test the way you put him to the test at Massah.” The Greek word used for “put . . . to the test” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:9-46:10:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:9</a> is also found in the <em>Septuagint</em> rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:16-5:6:16" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, where the Hebrew text contains the divine name. The occasion at Massah is described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:1-2:17:7" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Exodus 17:1-7</a>, where Moses asks the people: “Why do you keep putting <em>Jehovah</em> to the test?” In the latter part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:9-46:10:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:9</a>, Paul says, “as some of them put him to the test, only to perish by the serpents.” This refers to what is described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:5-4:21:6" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Numbers 21:5, 6</a>: “The people kept speaking against <em>God</em> and Moses,” and <em>“Jehovah</em> sent poisonous serpents among the people.” Paul may also have alluded to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:18-19:78:18" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 78:18</a>, where the psalmist says that the Israelites “challenged [lit., “tested”] <em>God</em> in their heart.” These scriptures clearly show that God is the one whom the Israelites “put . . . to the test.” So in view of the context and the Hebrew Scripture background, there are solid reasons for using the divine name here.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33">REASON(S): Available Greek manuscripts read “Lord’s cup,” but there are good reasons for using the divine name in the main text. In this passage, Paul is warning against idolatry. He may have had in mind the cup of wine symbolizing Christ’s blood at the Lord’s Evening Meal, to which he refers just five verses earlier. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:16-46:10:16" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>) There he calls it “the cup of blessing that we bless.” When Jesus instituted this observance, he said a blessing, or prayer, before passing the cup to his disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:27-40:26:28" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matthew 26:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Luke 22:19, 20</a>) Following his pattern, prayer is offered on “the cup” before those in the new covenant drink from it. However, it was Jehovah who made the provision of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice; it was to Jehovah that Jesus offered the merit of his sacrifice; it was the will of Jehovah that governed how that sacrifice would be used; and it was Jehovah who foretold and instituted the new covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>) So it is proper to speak of “the cup of Jehovah” and “the table of Jehovah.” It is worth noting that in this verse, the Greek definite article is not used before <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. This absence of the definite article makes <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name. Also, when the term <em>Kyʹri·os</em> appears in the following verse, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:22-46:10:22" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:22</a>, there is a clear allusion to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:21-5:32:21" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, where the context (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:19-5:32:21" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:19-21</a>) shows that Jehovah is the one saying: “They have incited me to fury [or “jealousy,” ftn.] with what is not a god.” So considering the context, the Hebrew Scripture background, and the absence of the Greek definite article, the divine name is used in the main text.</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50">REASON(S): In the Hebrew Scriptures, Jehovah God is described as the one disciplining his servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:2-5:11:2" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 11:2</a>) For example, as found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:6" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a>, Paul quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11, 12</a>, which reads: “My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah, . . . for those whom Jehovah loves he reproves.” In this scripture quoted by Paul, the divine name, represented by four Hebrew consonants (transliterated <em>YHWH</em>), occurs in the original Hebrew text, and therefore the name Jehovah is used in the main text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:6" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a> in the <em>New World Translation.</em> The Greek terms for “discipline” and “to discipline,” used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:6" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a> and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:32-46:11:32" data-bid="74-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>, are the same as those used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:12" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11, 12</a> in the <em>Septuagint.</em> So Paul’s words about being disciplined may echo the same Hebrew Scripture proverb. This Hebrew Scripture background supports using the divine name in the main text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:32-46:11:32" data-bid="76-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>. It is worth noting that in this verse many Greek manuscripts omit the definite article before the Greek word <em>Kyʹri·os.</em> Therefore, in recent scholarly editions of the Greek text, the definite article is either put in brackets (Greek text by Nestle-Aland) or not included at all in the main text (Greek texts by Society of Biblical Literature and by Tyndale House, Cambridge). The absence of the definite article before <em>Kyʹri·os</em> would make the term tantamount to a proper name.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p52" data-pid="52">  In his book <em>Synonyms of the Old Testament,</em> Second Edition, 1897, Robert Baker Girdlestone, late principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, made this comment about the use of the divine name in the so-called New Testament. The statement was made before manuscript evidence came to light showing that the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> originally contained the name Jehovah. Girdlestone said: “If that [<em>Septuagint</em>] version had retained the word [Jehovah], or had even used one Greek word for <strong>Jehovah</strong> and another for <strong>Adonai,</strong> such usage would doubtless have been retained in the discourses and arguments of the N. T. [New Testament]. Thus our Lord, in quoting the 110th Psalm, instead of saying, ‘The Lord said unto my Lord,’ might have said, <strong>‘Jehovah</strong> said unto <strong>Adoni.’”</strong> Girdlestone goes on to comment on the challenge of determining when the divine name should appear in the New Testament text: “Supposing a Christian scholar were engaged in translating the Greek Testament into Hebrew, he would have to consider, each time the word Κύριος [<em>Kyʹri·os</em>] occurred, whether there was anything in the context to indicate its true Hebrew representative; and this is the difficulty which would arise in translating the N. T. [New Testament] into all languages if the title <strong>Jehovah</strong> had been allowed to stand in the [Greek <em>Septuagint</em> translation of the] O. T. [Old Testament]. The Hebrew Scriptures would be a guide in many passages: thus, wherever the expression ‘the angel of the Lord’ occurs, we know that the word Lord represents <strong>Jehovah;</strong> a similar conclusion as to the expression ‘the word of the Lord’ would be arrived at, if the precedent set by the O. T. were followed; so also in the case of the title ‘the Lord of Hosts.’ Wherever, on the contrary, the expression ‘My Lord’ or ‘Our Lord’ occurs, we should know that the word <strong>Jehovah</strong> would be inadmissible, and <strong>Adonai</strong> or <strong>Adoni</strong> would have to be used. But many passages would remain for which no rules could be framed.” As seen in the following, a number of Bible translators have decided to use the divine name in this verse. Some use the Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton; others use such forms as Yahweh, YAHVAH, or YHWH.</p>

However, Paul presents these words as spoken by God in the first person (“I will speak”). To make clear who made this statement, Paul adds after the quote a phrase that, according to available Greek manuscripts, reads “says Lord.” However, this phrase occurs hundreds of times in the <em>Septuagint</em> to translate Hebrew phrases for “declares Jehovah”; “says Jehovah”; “this is what Jehovah says.” For examples, see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:11-23:1:11" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:18-23:49:18" data-bid="79-3" class="b"> 49:18</a> (quoted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:11-45:14:11" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Romans 14:11</a>); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:4-23:52:5" data-bid="81-1" class="b">52:4, 5</a>.
