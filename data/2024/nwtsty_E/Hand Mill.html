(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:35-42:17:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 17:35</a>) They sat facing each other, each placing one hand on the handle to turn the upper stone. With her free hand, one woman fed grain in small amounts into the filler hole of the upper stone while the other woman gathered the flour as it emerged from the rim of the mill and fell to the tray or the cloth spread beneath the mill. Women ground grain each day, rising early in the morning to prepare the flour needed for bread for the day.</p>
