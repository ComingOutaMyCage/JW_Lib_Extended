<p id="p5" data-pid="5">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: Here the context indicates that the Lord referred to is God. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:19-49:2:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Verse 19</a> describes the Christian congregation as “the household of God.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verse 20</a> indicates that Jesus is “the foundation cornerstone” of this building, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:22-49:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">verse 22</a> says that this temple is “a place for God to inhabit by spirit.” Also, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">verse 20</a>, Paul alludes to the Messianic prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:16-23:28:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a>, where “the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Here I am laying as a foundation in Zion a tested stone, the precious cornerstone of a sure foundation.’” Additionally, in the Hebrew Scriptures, expressions similar to the combination “temple for [or “of”] Jehovah” often include the Tetragrammaton. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:16-12:18:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:4-12:23:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 23:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:13-12:24:13" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 24:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:16" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 26:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:27:2-14:27:2" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 27:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:24:1-24:24:1" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> Jeremiah 24:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:16-26:8:16" data-bid="7-7" class="b"> Ezekiel 8:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:15-37:2:15" data-bid="7-8" class="b"> Haggai 2:15</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:9$p/E:1001070645/25-25:686">study note on Luke 1:9</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079342/16-22">comment on Luke 1:9</a> in Appendix C3.) It is also worth noting that in this verse, the Greek definite article is not used before <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord), where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. The absence of the definite article makes <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name. So in view of the immediate context, the Hebrew Scripture background, and the absence of the Greek definite article, it is reasonable to connect the temple mentioned here with Jehovah’s name.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: The Greek term for “will” (<em>theʹle·ma</em>), as used in the Christian Greek Scriptures, is most often connected with God’s will.

In the <em>Septuagint,</em> the Greek term <em>theʹle·ma</em> is often used to translate Hebrew expressions for God’s will, or delight, and can be found in passages where the divine name occurs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:8-19:40:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8, 9</a> [39:9 (8), 10 (9), <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:21-19:103:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">103:21</a> [102:21, <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:9-19:143:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">143:9-11</a> [142:9-11, <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:24-23:44:24" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:28-23:44:28" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:24-24:9:24" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 9:24</a> [9:23 (24), <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:10-39:1:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Malachi 1:10</a>) So in view of the way the Greek word for “will” is used in the Bible, the background of this expression in the Hebrew Scriptures, and the background of the term <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> the divine name is used in the main text. Also, some translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures use the divine name here.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: Available Greek manuscripts use the term “Lord” (Greek, <em>Kyʹri·os</em>) here. However, as explained in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">Appendix C1</a>, there are good reasons to believe that the divine name was originally used in this verse and later replaced with the title Lord. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> can refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. In the Hebrew Scriptures, Jehovah God is described as the one disciplining his servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:2-5:11:2" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 11:2</a>) For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5</a>, Paul quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:11" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11</a>, which reads: “My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah.” In this scripture quoted by Paul, the divine name, represented by four Hebrew consonants (transliterated <em>YHWH</em>), occurs in the original Hebrew text. Therefore, the name “Jehovah” is used in the main text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:5" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5</a> in the <em>New World Translation.</em> The Greek noun for “discipline,” used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:5" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5</a> and here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>, is the same as the one used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:11-20:3:11" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:11</a> in the <em>Septuagint.</em> So the expression that Paul uses here, “the discipline . . . of Jehovah,” is apparently an allusion to the same Hebrew Scripture proverb. This expression may also allude to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:5-23:50:5" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isaiah 50:5</a> according to the <em>Septuagint,</em> where the phrase that literally reads “the discipline of Lord opens my ears” translates the Hebrew phrase “the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear.” Also, it is noteworthy that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>, the Greek definite article was not included before <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. The absence of the definite article makes <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name. So the Hebrew Scripture background and the absence of the definite article indicate that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> is here used as a substitute for the divine name.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: Available Greek manuscripts read “to the Lord” (<em>toi Ky·riʹoi</em>) in this verse. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the title <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) is often used to refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. It may also refer to humans having authority over others. In this chapter, the Greek term <em>kyʹri·os</em> (lord; master) is used several times. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:5-49:6:5" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:9-49:6:9" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 9</a>, the plural form is rendered “masters”; at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:9-49:6:9" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:9</a>, <em>kyʹri·os</em> appears in the expression “both their <em>Master</em> and yours.” Here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:7-49:6:7" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:7</a>, it is obvious that <em>kyʹri·os</em> does not refer to a human master. A clue about whom the Lord here refers to can be found in the similar counsel to slaves that Paul gives in his letter to the Colossians. (See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070053/">Introduction to Ephesians</a>.”) According to available Greek manuscripts of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:22" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Colossians 3:22</a>, Paul uses the phrase “fearing the Lord.” In all other occurrences in the Christian Greek Scriptures where the Greek verb for “to fear” is used in the sense of reverence, the object of this reverential fear is God. It would therefore be natural to understand “the Lord” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:22" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Colossians 3:22</a> as referring to God. This expression also echoes wording in the <em>Septuagint</em> that is used to render the Hebrew word for “to fear” and the Tetragrammaton. Some examples are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:13-5:6:13" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:12-5:10:12" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 10:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:20-5:10:20" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:4-5:13:4" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 13:4</a> (13:5 [4], <em>LXX</em>). So in view of how the Greek term for “to fear” is used in the Christian Greek Scriptures and the Hebrew Scripture background of this expression, the rendering “with fear of Jehovah” is used in the main text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:22" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Colossians 3:22</a>. This supports the conclusion that “the Lord” referred to in the very similar context here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:7-49:6:7" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:7</a> is Jehovah. Another indication that the Lord mentioned here refers to Jehovah God is the phrase “doing the will of God whole-souled” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:6-49:6:6" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:6</a>. Both in the Hebrew Scriptures and in the Christian Greek Scriptures, references to doing something with one’s whole soul are always connected with Jehovah God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:5-5:6:5" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> Matthew 22:37</a>.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: The reasons for using the divine name in the main text of this verse are generally the same as the reasons for using it at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:7-49:6:7" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:7</a>. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079349/39-45">comment on Ephesians 6:7</a>.) Also, it is worth noting that before <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> there is no Greek definite article, where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. The absence of the definite article makes <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name. Additionally, the Greek expression <em>pa·raʹ Ky·riʹou,</em> here rendered “from Jehovah,” occurs a few more times in the Christian Greek Scriptures, and in all occurrences, there are good reasons to render it “from Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:42-40:21:42" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Matthew 21:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:11-41:12:11" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> Mark 12:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:45-42:1:45" data-bid="65-3" class="b"> Luke 1:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:18-55:1:18" data-bid="65-4" class="b"> 2 Timothy 1:18</a>) This expression also appears in existing copies of the <em>Septuagint</em> as a translation of Hebrew expressions in which the divine name is typically used. Similar to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:8-49:6:8" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:8</a>, some of these scriptures describe Jehovah as the one who blesses those faithfully serving him and rewards their good deeds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:12-8:2:12" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:20-9:1:20" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:5-19:24:5" data-bid="67-3" class="b"> Psalm 24:5</a> [23:5, <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:39-19:37:39" data-bid="68-1" class="b">37:39</a> [36:39, <em>LXX</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:121:2-19:121:2" data-bid="69-1" class="b">121:2</a> [120:2, <em>LXX</em>]) So in view of the context, the Hebrew Scripture background, and the absence of the definite article in Greek, the divine name is used in the main text.</p>
