Paul’s Letter to the Hebrews




Shown here is a page from the papyrus codex referred to as P46. This codex contains nine of Paul’s inspired letters, although they are placed in an order different from the one found in most modern-day Bibles. For example, the letter to the Hebrews comes immediately after the letter to the Romans. (See Media Gallery, “Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians.”) The leaf shown above is kept at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. The end of Paul’s letter to the Romans can be seen at the top of the page. (In this manuscript, the letter to the Romans ends with what is chapter 16, verse 23, in modern-day Bible translations; the remainder of the letter, what is now Ro 16:25-27, appears at the end of chapter 15.) The title of the letter that follows (highlighted in the photo) reads “Toward [or, “To”] Hebrews.” It is worth noting that the letter to the Hebrews is here included among other letters written by Paul. This fact, along with others, supports the conclusion that Paul was the writer of this inspired letter. The codex is believed to date from about the year 200 C.E., that is, about 150 years after Paul originally penned his letters.​—See “Introduction to Hebrews.”
