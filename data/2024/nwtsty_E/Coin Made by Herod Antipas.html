<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">These photos show both sides of a copper alloy coin that was minted about the time that Jesus was engaged in his ministry. The coin was commissioned by Herod Antipas, who was <a class="xt" data-xtid="74" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077387/">tetrarch</a>, or district ruler, of Galilee and Perea. Jesus was likely passing through Herod’s territory of Perea on his way to Jerusalem when the Pharisees told Jesus that Herod wanted to kill him. Jesus responded by calling Herod “that fox.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/13:32$p/E:1001070657/29-29:1128">study note on Lu 13:32</a>.) Since most of Herod’s subjects were Jewish, the coins he made depicted such emblems as a palm branch (1) and a wreath (2), images that would not offend the Jews.</p>
