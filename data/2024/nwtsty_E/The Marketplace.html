<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Some marketplaces, like the one depicted here, were located along a road. Vendors often placed so much merchandise in the street that it blocked traffic. Local residents could buy common household goods, pottery, and expensive glassware, as well as fresh produce. Because there was no refrigeration, people needed to visit the market each day to buy supplies. Here a shopper could hear news brought in by traders or other visitors, children could play, and the unemployed could wait to be hired. In the marketplace, Jesus healed the sick and Paul preached. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:17-44:17:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 17:17</a>) By contrast, the proud scribes and Pharisees loved to be noticed and greeted in these public areas.</p>
