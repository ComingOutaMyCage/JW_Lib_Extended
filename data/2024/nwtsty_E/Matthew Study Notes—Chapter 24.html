<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Truly:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/5:18$p/E:1001070605/40-40:498">study note on Mt 5:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone:</strong> Jesus’ prophecy was remarkably fulfilled in 70 C.E. when the Romans demolished Jerusalem and its temple. Apart from a few sections of the wall, the city was completely leveled.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>24:3</strong></a></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>Mount of Olives:</strong> Located E of Jerusalem and separated from the city by the Kidron Valley. From this vantage point, Jesus and his disciples “Peter, James, John, and Andrew” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:3-41:13:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mr 13:3, 4</a>) could view the city and its temple.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>presence:</strong> The Greek word <em>pa·rou·siʹa</em> (in many translations rendered “coming”) literally means “being alongside.” It refers to a presence covering a period of time rather than simply a coming or an arrival. This meaning of <em>pa·rou·siʹa</em> is indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 24:37-39</a>, where “the days of Noah . . . before the Flood” are compared to “the presence of the Son of man.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:12-50:2:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Php 2:12</a>, Paul used this Greek word to describe his “presence” in contrast to his “absence.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>conclusion:</strong> Rendered from the Greek word <em>syn·teʹlei·a,</em> meaning “joint end; combination end; ending together.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:39-40:13:40" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mt 13:39, 40,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:49-40:13:49" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 49;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 28:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:26-58:9:26" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Heb 9:26</a>) This refers to a time period during which a combination of events would lead to the complete “end” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:6-40:24:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mt 24:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14</a>, where a different Greek word, <em>teʹlos,</em> is used.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:6$p/E:1001070624/14-14:217">study notes on Mt 24:6,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:14$p/E:1001070624/36-36:65"> 14</a> and Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="72" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077064/">Conclusion of the system of things</a>.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>the system of things:</strong> Or “the age.” Here the Greek word <em>ai·onʹ</em> refers to the current state of affairs or to features that distinguish a certain period of time, epoch, or age.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="69" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077313/">System(s) of things</a>.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:5-40:24:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>24:5</strong></a></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>the Christ:</strong> Greek, <em>ho Khri·stosʹ.</em> The title “the Christ” is equivalent to “the Messiah” (from Hebrew <em>ma·shiʹach</em>), both meaning “Anointed One.” Jewish historian <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a> indicates that in the first century C.E., some who claimed to be prophets or liberators arose, promising relief from Roman oppression. These may have been viewed by their followers as political Messiahs.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:6-40:24:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>24:6</strong></a></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>end:</strong> Or “complete end.” The Greek word used here (<em>teʹlos</em>) is different from the Greek word rendered “conclusion” (<em>syn·teʹlei·a</em>) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 24:3</a>.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:3$p/E:1001070624/9-9:400">study note on Mt 24:3</a> and Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="72" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077064/">Conclusion of the system of things</a>.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>24:7</strong></a></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>nation:</strong> The Greek word <em>eʹthnos</em> has a broad meaning and can refer to people living within certain political or geographical boundaries, such as a country, but can also refer to an ethnic group.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:14$p/E:1001070624/34-34:664">study note on Mt 24:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>rise:</strong> Or “be stirred up; be roused up.” Here the Greek word conveys the idea “to move against in hostility” and could also be rendered “rise up in arms” or “go to war.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:8-40:24:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>24:8</strong></a></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>pangs of distress:</strong> The Greek word literally refers to the intense pain experienced during childbirth. While it is used here to refer to distress, pain, and suffering in a general sense, it may suggest that like birth pains the foretold troubles and suffering will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration in the time period before the great tribulation mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mt 24:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>24:9</strong></a></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>on account of my name:</strong> In the Bible, the term “name” at times stands for the person who bears the name, his reputation, and all that he represents. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/6:9$p/E:1001070606/19-19:529">study note on Mt 6:9</a>.) In the case of Jesus’ name, it also stands for the authority and position that his Father has given him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mt 28:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:10" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Php 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:3-58:1:4" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Heb 1:3, 4</a>) Jesus here explains that people would hate his followers because of what his name represents, that is, his position as God’s appointed Ruler, the King of kings, the one to whom all people should bow in submission in order to gain life.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/15:21$p/E:1001070683/14-14:732">study note on Joh 15:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:10-40:24:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>24:10</strong></a></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>will be stumbled:</strong> In the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, the Greek word <em>skan·da·liʹzo</em> refers to stumbling in a figurative sense, which may include falling into sin or causing someone to fall into sin. As the term is used in the Bible, the sin may involve breaking one of God’s laws on morals or losing faith or accepting false teachings. In this context, the term could also be rendered “will be led into sin; will fall away from the faith.” The Greek word can also be used in the sense of “to take offense.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/13:57$p/E:1001070613/67-67:380">study notes on Mt 13:57;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/18:7$p/E:1001070618/8-8:594"> 18:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>24:12</strong></a></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>lawlessness:</strong> The Greek word rendered “lawlessness” includes the idea of violation of and contempt for laws, people acting as if there were no laws. As used in the Bible, it suggests disregard for God’s laws.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:23-40:7:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mt 7:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:14" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2Co 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:3-53:2:7" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 2Th 2:3-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:4-62:3:4" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 1Jo 3:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>the greater number:</strong> Referring not just to “many” in a general sense as some Bibles render this but to “the majority” of those who have been influenced by “false prophets” and “lawlessness,” as mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:11-40:24:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mt 24:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>24:13</strong></a></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>has endured:</strong> Or “endures.” The Greek verb rendered “to endure” (<em>hy·po·meʹno</em>) literally means “to remain (stay) under.” It is often used in the sense of “remaining instead of fleeing; standing one’s ground; persevering; remaining steadfast.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:22-40:10:22" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mt 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Ro 12:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:32-58:10:32" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Heb 10:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> Jas 5:11</a>) In this context, it refers to maintaining a course of action as Christ’s disciples despite opposition and trials.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 24:9-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>end:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:6$p/E:1001070624/14-14:217">study notes on Mt 24:6,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:14$p/E:1001070624/36-36:65"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>24:14</strong></a></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>this good news:</strong> The Greek word <em>eu·ag·geʹli·on</em> is derived from the words <em>eu,</em> meaning “good; well” and <em>agʹge·los,</em> “one who brings news; one who proclaims (announces).” (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="95" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077124/">Glossary</a>.) It is rendered “<a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">gospel</a>” in some English Bibles. The related expression rendered “evangelizer” (Greek, <em>eu·ag·ge·li·stesʹ</em>) means “a proclaimer of good news.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:8-44:21:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ac 21:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:11-49:4:11" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Eph 4:11</a>, ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2Ti 4:5</a>, ftn.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>the Kingdom:</strong> That is, God’s Kingdom. Throughout the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, the “good news” (see preceding study note on <strong>this good news</strong> in this verse) is closely linked with God’s Kingdom, the theme of Jesus’ preaching and teaching work.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:2$p/E:1001070603/10-10:437">study notes on Mt 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/4:23$p/E:1001070604/61-61:251"> 4:23;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/4:43$p/E:1001070648/59-59:424"> Lu 4:43</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>preached:</strong> Or “publicly proclaimed.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:1$p/E:1001070603/6-6:199">study note on Mt 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>all the inhabited earth . . . all the nations:</strong> Both expressions emphasize the scope of the preaching work. In a broad sense, the Greek word for “inhabited earth” (<em>oi·kou·meʹne</em>) refers to the earth as the dwelling place of mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Lu 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:31-44:17:31" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ac 17:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:18-45:10:18" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Ro 10:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> Re 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="26-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>) In the first century, this term was also used in reference to the vast Roman Empire, where the Jews had been dispersed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:1-42:2:1" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Lu 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:5-44:24:5" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ac 24:5</a>) In its general sense, the Greek word for “nation” (<em>eʹthnos</em>) refers to a group of people who are more or less related to one another by blood and who have a common language. Such a national or ethnic group often occupies a defined geographic territory.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>for a witness:</strong> Or “for a testimony,” that is, an assurance that <strong>all the nations</strong> would hear the good news. The Greek word <em>mar·tyʹri·on</em> (witness; testimony) and related Greek words often refer to a recounting of the facts and events related to a subject. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/1:8$p/E:1001070690/15-15:1243">study note on Ac 1:8</a>.) In this case, Jesus says that there would be a worldwide testimony of what God’s Kingdom would accomplish and a recounting of events related to that Kingdom. Jesus indicates that the global Kingdom-preaching work itself would be an important feature of “the sign of [his] presence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mt 24:3</a>) The fact that all the nations would receive this witness does not mean that all the nations would convert to true Christianity​—only that they would hear the testimony.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5"><strong>end:</strong> Or “complete end; final end.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:3$p/E:1001070624/9-9:400">study notes on Mt 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/24:6$p/E:1001070624/14-14:217"> 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>24:15</strong></a></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="s5"><strong>the disgusting thing that causes desolation:</strong> Daniel foretold that “disgusting thing(s)” would be associated with desolation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:27-27:9:27" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Da 9:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:31-27:11:31" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 11:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:11-27:12:11" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 12:11</a>) Jesus here indicates that “the disgusting thing that causes desolation” had not yet appeared; it was to come in the future. And 33 years after Jesus’ death, Christians witnessed the initial fulfillment of this prophecy when they did <strong>catch sight</strong> of a disgusting thing <strong>standing in a holy place.</strong> The parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:20" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Lu 21:20</a> reads: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by <em>encamped armies,</em> then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.” In 66 C.E., pagan Roman armies surrounded “the holy city,” Jerusalem, a place that the Jews viewed as holy and that was the center of the Jewish revolt against Rome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:5-40:4:5" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mt 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:53-40:27:53" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 27:53</a>) Discerning Christians, who recognized that the Roman army with its idolatrous banners was “the disgusting thing,” took it as the final signal to “begin fleeing to the mountains.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:16" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mt 24:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:43-42:19:44" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Lu 19:43, 44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:22" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 21:20-22</a>) After the Christians fled, the Romans desolated both the city and the nation. Jerusalem was destroyed in the year 70 C.E., and the last Jewish stronghold, Masada, fell to the Romans in 73 C.E. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:25-27:9:27" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Da 9:25-27</a>.) The detailed initial fulfillment of this prophecy provides a solid basis for trusting that the greater fulfillment will also take place, culminating with Jesus’ “coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:30-40:24:30" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mt 24:30</a>) Many ignore Jesus’ statement that Daniel’s prophecy would be fulfilled after Jesus’ day, and they follow Jewish tradition in applying Daniel’s prophecy to an event in 168 B.C.E. when Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes) profaned Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem. Antiochus attempted to stamp out the worship of Jehovah, even building an altar over the great altar of Jehovah and sacrificing pigs as an offering to the pagan god Zeus of Olympus. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/10:22$p/E:1001070678/22-22:2234">study note on Joh 10:22</a>.) The apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (1:54) uses an expression similar to the one found in the book of Daniel (associating disgusting things with desolation) and applies it to the event in 168 B.C.E. However, Jewish tradition and the account in 1 Maccabees are human interpretations, not inspired revelations. Certainly, Antiochus provoked feelings of disgust by desecrating the temple, but his attack did not result in the desolation of Jerusalem, the temple, or the Jewish nation.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="s5"><strong>holy place:</strong> Referring in the initial fulfillment of this prophecy to Jerusalem with its temple.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/4:5$p/E:1001070604/10-10:126">study note on Mt 4:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="s5"><strong>(let the reader use discernment):</strong> Readers should always use discernment when studying God’s Word, but there is apparently a special need to be alert to the application of this portion of Daniel’s prophecy. Jesus was cautioning his hearers that the fulfillment of this prophecy was not in the past but was yet future.​—See the study note on <strong>the disgusting thing that causes desolation</strong> in this verse.</p>
