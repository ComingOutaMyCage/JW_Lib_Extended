MATTHEW
Study Notes​—Chapter 17

17:1
a lofty mountain: Possibly Mount Hermon, which is near Caesarea Philippi. (See study note on Mt 16:13.) It reaches a height of 2,814 m (9,232 ft) above sea level. The transfiguration may have taken place on one of the spurs of Mount Hermon.​—See App. B10.
17:2
he was transfigured: Or “he was transformed; his appearance was changed.” The same Greek verb (me·ta·mor·phoʹo) occurs at Ro 12:2.
17:3
look!: See study note on Mt 1:20.
17:5
a voice: The second of three instances in the Gospel accounts where Jehovah is reported as speaking audibly to humans.​—See study notes on Mt 3:17; Joh 12:28.
whom I have approved: Or “with whom I am well-pleased.”​—See study notes on Mt 3:17; 12:18.
17:9
Son of man: See study note on Mt 8:20.
17:14
knelt down: In the ancient Near East, kneeling was a posture that expressed respect, especially when petitioning superiors.
17:15
an epileptic: See study note on Mt 4:24.
17:20
your little faith: The Greek expression is related to the term rendered “you with little faith” at Mt 6:30; 8:26; 14:31; 16:8; Lu 12:28. Jesus does not imply that his disciples were entirely without faith but, rather, that their faith needed to be stronger.​—See study notes on Mt 6:30; 8:26.
truly: See study note on Mt 5:18.
the size of a mustard grain: Or “as small as a mustard seed.”​—See study notes on Mt 13:31, 32.
17:21
Some ancient manuscripts here read: “However, this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.” (See study note on Mr 9:29.) But these words do not appear in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts and are evidently not part of the inspired Scriptures.​—See App. A3.
17:24
Capernaum: See study note on Mt 4:13.
the two drachmas tax: Lit., “the double drachmas.” (See App. B14.) Various temple services were maintained through taxation. (Ex 30:12-16) Apparently, by Jesus’ day it had become customary for each adult male Jew to contribute a fixed amount as an annual temple tax.
17:26
the sons are tax-free: In Jesus’ day, the family members of monarchs were known to be tax-exempt.
17:27
fishhook: The only occurrence in the Christian Greek Scriptures of the Greek word rendered “fishhook,” likely a baited hook cast into the water on the end of a line. Every other mention of fishing equipment in the Christian Greek Scriptures refers to nets.
silver coin: Lit., “stater.” This coin is considered to be the tetradrachma. (See App. B14.) It was worth four drachmas, the equivalent of a shekel, which was exactly the amount required to pay the temple tax for two.​—Ex 30:13.
