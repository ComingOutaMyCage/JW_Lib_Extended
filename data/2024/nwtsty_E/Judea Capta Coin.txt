Judea Capta Coin




In his great prophecy about what would happen to Jerusalem and its temple, Jesus foretold that the inhabitants of Judea would “be led captive into all the nations.” (Lu 21:21, 24) The coin shown here is a striking testimony to the fulfillment of Jesus’ words. Such coins commemorating the capture of Judea were first minted in 71 C.E. One side of the coin contains an image of Titus, the son of Emperor Vespasian. Titus completed the conquest of Judea that Vespasian had begun. The other side shows a palm tree flanked by a captive Judean male with his hands tied behind his back and a seated Jewish woman in mourning. The inscription reads “IVDAEA CAPTA,” meaning “Captive Judea.”
