Paul Is Imprisoned but Unconquered




Paul is imprisoned in Rome a second time. He knows that his death is imminent. (2Ti 4:6) To add to his concerns, some of his associates, including Demas, have abandoned him. (2Ti 1:15; 4:10) But Paul has good reason to be happy. Several courageous brothers were not ashamed of supporting him. (2Ti 4:21) Onesiphorus, for instance, searched all over Rome in order to find Paul. (2Ti 1:16, 17) In spite of his prison chains, Paul remains unconquered. He focuses on the reward that is reserved for him in Christ’s “heavenly Kingdom.” (2Ti 4:8, 18) Even during this difficult time, Paul thinks, not of himself, but of others. From prison he writes his second inspired letter to Timothy, encouraging him to continue to be faithful.​—2Ti 1:7, 8; 2:3.
