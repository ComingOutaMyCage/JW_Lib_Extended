The Greek word <em>he·dyʹo·smon,</em> “mint,” (literally, sweet-smelling) likely embraced the various known kinds of mint found in Israel and Syria, including the common horsemint (<em>Mentha longifolia</em>). Dill (<em>Anethum graveolens</em>) is cultivated for its aromatic seeds, which are valued as a spice for flavoring foods and as a medicine for treating stomach ailments. The cumin plant (<em>Cuminum cyminum</em>) is of the carrot or parsley family and is best known for its pungently aromatic seeds, used in <a class="xt" data-xtid="70" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077356/">Middle Eastern</a> and other countries as a spice for flavoring bread, cakes, stews, and even liquors.</p>
