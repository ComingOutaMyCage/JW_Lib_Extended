<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Sabbath:</strong> The Sabbath day (Nisan 15) ended at sunset. All four <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> accounts contain the report of Jesus’ resurrection.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:1-40:28:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 28:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:1-41:16:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mr 16:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:1-42:24:12" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Lu 24:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:1-43:20:29" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Joh 20:1-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>Mary Magdalene:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/27:56$p/E:1001070627/101-101:332">study note on Mt 27:56</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>James:</strong> That is, James the Less.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/15:40$p/E:1001070643/74-74:243">study note on Mr 15:40</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>Salome:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/15:40$p/E:1001070643/76-76:609">study note on Mr 15:40</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>bought spices . . . apply them to his body:</strong> Jesus’ body had already been prepared for burial “according to the burial custom of the Jews.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:39-43:19:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joh 19:39, 40</a>) However, since Jesus died about three hours before the start of the Sabbath and the Jews were not allowed to do such work during the Sabbath, this task was likely done hastily. Now, on this first day after the Sabbath, that is, the third day from Jesus’ execution, the women may have come to add more spices and oils, perhaps as a means of preserving the body for a longer period. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:50-42:24:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lu 23:50–24:1</a>) Likely, they would apply the spices and oils over the wrapped body.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>the first day of the week:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/28:1$p/E:1001070628/5-5:127">study note on Mt 28:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>the stone:</strong> Apparently a circular stone, since this verse says that the women asked about who would “roll the stone away,” and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:4-41:16:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">verse 4</a> says that it “had been rolled away.” It might have weighed a ton or more. Matthew’s account calls it “a big stone.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:60-40:27:60" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mt 27:60</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:7-41:16:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>16:7</strong></a></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>tell his disciples:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/28:7$p/E:1001070628/10-10:386">study note on Mt 28:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>and Peter:</strong> Mark is the only <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> writer to include the detail that Peter was specifically named in the angel’s message. (Compare the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:7-40:28:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 28:7</a>.) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:2-43:20:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joh 20:2</a> says that Mary Magdalene brought the message “to Simon Peter and to the other disciple,” that is, John. Sometime before Jesus appeared to his disciples as a group, he apparently appeared to Peter when Peter was alone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:34-42:24:34" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Lu 24:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:5-46:15:5" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1Co 15:5</a>) This personal attention, plus the specific mention of Peter in this angelic message, no doubt reassured Peter that he had been forgiven for three times denying any association with his friend.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:73-40:26:75" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mt 26:73-75</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:8-41:16:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>16:8</strong></a></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>for they were in fear:</strong> According to the earliest available <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> of the last part of Mark, the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> ends with the words found in verse 8. Some assert that such an ending is too abrupt to have been the original conclusion to the book. However, in view of Mark’s generally terse writing style, that assertion is not necessarily valid. Also, fourth-century scholars <a class="xt" data-xtid="117" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077375/">Jerome</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="96" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077372/">Eusebius</a> indicate that the authentic record closes with the words “for they were in fear.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5">There are a number of Greek manuscripts and translations into other languages that add either a long or a short conclusion after verse 8. The long conclusion (consisting of 12 extra verses) is found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="118" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077420/">Codex Alexandrinus</a>, Codex Ephraemi Syri rescriptus, and Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, all from the fifth century C.E. It also appears in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="97" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077389/"> <em>Vulgate</em></a><em>,</em> the Curetonian Syriac, and the Syriac <em>Peshitta.</em> However, it does not appear in two earlier fourth-century Greek manuscripts, <a class="xt" data-xtid="119" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077421/">Codex Sinaiticus</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="120" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077422/">Codex Vaticanus</a>, or in Codex Sinaiticus Syriacus of the fourth or fifth century, or in the earliest Sahidic <a class="xt" data-xtid="121" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077371/">Coptic</a> manuscript of Mark of the fifth century. Similarly, the oldest manuscripts of Mark in <a class="xt" data-xtid="122" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077419/">Armenian</a> and Georgian end at verse 8.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5">Certain later Greek manuscripts and translations into other languages contain the short conclusion (consisting of just a couple of sentences). The Codex Regius of the eighth century C.E. has both conclusions, giving the shorter conclusion first. It prefaces each conclusion with a note saying that these passages are current in some quarters, though it evidently recognizes neither of them as authoritative.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5">SHORT CONCLUSION</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5">The short conclusion after <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:8-41:16:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mr 16:8</a> is not part of the inspired Scriptures. It reads as follows:</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><span class="altsize">But all the things that had been commanded they related briefly to those around Peter. Further, after these things, Jesus himself sent out through them from the east to the west the holy and incorruptible proclamation of everlasting salvation.</span></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5">LONG CONCLUSION</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5">The long conclusion after <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:8-41:16:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mr 16:8</a> is not part of the inspired Scriptures. It reads as follows:</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">After he rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magʹda·lene, from whom he had expelled seven demons.</span> <strong><sup>10</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">She went and reported to those who had been with him, as they were mourning and weeping.</span> <strong><sup>11</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">But they, when they heard he had come to life and had been viewed by her, did not believe.</span> <strong><sup>12</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">Moreover, after these things he appeared in another form to two of them walking along, as they were going into the country;</span> <strong><sup>13</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">and they came back and reported to the rest. Neither did they believe these.</span> <strong><sup>14</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">But later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table, and he reproached their lack of faith and hardheartedness, because they did not believe those who had beheld him now raised up from the dead.</span> <strong><sup>15</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">And he said to them: “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.</span> <strong><sup>16</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">He that believes and is baptized will be saved, but he that does not believe will be condemned.</span> <strong><sup>17</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">Furthermore, these signs will accompany those believing: By the use of my name they will expel demons, they will speak with tongues,</span> <strong><sup>18</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">and with their hands they will pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly it will not hurt them at all. They will lay their hands upon sick persons, and these will become well.”</span></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">So, then, the Lord Jesus, after having spoken to them, was taken up to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <strong><sup>20</sup></strong> <span class="altsize">They, accordingly, went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and backed up the message through the accompanying signs.</span></p>
