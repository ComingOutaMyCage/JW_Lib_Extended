<p id="p4" data-pid="4">REASON(S): Although most Greek manuscripts read “the Lord” (<em>ho Kyʹri·os</em>) here, there are good reasons for using the divine name in the main text. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> can refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. Here the context shows that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> is used with reference to God. Speaking to the man who had been healed, Jesus is attributing the miracle, not to himself, but to his heavenly Father. In recording the same event, Luke (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:39-42:8:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">8:39</a>) uses the Greek word <em>The·osʹ</em> (God), supporting the thought that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:19-41:5:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 5:19</a> is used with reference to God. Additionally, the phrases “the things . . . done for you” and “mercy . . . shown you” have a bearing on the matter, as corresponding Hebrew verbs are often used in the Hebrew Scriptures, along with the divine name, with reference to Jehovah’s dealings with humans.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:1-1:21:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 21:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:8-2:13:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Exodus 13:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:34-5:4:34" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Deuteronomy 4:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:17-5:13:17" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 13:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:3-5:30:3" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 30:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:7-9:12:7" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 1 Samuel 12:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:30-9:25:30" data-bid="4-7" class="b"> 25:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:13:23-12:13:23" data-bid="4-8" class="b"> 2 Kings 13:23</a>.</p>

However, he goes on to acknowledge that “the hearers may have understood [this expression] more vaguely, as denoting God, perhaps with special reference to his covenant relations with his people, as expressed by the Hebrew name <em>Jehovah,</em> for which the constant equivalent or rather substitute both in the Septuagint and the New Testament is (ὁ κύριος) the Lord.”</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16">REASON(S): Although most Greek manuscripts use the word <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) here, there are good reasons for using the divine name in the main text. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> can refer to Jehovah God or to Jesus Christ, depending on the context. Here the context shows that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> is used with reference to God, since Jesus was explaining to his disciples what his Father will do during the great tribulation. The wording of Jesus’ prophecy here is similar to that of prophetic statements in the Hebrew Scriptures where the divine name is used. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:9-23:1:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:8-23:65:8" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 65:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:28-24:46:28" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 46:28</a> [26:28, <em>Septuagint</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:9:8-30:9:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Amos 9:8</a>) In these four prophetic verses where the Hebrew text contains the Tetragrammaton, existing copies of the <em>Septuagint</em> use <em>Kyʹri·os</em> without the definite article, where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. Similarly, scholars have noted the unexpected lack of the definite article before <em>Kyʹri·os</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:20-41:13:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 13:20</a>. This is another indication that <em>Kyʹri·os</em> is here used as a substitute for the divine name.</p>
