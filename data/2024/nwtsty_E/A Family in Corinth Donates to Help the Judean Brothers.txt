A Family in Corinth Donates to Help the Judean Brothers




This artistâ€™s rendering shows a family in Corinth contributing what they have set aside on a regular basis to provide relief to their brothers in Judea. (1Co 16:2) The family cheerfully cooperates with those in the congregation who are responsible for organizing this relief work. Because these parents teach their son to contribute, the child learns the greater joy that comes from giving. (Ac 20:35) A year before, the Corinthian congregation had expressed readiness to donate. (2Co 8:10, 11) So in his second inspired letter, Paul encourages the congregation to complete this act of kindness.
