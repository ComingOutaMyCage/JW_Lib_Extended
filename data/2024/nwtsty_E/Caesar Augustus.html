He was the adoptive son of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar, who was murdered in 44 B.C.E. In September of 31 B.C.E., Octavius emerged as the undisputed ruler of the Roman Empire, and on January 16, 27 B.C.E., the Roman Senate gave him the title Augustus. In 2 B.C.E., Augustus issued a decree requiring all inhabitants of the empire to be registered, each one in “his own city.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:1-42:2:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 2:1-7</a>) This decree resulted in Jesus’ being born in Bethlehem, in fulfillment of Bible prophecy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:20-27:11:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Da 11:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mic 5:2</a>) Augustus died on August 17, 14 C.E. (August 19, Julian calendar), in the month he had named after himself. The bronze sculpture shown here dates from 27 to 25 B.C.E. and is now kept in the British Museum.</p>
