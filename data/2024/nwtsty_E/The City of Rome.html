<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Rome, the capital city of the Roman Empire, was located on the Tiber River and was built on an area that has seven hills. As the empire flourished, the city expanded. By the middle of the first century C.E., Rome may have had a population of one million people, including a sizable Jewish community. The first Christians in Rome were likely Jews and proselytes who had been in Jerusalem at Pentecost 33 C.E. and had heard the apostle Peter and the other disciples preach. These new disciples would have brought the good news with them when they returned to Rome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:10-44:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 2:10</a>) In his letter to the Romans, which was written about 56 C.E., the apostle Paul said that the faith of those disciples in Rome was “talked about throughout the whole world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ro 1:7, 8</a>) This video shows an artist’s rendering of some key features of Rome as they may have looked in Paul’s day.</p>
