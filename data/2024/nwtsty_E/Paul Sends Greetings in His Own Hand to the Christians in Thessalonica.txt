Paul Sends Greetings in His Own Hand to the Christians in Thessalonica




As Silvanus and Timothy look on, Paul signs his second letter to the Thessalonians. Apparently, some Christians there believed that Jehovah’s day was imminent. Perhaps this idea originated from a letter, supposedly from Paul, that was circulating in the Thessalonian congregation. (2Th 2:1, 2) But Paul warned the brothers that such an idea was wrong. To confirm that he was the author of this letter, Paul included a greeting in his own hand.
