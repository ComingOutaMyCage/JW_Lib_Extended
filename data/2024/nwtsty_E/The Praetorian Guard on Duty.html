<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Members of the Praetorian Guard normally wore a tunic (1)Â and sometimes a cloak (2). This type of clothing allowed for freedom of movement. Even though the tunic was commonly worn by Romans, non-Romans, and slaves, soldiers were easily identified by their military weapons, belts, and sandals. However, the soldiers wore a different garment, called a toga (3), whenever they were within the city limits of Rome and whenever they guarded the emperor. The toga was formal attire for male Roman citizens.</p>
