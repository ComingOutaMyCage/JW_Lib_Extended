<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In Bible times, clothing was among a person’s most important belongings. Dorcas generously made “garments and robes” for those who were widows. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:39-44:9:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 9:39</a>) The Greek word rendered “garment” (<em>khi·tonʹ</em>) refers to a kind of tunic; it could also be translated “inner garment” (1). According to Greek and Roman custom, men usually wore tunics that were short and women usually wore tunics that went down to the ankles. The Greek word rendered “robe” (<em>hi·maʹti·on</em>) could also be translated “outer garment” (2) and refers to a kind of garment that was usually worn over the tunic, or inner garment.</p>
