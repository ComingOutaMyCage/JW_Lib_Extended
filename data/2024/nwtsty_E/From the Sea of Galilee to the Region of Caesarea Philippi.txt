From the Sea of Galilee to the Region of Caesarea Philippi




Jesus and his disciples traveled by boat from Magadan to Bethsaida, which is located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. (Mr 8:​22) This body of water is 210 m (nearly 700 ft) below sea level. They probably spent some days making the 40 km (25 mi) ascent to Caesarea Philippi, which was located at an elevation of 350 m (1,150 ft) above sea level.​—For comprehensive maps of Jesus’ ministry, see Appendix A7-E.
