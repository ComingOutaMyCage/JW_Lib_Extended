It is the location of the ancient city of Antioch, capital of the Roman province of Syria. In the first century C.E., Antioch of Syria is said to have been the third-largest city in the Roman world, after Rome and Alexandria. Some estimate that its population was 250,000 or more. After Stephen was murdered by a mob in Jerusalem and persecution broke out against Jesus’ followers, some disciples of Jesus came to Antioch. They preached the good news with much success among Greek-speaking people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:19-44:11:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 11:19-21</a>) Later, the apostle Paul used Antioch as a home base for his missionary tours. “It was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:26-44:11:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 11:26</a>) Antioch of Syria is not to be confused with another city named Antioch, in Pisidia (central Türkiye), mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:14-44:13:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:21-44:14:21" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 21</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:11-55:3:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ti 3:11</a>.</p>
