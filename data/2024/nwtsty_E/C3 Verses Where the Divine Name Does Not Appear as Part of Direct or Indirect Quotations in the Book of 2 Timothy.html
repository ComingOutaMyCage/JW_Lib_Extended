<p id="p5" data-pid="5">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:18-55:1:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:18</a>, the Greek word for “Lord” (<em>Kyʹri·os</em>) appears twice. The first occurrence is preceded by the definite article and is rendered “the Lord.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070159/1:18$p/E:1001070797/64-64:839">study note on 2 Timothy 1:18</a>.) However, in the second occurrence, the definite article does not appear before <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord), where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. The absence of the definite article here makes <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name and may indicate that a proper name originally appeared in the Greek text. Many scholars recognize that the absence of the definite article makes this second occurrence of <em>Kyʹri·os</em> correspond to the divine name.</p>

<h4 id="p12" data-pid="12"><em>Kingdom Interlinear:</em> <q class="scrp">“naming the name of Lord”</q></h4>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: Paul’s wording suggests that the statement “let everyone calling on the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness” is a quote from the Hebrew Scriptures. Yet, no text in the Hebrew Scriptures exactly matches Paul’s words. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070159/2:19$p/E:1001070798/50-50:801">study note on 2 Timothy 2:19</a>.) The expression “calling on the name of Jehovah” seems to allude to the wording at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:13-23:26:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:13</a> according to the <em>Septuagint.</em> The original Hebrew text of that verse clearly refers to the divine name. Scholars have suggested other scriptures from which these words may be quoted, for example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:16-3:24:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus 24:16</a> according to the <em>Septuagint.</em> Additionally, some Bible commentators have noted that this phrase resembles the phrase “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah” that appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:32-29:2:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joel 2:32</a> and that is quoted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:21-44:2:21" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:21</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 10:13</a>. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/2:21$p/E:1001070691/28-28:163">study notes on Acts 2:21;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/10:13$p/E:1001070727/23-23:230"> Romans 10:13</a>.) Further, the Greek definite article is missing before <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord), where it would be expected according to standard grammatical usage. This absence of the definite article makes <em>Kyʹri·os</em> tantamount to a proper name and may indicate that a proper name originally appeared in the Greek text.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20">REASON(S) FOR RESTORING THE DIVINE NAME: Paul echoes several verses in the Hebrew Scriptures that refer to Jehovah God as the one who repays humans for their actions, whether good or bad. One example is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:12-19:62:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 62:12</a>, where the psalmist says: “O Jehovah, . . . you repay each one according to his deeds.” (See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:28:1-19:28:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 28:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:28:4-19:28:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:12-20:24:12" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Proverbs 24:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:64-25:3:64" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Lamentations 3:64</a>.) Paul makes a similar point at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:6-45:2:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 2:6</a>, where he says about God: “He will pay back to each one according to his works.” And at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:19-45:12:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 12:19</a>, which says: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,” Paul quotes Jehovah’s words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:35-5:32:35" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>. Although the Greek definite article is here used before the term for “Lord,” the clear Hebrew Scripture background supports using the divine name in the main text. Also, one reference work notes that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:14-55:4:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:14</a>, which uses the Greek verb for “repay,” God is the subject of the sentence, just as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:4-40:6:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 6:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:6-40:6:6" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:18-40:6:18" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 18</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:6-45:2:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 2:6</a>.​—<em>Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by Horst Balz and Gerhard Schneider, 1990, Vol. 1, pages 127-128.</p>
