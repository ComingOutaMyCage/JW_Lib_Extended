Locusts




As used in the Bible, the term “locusts” can refer to any of a variety of grasshoppers with short antennas, or feelers, especially grasshoppers that migrate in great swarms. According to an analysis made in Jerusalem, desert locusts consist of 75 percent protein. When used for food today, they are prepared by roasting, boiling, frying, or drying. Usually, the legs and wings are removed. These insects are said to taste something like shrimp or crab and are rich in protein.
