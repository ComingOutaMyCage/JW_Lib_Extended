(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:1-44:18:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 18:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:11-44:18:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:2-44:20:3" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 20:2, 3</a>) At that time, the city of Corinth was a thriving commercial center, thanks in large part to its strategic location on the isthmus that connects the Peloponnesian Peninsula to the Greek mainland. This allowed the city to control the flow of goods at two nearby ports, Lechaeum and Cenchreae. Corinth was a crossroads for merchants and travelers from all over the Roman Empire, making it an ideal location to carry out the preaching work. In this video, learn about Corinth’s history, including archaeological discoveries, such as the Erastus inscription. See the city’s agora (marketplace), bema (judgment seat), and one of its theaters as it may have appeared in Paul’s day.</p>
