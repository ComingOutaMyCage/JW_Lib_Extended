A Place of Prayer Near Philippi




The photograph shows the Crenides (Krenides) stream, which flowed just outside the western Krenides Gate of ancient Philippi. It may be the “river” where Paul preached to a group of women who had gathered for prayer, though opinions on the precise location vary.​—Ac 16:13-15.
