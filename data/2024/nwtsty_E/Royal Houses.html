<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">When Jesus referred to those living in “royal houses” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:25-42:7:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 7:25</a>) or “houses of kings” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:8-40:11:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 11:8</a>), his listeners may have been reminded of the many luxurious palaces built by Herod the Great. Shown in the photograph are remains of just one part of a winter palace complex that he built in Jericho. This building included a colonnaded reception hall measuring 29 by 19 m (95 by 62 ft), colonnaded courtyards surrounded by many rooms, and a bathhouse that incorporated heating and cooling systems. Connected to the palace was a multitiered garden. This palace may have been burned during an uprising that occurred a few decades before John the Baptist began his ministry, and it was rebuilt by Herod’s son, Archelaus.</p>
