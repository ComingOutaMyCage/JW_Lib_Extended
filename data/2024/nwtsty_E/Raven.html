<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">The raven is the first bird specifically named in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:7-1:8:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 8:7</a>) It is a powerful flier and is considered to be one of the most adaptable and resourceful of all birds. When teaching Job a lesson regarding the wisdom reflected in creation, Jehovah said that He “prepares food for the raven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:41-18:38:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:41</a>) The psalmist indicated that Jehovah kindly provides the food brought by parent ravens to quiet the cries of their hungry young. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:9-19:147:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 147:9</a>) Jesus referred to the ravens in a similar way to assure his followers that the One caring for such birds would surely provide for the needs of His human servants. According to the Law covenant, ravens were unclean, not fit to be eaten. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:13-3:11:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 11:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:15-3:11:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Since God provides for unclean ravens, we can be certain that he will never forsake people who trust in him.</p>
