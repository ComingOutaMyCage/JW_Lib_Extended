Codex Sinaiticus​—End of Mark’s Gospel




The Codex Sinaiticus is a vellum manuscript written in Greek and dating from the fourth century C.E. It contains all of the Christian Greek Scriptures and portions of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures known as the Septuagint. Scholars consider Codex Sinaiticus to be one of the authoritative sources for the Greek Bible text. Until the mid-1800’s, the manuscript was located in St. Catherine’s Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. Today, a major part of this manuscript, including the section shown here, is preserved at the British Library in London, England. This photo shows the end of the Gospel of Mark (1) and the beginning of Luke’s account (2). In both this manuscript and the equally important fourth-century manuscript known as the Codex Vaticanus, Mark’s account clearly concludes with the words that appear in modern Bibles at Mark 16:8.​—See study note on Mr 16:8.
