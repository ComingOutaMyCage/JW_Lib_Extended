<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Malta:</strong> The Greek text uses the term <em>Me·liʹte,</em> which for centuries has been identified with the modern-day island of Malta. The ship on which Paul traveled was forced southward by strong winds, from Cnidus on the SW tip of Asia Minor to below Crete. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:7-44:27:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 27:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:12-44:27:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:21-44:27:21" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 21</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:27-44:27:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 27:27</a>, the record says that the ship was “being tossed about on the Sea of Adria,” which in Paul’s day applied to an area larger than the present-day Adriatic Sea. It included the Ionian Sea and waters E of Sicily and W of Crete, thus encompassing the sea near modern-day Malta. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/27:27$p/E:1001070716/27-27:623">study note on Ac 27:27</a>.) In view of the prevailing winds of the storm called Euroaquilo (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:14-44:27:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 27:14</a>), it is likely that the ship was driven W and shipwrecked on the island of Malta, S of Sicily. Over the years, some scholars have suggested other islands as the Biblical <em>Me·liʹte.</em> One theory singled out an island near Corfu, off the western coast of Greece. Another suggestion is based on the Greek word <em>Me·liʹte</em> and points to Melite Illyrica, now known as Mljet, located off the coast of Croatia in the present-day Adriatic Sea. However, in view of the Bible’s description of the route, it is unlikely that the ship turned and sailed as far northward as Corfu or Mljet.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070234/">App. B13</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>the foreign-speaking people:</strong> Or “the local inhabitants.” Some older Bible translations render the Greek word <em>barʹba·ros</em> used here as “Barbarians.” The repetition of <em>“bar bar”</em> in this Greek word conveyed the idea of stammering, babble, or unintelligible speech, so the Greeks originally used the term to refer to a foreigner who spoke a different language. At that time, the term did not denote lack of civilization, refinement, or good manners; nor did it convey contempt. The word <em>barʹba·ros</em> simply distinguished non-Greeks from Greeks. Some Jewish writers, including <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a>, recognized themselves as being designated by the term. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XIV, 187 [x, 1]; <em>Against Apion,</em> I, 58 [11]) In fact, Romans called themselves barbarians until they adopted Greek culture. So the term was applied here to the inhabitants of Malta, who apparently spoke their native, unrelated language, likely Punic.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/1:14$p/E:1001070718/37-37:831">study note on Ro 1:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>kindness:</strong> Or “human kindness.” The Greek word <em>phi·lan·thro·piʹa</em> literally means “affection (love) for mankind.” Such kindness could include the idea of having genuine interest in others and showing hospitality in caring for human needs and comforts. As shown here, people may display this godly quality even before they come to know Jehovah. A similar example is recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:3-44:27:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 27:3</a>, where the related word <em>phi·lan·throʹpos</em> is used to describe the way that the army officer Julius treated Paul. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:4-56:3:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Tit 3:4</a>, the Greek word <em>phi·lan·thro·piʹa</em> is used to describe Jehovah’s feelings and is rendered “love for mankind.”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>a viper:</strong> In modern times, vipers are not found on the island of Malta. But as this account shows, the first-century inhabitants knew of these snakes. Over the centuries, environmental changes or the increase in human population may have eradicated this species from Malta.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:4-44:28:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>28:4</strong></a></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>Justice:</strong> The Greek term for “Justice” here is <em>diʹke.</em> It may refer to a goddess who personifies avenging justice or to the concept of justice. In Greek mythology, Dike was the name of the goddess of justice. It was thought that she had oversight of human affairs and reported undisclosed injustices to Zeus so that the guilty would be punished. The inhabitants of Malta may have thought that, although he had survived the shipwreck, Paul was now overtaken by some sort of divine justice and punished by means of a snake.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:11-44:28:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>28:11</strong></a></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>Sons of Zeus:</strong> According to Greek and Roman mythology, the “Sons of Zeus” (Greek, <em>Di·oʹskou·roi</em>) were Castor and Pollux, twin sons of the god Zeus (Jupiter) and the Spartan Queen Leda. Among other things, they were regarded as the protectors of mariners, able to save sailors imperiled at sea. This detail regarding the ship’s figurehead is another testimony that the account was written by an eyewitness.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>Syracuse:</strong> A city with a fine harbor, located on the SE coast of the island of Sicily, today called Siracusa. According to Greek historian Thucydides, it was founded by the Corinthians in 734 B.C.E. Syracuse was the birthplace of some well-known figures of ancient times. For example, the mathematician Archimedes was born there. In 212 B.C.E., the Romans conquered Syracuse.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070234/">App. B13</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>Puteoli:</strong> Now called Pozzuoli, this chief port SE of Rome was located about 10 km (6 mi) WSW of Naples. Extensive ruins of an ancient breakwater, or mole, are still visible. <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a> calls the site by its older name, Dicaearchia, and says that a Jewish colony was located there. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVII, 328, xii, 1) Paul, on his way to stand before Caesar in Rome, arrived at Puteoli about the year 59 C.E. The ship arrived from <strong>Rhegium</strong> (now called Reggio di Calabria), a port city at the southern tip of Italy across from Sicily, some 320 km (200 mi) to the SSE of Puteoli. Christian brothers in Puteoli entreated Paul and those accompanying him to spend a week with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:14-44:28:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ac 28:14</a>) This indicates that, although he was a prisoner, Paul enjoyed some freedom.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070234/">App. B13</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:14-44:28:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>28:14</strong></a></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>so we went toward Rome:</strong> It would have taken up to a week to make the journey from Puteoli to Rome, which was 245 km (152 mi) away. Paul and his companions likely went from Puteoli to Capua and from there traveled 212 km (132 mi) to Rome on the Appian Way (<a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a>, <em>Via Appia</em>). The Appian Way was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman statesman who began building it in 312 B.C.E. It eventually linked Rome with the port of Brundisium (modern-day Brindisi), a gateway to the E. Much of the road was paved with large blocks of volcanic rock. The road varied greatly in width​—some portions were less than 3 m (10 ft) wide and other portions were more than 6 m (20 ft) wide. The general criterion was that two vehicles traveling in opposite directions could pass at the same time without hindering each other. At certain points, the Mediterranean Sea was visible. The road crossed the Pontine Marshes, a swampy area that caused one Roman writer to complain about the mosquitoes and foul smell. A canal was built along the road, so when the road was flooded, travelers used canal boats to travel through the area. Located just N of those marshes were the Marketplace of Appius, about 65 km (40 mi) from Rome, and Three Taverns, a rest stop some 50 km (30 mi) from the city.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:15-44:28:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>28:15</strong></a></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>the Marketplace of Appius:</strong> Or “Forum of Appius.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a>, <em>Appii Forum.</em> A marketplace about 65 km (40 mi) SE of Rome. It was a well-known station on the famous Roman highway Via Appia, running from Rome to Brundisium (now Brindisi) by way of Capua. Both the road and the marketplace draw their names from the founder, Appius Claudius Caecus, of the fourth century B.C.E. As the usual point at which travelers halted at the close of the first day’s journey out of Rome, this post station became a busy trading center and market town. Adding to its importance was its location on a canal that ran alongside the road, traversing the Pontine Marshes. Travelers reportedly were conveyed over this canal by night in barges pulled by mules. The Roman poet Horace describes the discomforts of the journey, complaining of the frogs and mosquitoes and depicting the Marketplace of Appius as “crammed with boatmen and stingy tavern-keepers.” (<em>Satires,</em> I, V, 1-6) Despite all the discomforts, however, the delegation from Rome happily waited for Paul and his companions in order to escort them safely along the final leg of their journey. Today the site of the Foro Appio, or Forum of Appius, is marked by the small village of Borgo Faiti, located on the Appian Way.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070234/">App. B13</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>Three Taverns:</strong> Or “Tres Tabernae.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a>, <em>Tres Tabernas.</em> This place, which is also mentioned in other ancient writings, was situated on the Appian Way. The site is some 50 km (31 mi) SE of Rome, about 15 km (9.5 mi) from the Marketplace of Appius. Today, a few Roman ruins remain at this site.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070234/">App. B13</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>by bearing thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God:</strong> With the exception of the book of John, Acts contains the Greek words rendered “witness” (<em>marʹtys</em>), “to bear witness” (<em>mar·ty·reʹo</em>), “to bear thorough witness” (<em>di·a·mar·tyʹro·mai</em>), and related words more times than any other Bible book. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:7$p/E:1001070669/20-20:984">study notes on Joh 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/1:8$p/E:1001070690/15-15:1243"> Ac 1:8</a>.) The idea of being a witness and bearing thorough witness about God’s purposes, including his Kingdom and Jesus’ vital role, is the theme that runs through the book of Acts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:32-44:2:32" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ac 2:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:40-44:2:40" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:15-44:3:15" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:33-44:4:33" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 4:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:32-44:5:32" data-bid="19-5" class="b"> 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:25-44:8:25" data-bid="19-6" class="b"> 8:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:39-44:10:39" data-bid="19-7" class="b"> 10:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:31-44:13:31" data-bid="19-8" class="b"> 13:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:5-44:18:5" data-bid="19-9" class="b"> 18:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:21-44:20:21" data-bid="19-10" class="b"> 20:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="19-11" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:20-44:22:20" data-bid="19-12" class="b"> 22:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:11-44:23:11" data-bid="19-13" class="b"> 23:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:16-44:26:16" data-bid="19-14" class="b"> 26:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>this salvation from God:</strong> Or “this, the means by which God saves.” The Greek word <em>so·teʹri·on</em> may refer not only to salvation but also to the means by which salvation or deliverance is brought about. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:30-42:2:30" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Lu 2:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:6-42:3:6" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 3:6</a>; ftns.)

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5">Some later Greek <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> and some ancient translations into other languages add: “And when he had said this, the Jews went away, having a great deal of disputing among themselves.” However, these words do not appear in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts and are apparently not part of the original text of Acts.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070203/17-17">App. A3</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>he remained there for an entire two years:</strong> During this two-year period, Paul wrote his letter to the Ephesians (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:1-49:4:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Eph 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:20-49:6:20" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 6:20</a>), to the Philippians (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:7-50:1:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Php 1:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:12-50:1:14" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 12-14</a>), to the Colossians (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:18-51:4:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Col 4:18</a>), to Philemon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:9-57:1:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Phm 9</a>), and apparently also to the Hebrews. His house arrest seems to have ended in about the year 61 C.E. when he apparently was tried​—perhaps before Emperor Nero or one of his representatives​—and pronounced innocent. After his release, Paul characteristically remained active. It could have been during this period that he made his planned trip to Spain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:28-45:15:28" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ro 15:28</a>) According to Clement of Rome, who wrote in about the year 95 C.E., Paul traveled “to the extreme limit of the W[est],” that is, of the Roman Empire. Paul’s three letters dated to the years after his release (1 and 2 Timothy and Titus) reveal that he probably visited Crete, Ephesus, Macedonia, Miletus, Nicopolis, and Troas. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:3-54:1:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1Ti 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:13-55:4:13" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2Ti 4:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:20-55:4:20" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:5" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> Tit 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:12-56:3:12" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> 3:12</a>) Some suggest that it was in Nicopolis, Greece, that Paul was again arrested and that he was back in prison in Rome in about the year 65 C.E. This time, it seems that Nero showed no mercy. A fire had devastated Rome the year before, and according to Roman historian <a class="xt" data-xtid="101" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077385/">Tacitus</a>, Nero falsely blamed the Christians. Nero then initiated a brutal campaign of persecution against them. When Paul wrote his second and final letter to Timothy, he expected to be executed soon, so he asked Timothy and Mark to come quickly. During this time, Luke and Onesiphorus showed great courage and risked their lives to visit Paul and comfort him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:16-55:1:17" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2Ti 1:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:6-55:4:9" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 4:6-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:11-55:4:11" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 11</a>) It was likely in about the year 65 C.E. that Paul was executed. In both life and death, Paul was an outstanding witness to “all the things Jesus started to do and to teach.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:1-44:1:1" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ac 1:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5"><strong>preaching:</strong> The Greek word basically means “to make proclamation as a public messenger.” It stresses the <em>manner</em> of the proclamation: usually an open, public declaration rather than a sermon to a group. The theme of this preaching was <strong>the Kingdom of God.</strong> In the book of Acts, the expression “the Kingdom of God” occurs six times. The first occurrence is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:3-44:1:3" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ac 1:3</a>, describing Jesus’ speaking about this Kingdom during the 40 days between his resurrection and his ascension. The Kingdom of God continued to be the theme that dominated the preaching of the apostles.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:12-44:8:12" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ac 8:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:22-44:14:22" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 14:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:8-44:19:8" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 19:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:23-44:28:23" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 28:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s5"><strong>with the greatest freeness of speech:</strong> Or “with all boldness (fearlessness).” The Greek word <em>par·re·siʹa</em> has also been rendered “outspokenness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ac 4:13</a>) This noun and the related verb <em>par·re·si·aʹzo·mai,</em> often rendered “speak boldly [with boldness],” occur several times in the book of Acts. Boldness was, from the beginning of Luke’s account to the end, an identifying mark of the preaching done by the early Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:29-44:4:29" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ac 4:29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:27-44:9:28" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 9:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:46-44:13:46" data-bid="36-4" class="b"> 13:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:3-44:14:3" data-bid="36-5" class="b"> 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:26-44:18:26" data-bid="36-6" class="b"> 18:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:8-44:19:8" data-bid="36-7" class="b"> 19:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:26-44:26:26" data-bid="36-8" class="b"> 26:26</a>.</p>
