Symmachus’ Greek Translation Containing the Hebrew Tetragrammaton




Shown here is a portion of a third or fourth century C.E. parchment fragment of Symmachus’ Greek translation of Ps 69:30, 31 (Ps 68:31, 32, Septuagint). Symmachus produced the original translation in the second century C.E. This fragment is known as P. Vindobonensis Greek 39777 and is now in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. The part shown here contains two occurrences of the divine name written in archaic Hebrew characters ( or ) within the Greek text. The words of Mary at Lu 1:46 may echo the thought of Ps 69:30, 31, where the divine name also occurs in the original Hebrew text. The Hebrew Scripture background of Mary’s expression of praise as well as the use of the Tetragrammaton in this Greek translation provides support for using the divine name in the main text of Lu 1:46.—See study note on Lu 1:46 and Appendix C.
