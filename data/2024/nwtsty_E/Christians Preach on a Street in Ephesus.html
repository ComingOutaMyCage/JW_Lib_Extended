<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">The street in ancient Ephesus that led from the city’s large theater to its busy harbor was spacious and lined with colonnades. Ephesus was a crossroads of the ancient world. On this street, Christians could preach “the good news of peace” to people of all sorts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:15-49:6:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph 6:15</a>) The apostle Paul, who wrote the letter to the Ephesians, was familiar with Ephesus; he had preached there for some three years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 20:17, 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:31-44:20:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 31</a>) As a result of Paul’s ministry in Ephesus, “all those living in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:10-44:19:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 19:10</a>) This fruitful territory yielded a vibrant congregation that continued to grow.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:20-44:19:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 19:20</a>.</p>
