<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>illustration:</strong> Or “parable.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/13:3$p/E:1001070613/7-7:399">study note on Mt 13:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>ten:</strong> As shown in the study note on <strong>drachma coins</strong> in this verse, a drachma was worth almost a day’s wages. However, this lost coin may have had special value as one of a set of ten, perhaps an heirloom or part of a prized string of drachmas used for adornment. It was necessary to <strong>light a lamp</strong> to search for it because the window in a home, if there was one, was usually quite small. And houses at that time generally had clay floors, so the woman swept the floor to help her find the lost coin.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>drachma coins:</strong> A drachma was a Greek silver coin. By the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry, the drachma probably weighed about 3.4 g (0.109 oz t). At that time, the Greeks equated the drachma with the denarius, but the Roman government officially reckoned the value of the drachma at three fourths of a denarius. The Jews paid an annual temple tax of two drachmas (a didrachma).​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/17:24$p/E:1001070617/26-26:265">study note on Mt 17:24</a>; Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="126" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077086/">Drachma</a>”; and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070236/">App. B14</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>the drachma coin:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/15:8$p/E:1001070659/7-7:439">study note on Lu 15:8</a>; Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="126" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077086/">Drachma</a>”; and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070236/">App. B14</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>A man had two sons:</strong> Some aspects of the illustration of the prodigal son (also known as “the lost son”) are unique. It is one of the longest that Jesus gave. An outstanding feature is the family relationships he describes. In other illustrations, Jesus often referred to inanimate things, such as different kinds of seed or soil, or to the formal relationship between a master and his slaves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:18-40:13:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mt 13:18-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:14-40:25:30" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 25:14-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:12-42:19:27" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Lu 19:12-27</a>) In this illustration, however, Jesus highlights the intimate relationship between a father and his sons. Many who hear this account may not have had such a kind, warmhearted father. This illustration portrays the deep compassion and love that our heavenly Father has for his earthly children, both those who remain with him and those who return to him after going astray.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>the younger one:</strong> According to the Mosaic Law, the firstborn received a double share. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:17-5:21:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 21:17</a>) So in this illustration, the inheritance of the younger son would have been half that of his older brother.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:13-42:15:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>15:13</strong></a></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>squandered:</strong> The Greek word used here literally means “to scatter (in different directions).” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:51-42:1:51" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Lu 1:51;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:37-44:5:37" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ac 5:37</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:24-40:25:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 25:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:26-40:25:26" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 26</a>, it is rendered “winnow.” Here it is used in the sense of being wasteful, spending foolishly.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>a debauched life:</strong> Or “a wasteful (reckless; wild) life.” A related Greek word is used with a similar meaning at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:18-49:5:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:6-56:1:6" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Tit 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:4-60:4:4" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1Pe 4:4</a>. Since the Greek word may also include the idea of a spendthrift, or wasteful, lifestyle some Bible translations use the expression “with prodigal living.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>to herd swine:</strong> These animals were unclean according to the Law, so this was a degrading, despicable occupation for a Jew.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:7-3:11:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Le 11:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:16-42:15:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>15:16</strong></a></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>carob pods:</strong> The fruit or pods of the carob have a shiny, leathery shell of a purplish-brown color and, in harmony with the literal meaning of their name in Greek (<em>ke·raʹti·on,</em> “small horn”), have a curved horn shape. Carob pods are widely used till this day as food for horses, cattle, and pigs. The degradation to which the young man had sunk was accentuated by his willingness even to eat the food of swine.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/15:15$p/E:1001070659/18-18:133">study note on Lu 15:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>against you:</strong> Or “in your sight.” The Greek preposition <em>e·noʹpi·on,</em> literally meaning “before; in the sight of,” is used in a similar way at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:20:1-9:20:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Sa 20:1</a> in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a><em>.</em> In that verse, David asks Jonathan: “How have I sinned <em>against</em> your father?”</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>hired men:</strong> When he returned home, the younger son planned to ask his father to be accepted, not as a son, but as a hired man. Such a man was not part of the estate, as were the slaves, but was an outsider who was hired, often for just a day at a time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:1-40:20:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mt 20:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:8-40:20:8" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:20-42:15:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>15:20</strong></a></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>tenderly kissed him:</strong> Or “affectionately kissed him.” The Greek term rendered “tenderly kissed” has been understood to be an intensive form of the verb <em>phi·leʹo,</em> sometimes rendered “to kiss” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:48-40:26:48" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mt 26:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:44-41:14:44" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Mr 14:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:47-42:22:47" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Lu 22:47</a>) but more often having the meaning “to have affection for” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:20-43:5:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Joh 5:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:3-43:11:3" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 11:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:27-43:16:27" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 16:27</a>). By greeting him in such a warm, friendly manner, the father in the illustration shows his willingness to welcome back his repentant son.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:21-42:15:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>15:21</strong></a></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>called your son:</strong> Some <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> add: “Make me as one of your hired men,” but the current main text reading has support in various early, authoritative manuscripts. Some scholars consider that the extra expression was added to make the verse harmonize with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:19-42:15:19" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Lu 15:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:22-42:15:22" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>15:22</strong></a></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>robe . . . ring . . . sandals:</strong> This robe was not merely a simple article of clothing but <strong>the best one</strong>​—perhaps a richly embroidered vestment of the sort presented to an honored guest. The act of putting a ring on the hand of his son shows the favor and affection of the father as well as the dignity, honor, and status accorded this restored son. A ring and sandals were not usually seen on slaves. Thus, the father was making it clear that his son was being welcomed back as a full-fledged member of the family.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:30-42:15:30" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>15:30</strong></a></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>squandered:</strong> Lit., “devoured.” The Greek word is here used to give a graphic description of how the younger son wasted his father’s <strong>belongings,</strong> or means of living.</p>
