<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Shown here are the front and back of the Papyrus Rylands 457 (P<sup>52</sup>) fragment, a very early copy of a portion of John’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>. Housed at the John Rylands University Library in Manchester, England, it was acquired in Egypt in 1920. It preserves a portion of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:31-43:18:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 18:31-33</a> on one side and a portion of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 18:37, 38</a> on the other. The presence of writing on both sides of the papyrus is clear evidence that it was part of a codex. The fragment measures 9 by 6 cm (3.5 by 2.4 in.). Many scholars consider it to be the oldest extant Greek <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscript</a> of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, dating it to sometime in the first half of the second century C.E. The Gospel of John was written about 98 C.E., so this copy was likely made just a few decades later. The text of this fragment agrees very closely with later more complete Greek manuscripts that form the basis for modern translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</p>
