<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">When the apostle Paul wrote to Christians in Ephesus about unity in the congregation, he compared the Mosaic Law to a wall that divided Jews and Gentiles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:14-49:2:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph 2:14</a>) Paul may have been alluding to the wall that surrounded the inner courtyards of the first-century temple in Jerusalem. This low wall, called the Soreg, marked the boundary that Gentiles could not cross on pain of death. On one occasion, Paul was mobbed in the temple because the Jews wrongly accused him of bringing Gentiles into the area fenced off by this wall. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:26-44:21:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 21:26-31</a>) To understand what Paul may have had in mind when he wrote about “the wall in between,” watch this video.</p>
