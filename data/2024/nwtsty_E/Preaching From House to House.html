<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In the days following Pentecost 33 C.E., Jesus’ disciples continued bringing the good news right to the homes of the people. Though the disciples were ordered to “stop speaking,” the inspired record says that “every day in the temple and <em>from house to house</em> they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 5:40-42</a>) About 56 C.E., the apostle Paul told the elders of Ephesus: “I did not hold back from . . . teaching you publicly and <em>from house to house.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 20:20</a>) Paul was speaking of his efforts to preach to these men when they were yet unbelievers and needed to know “about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:21-44:20:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 20:21</a>) When he found spiritually inclined people, he doubtless returned to their homes to teach them further and, as these became believers, to strengthen them in the faith.—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/5:42$p/E:1001070694/29-29:1456">study notes on Ac 5:42;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/20:20$p/E:1001070709/18-18:1157"> 20:20</a>.</p>
