<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Slavery was part of everyday life in the Roman Empire. Roman law regulated certain aspects of the relationship between slaves and their masters. Slaves performed much of the work in the homes of wealthy families occupying the territories of the Roman Empire. Slaves cooked, cleaned, and cared for children. Other slaves worked in factories, in mines, or on farms. Those who were better educated served as doctors, teachers, or secretaries. In fact, slaves worked at every occupation except in the military. In some cases, slaves could be emancipated. (See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="157" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077113/">Freeman; Freedman</a>.”) First-century Christians did not take a stand against governmental authority in this matter, nor did they advocate that slaves revolt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:21-46:7:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Co 7:21</a>) Christians respected the legal right of others, including fellow Christians, to own slaves. That is why the apostle Paul sent the slave Onesimus back to his master, Philemon. Because Onesimus had become a Christian, he willingly returned to his master, subjecting himself as a slave to a fellow Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:10-57:1:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phm 10-17</a>) Paul encouraged slaves to work honestly and diligently.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:9-56:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Tit 2:9, 10</a>.</p>
