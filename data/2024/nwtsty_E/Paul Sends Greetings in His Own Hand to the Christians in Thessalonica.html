Apparently, some Christians there believed that Jehovah’s day was imminent. Perhaps this idea originated from a letter, supposedly from Paul, that was circulating in the Thessalonian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:1-53:2:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Th 2:1, 2</a>) But Paul warned the brothers that such an idea was wrong. To confirm that he was the author of this letter, Paul included a greeting in his own hand.</p>
