Christians Preach on a Street in Ephesus




The street in ancient Ephesus that led from the city’s large theater to its busy harbor was spacious and lined with colonnades. Ephesus was a crossroads of the ancient world. On this street, Christians could preach “the good news of peace” to people of all sorts. (Eph 6:15) The apostle Paul, who wrote the letter to the Ephesians, was familiar with Ephesus; he had preached there for some three years. (Ac 20:17, 18, 31) As a result of Paul’s ministry in Ephesus, “all those living in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.” (Ac 19:10) This fruitful territory yielded a vibrant congregation that continued to grow.​—Ac 19:20.
