Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians




Shown here is a page from a papyrus codex referred to as P46, believed to date from about the year 200 C.E. A total of 86 leaves of this codex have survived. They contain nine of Paul’s inspired letters in the following order: Romans, Hebrews, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians. Highlighted is the title, which reads “Toward [or, “To”] Corinthians 2.” This papyrus collection provides evidence that from an early date, scribes identified Bible books by titles.​—See Media Gallery, “Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians.”
