<p id="p4" data-pid="4">REASON(S): In this quote from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1</a>, the original Hebrew text uses the divine name only once, in the expression “the arm of Jehovah.” John, however, under divine inspiration quotes from the <em>Septuagint</em> translation of Isaiah’s prophecy, where the Greek text begins with the form of the word <em>Kyʹri·os</em> (Lord) used for direct address. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:16-45:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 10:16</a>, where <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1</a> is also quoted.) The translators of the <em>Septuagint</em> may have inserted the divine name in this first occurrence in order to clarify that the prophet addresses his questions to God. Since <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in later copies of the <em>Septuagint</em> is often used as a substitute for the Tetragrammaton in the original Hebrew text (as is the case in the second occurrence of <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in this quote), the divine name has been used here in the main text.​—See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:38-43:12:38" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 12:38b</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7">  <em>The Interpretation of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans,</em> by R.C.H. Lenski, says of the same quotation from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:1</a> that is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:16-45:10:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 10:16</a>: “Paul adds ‘Lord’ to the quotation since the prophet’s question was addressed to <em>Yahweh.”</em></p>

<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9">  The <em>Complete Jewish Bible,</em> by David H. Stern, 1998, uses capital and small capitals for the word “A<span class="altsize">DONAI</span>” twice in this verse. In the introduction to this Bible, the translator explains: “The word <em>‘A<span class="altsize">DONAI</span>’</em> is used . . . wherever I, as the translator, believe <em>‘kurios’</em> is the Greek representation of the tetragrammaton.”</p>

<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10">  <em>The Companion Bible,</em> with notes by E. W. Bullinger, 1999 printing, uses capital and small capitals for L<span class="altsize">ORD</span> twice in the main text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:38-43:12:38" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 12:38</a> to show that both occurrences refer to Jehovah. In Appendix 98, “Divine Names and Titles in New Testament,” on p. 142, it lists <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:38-43:12:38" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 12:38</a> twice under the heading “LORD . . .

<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12">  The <em>NLT Study Bible,</em> Second Edition, 2008, puts “L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>” in capital and small capitals in both occurrences at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:38-43:12:38" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 12:38</a>. The translation committee for this Bible makes this comment in the “Introduction to the New Living Translation”: “We have generally rendered the tetragrammaton (<em>YHWH</em>) consistently as ‘the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>,’ utilizing a form . . . that is common among English translations.” Commenting on the New Testament, the committee says: “The Greek word <em>kurios</em> is consistently translated ‘Lord,’ <em>except that it is translated ‘L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>’ wherever the New Testament text explicitly quotes from the Old Testament, and the text there has it in small capitals.”</em> (Italics ours.)</p>
