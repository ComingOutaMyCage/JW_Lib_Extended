Additionally, Mary Magdalene was among the first disciples who saw the resurrected Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:16-43:20:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Joh 20:16</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/28:7$p/E:1001070628/10-10:386">study note on Mt 28:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>Joanna:</strong> This is a shortened feminine form of the Hebrew name Jehohanan, meaning “Jehovah Has Shown Favor; Jehovah Has Been Gracious.” Joanna, who had been healed by Jesus, was the wife of Chuza, one of Herod Antipas’ officials. She is mentioned only twice in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> and only in Luke’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> account.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:2-42:8:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lu 8:2, 3</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>interpreted:</strong> The Greek word <em>di·er·me·neuʹo</em> can be used in the sense “to translate from one language to another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ac 9:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:30-46:12:30" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1Co 12:30</a>, ftn.) However, it also signifies “to clarify the meaning; to explain fully.” In this verse, it refers to interpreting the meaning of prophecies.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>24:32</strong></a></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>burning:</strong> The expression is rendered from a Greek word that is here used <a class="xt" data-xtid="54" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077378/">metaphorically</a> to describe strong emotions, such as joy and pleasure, and includes the idea of intense interest and enthusiasm. Here it describes the reaction of the two disciples when Jesus was <strong>fully opening up,</strong> or carefully explaining, the inspired Hebrew Scriptures to them.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>within us:</strong> Some early <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> do not include these words, but they are included in other early authoritative manuscripts.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070203/12-14">App. A3</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>fully opening up the Scriptures:</strong> The Greek verb for “to open up fully” (<em>di·a·noiʹgo</em>) is used three times in this chapter. First, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:31-42:24:31" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lu 24:31</a>, it describes how the “eyes” of the two disciples “were fully opened,” allowing them to perceive that they were talking with Jesus. Second, here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Lu 24:32</a>, the word is used in the sense of “clearly explaining.” And third, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:45-42:24:45" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Lu 24:45</a>, this Greek word is used to describe how Jesus “opened up” the minds of the disciples so that they could grasp the meaning of the inspired Hebrew Scriptures.​—See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:56-44:7:56" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ac 7:56</a>, “opened up”; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">16:14</a>, “opened . . . wide”; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:3-44:17:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">17:3</a>, “explaining [lit., “opening up thoroughly”],” where the same Greek word is used.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5"><strong>a spirit:</strong> Although the Greek word <em>pneuʹma</em> can refer to invisible spirit persons, here the term evidently refers to an apparition or a vision. Jesus showed the disciples his hands and feet and told them: “Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you see that I have.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:39-42:24:39" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Lu 24:39</a>) This was to prove that like angels in the past, he had materialized in order to be seen by the disciples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:1-1:18:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ge 18:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:1-1:19:3" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 19:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="s5"><strong>my hands and my feet:</strong> As in Jesus’ case, nailing the hands (and likely the feet also) of the accused to a stake was customary among the Romans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:16-19:22:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps 22:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:25-43:20:25" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Joh 20:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:27-43:20:27" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:14-51:2:14" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> Col 2:14</a>) Some scholars believe that a nail or nails pierced Jesus’ feet, fixing them directly to the stake or to a small platform attached to the stake.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:40-42:24:40" data-bid="32-1" class="b"><strong>24:40</strong></a></p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5"><strong>fish:</strong> Some later <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> add the words “and a honeycomb,” but early authoritative manuscripts do not include these words.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:44" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><strong>24:44</strong></a></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="s5"><strong>in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms:</strong> Jesus was here evidently grouping the entire inspired Hebrew Scriptures in the way adopted by the Jews and known to them. “The Law” (Hebrew, <em>Toh·rahʹ</em>) refers to the Bible books of Genesis through Deuteronomy. “The Prophets” (Hebrew, <em>Nevi·ʼimʹ</em>) refers to the prophetic books of the Hebrew Scriptures, including the so-called Former Prophets (the Bible books of Joshua through Kings). “Psalms” refers to the third section, which contains the remaining books of the Hebrew Scriptures and is called the Writings, or in Hebrew, <em>Kethu·vimʹ.</em> The designation “Psalms” is used because it was the first book of the third section. The term “Tanakh,” a Jewish designation for the Hebrew Scriptures, comes from combining the first letter of each of these three sections (<em>TaNaKh</em>). Jesus’ use of these three terms indicates that the <a class="xt" data-xtid="94" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077360/">canon</a> of the Hebrew Scriptures was well-established when he was on earth and was approved by him.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:48-42:24:48" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><strong>24:48</strong></a></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>You are to be witnesses:</strong> This is one of the first times that Jesus tells his disciples “to be witnesses” about his life and ministry, including his death and resurrection. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:27-43:15:27" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Joh 15:27</a>.) As faithful Jews, Jesus’ disciples were already witnesses of Jehovah and testified that He is the only true God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isa 43:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:8-23:44:8" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 44:8</a>) Some 40 days after the events recorded here, Jesus repeats and further emphasizes their new assignment to be his witnesses.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/1:8$p/E:1001070690/15-15:1243">study note on Ac 1:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="s5"><strong>what my Father promised:</strong> That is, the holy spirit promised at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:28-29:2:29" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Joe 2:28, 29</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Joh 14:16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26</a>. This active force would energize Jesus’ disciples to serve as witnesses in all the earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:4-44:1:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ac 1:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:33-44:2:33" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 2:33</a>.</p>

So there is a time lapse between the events that took place on Jesus’ resurrection day (Nisan 16), as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:1-42:24:49" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Lu 24:1-49</a>, and the events that occurred on the day of his ascension (Iyyar 25), which are described from this verse to the end of the chapter.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070214/">App. A7</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="s5"><strong>Bethany:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/21:17$p/E:1001070621/33-33:334">study note on Mt 21:17</a>.</p>

Also, Luke indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:1-44:1:2" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ac 1:1, 2</a> that in his “first account,” namely, his <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>, he had discussed what Jesus had done in his life and ministry “until the day that he [Jesus] was taken up.” So it is quite appropriate that in his inspired account, Luke would have included these words about Jesus’ ascension to heaven.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:52-42:24:52" data-bid="47-1" class="b"><strong>24:52</strong></a></p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="s5"><strong>did obeisance to him:</strong> Or “bowed down to him; prostrated themselves to him; paid him homage.” When the Greek verb <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> is used to refer to the worship of a god or a deity, it is rendered “to worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Mt 4:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:8-42:4:8" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Lu 4:8</a>) In this context, however, the disciples recognized the resurrected Jesus as God’s representative. They rendered obeisance to him, not as to God or a deity, but as to “God’s Son,” the foretold “Son of man,” the Messiah with divine authority.
