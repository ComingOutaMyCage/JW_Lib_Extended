<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Paul is imprisoned in Rome a second time. He knows that his death is imminent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:6-55:4:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ti 4:6</a>) To add to his concerns, some of his associates, including Demas, have abandoned him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:15-55:1:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ti 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:10-55:4:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4:10</a>) But Paul has good reason to be happy. Several courageous brothers were not ashamed of supporting him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:21-55:4:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ti 4:21</a>) Onesiphorus, for instance, searched all over Rome in order to find Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:16-55:1:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ti 1:16, 17</a>) In spite of his prison chains, Paul remains unconquered. He focuses on the reward that is reserved for him in Christ’s “heavenly Kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:8-55:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Ti 4:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:18-55:4:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Even during this difficult time, Paul thinks, not of himself, but of others. From prison he writes his second inspired letter to Timothy, encouraging him to continue to be faithful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:7-55:1:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2Ti 1:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:3-55:2:3" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>.</p>
