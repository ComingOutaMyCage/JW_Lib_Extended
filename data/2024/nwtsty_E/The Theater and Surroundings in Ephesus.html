Located at the intersection of two of the principal thoroughfares in Ephesus, the theater was a prominent part of life in that city. Roman theaters were used not only for theatrical performances but also for hosting debates. It was into this theater that a mob dragged Paul’s traveling companions when the silversmith Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen stirred up a riot against Paul.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:23-44:19:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 19:23-29</a>.</p>
