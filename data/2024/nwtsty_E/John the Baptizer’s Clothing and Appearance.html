<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">John wore a garment that was woven from camel’s hair and was secured at the waist by a leather belt, or girdle, that could be used to carry small items. Similar clothing was worn by the prophet Elijah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:1:8-12:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 1:8</a>) Camel’s haircloth was a rough fabric commonly worn by the poor. By contrast, soft garments made of silk or linen were worn by the rich. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:7-40:11:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 11:​7-9</a>) Because John was a Nazirite from birth, it is possible that his hair had never been cut. His dress and appearance likely made it immediately apparent that he lived a simple life, completely devoted to doing God’s will.</p>
