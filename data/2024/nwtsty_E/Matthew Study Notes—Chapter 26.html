<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Passover:</strong> This festival (Greek <em>paʹskha</em> from Hebrew <em>peʹsach</em> from the verb <em>pa·sachʹ,</em> meaning “to pass over; to pass by”) was instituted the evening preceding the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt. It commemorates the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt and the ‘passing over’ of their firstborn when Jehovah destroyed the firstborn of Egypt.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:14-2:12:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 12:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:24-2:12:47" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 24-47</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="98" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077221/">Glossary</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>high priest:</strong> When Israel functioned as an independent nation, the high priest held his office for life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:25-4:35:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nu 35:25</a>) However, during the Roman occupation of Israel, the rulers assigned by Rome had authority to appoint and to depose the high priest.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="99" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077136/">Glossary</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>Caiaphas:</strong> This high priest, appointed by the Romans, was a skillful diplomat who held his office longer than any of his immediate predecessors. He was appointed about 18 C.E. and remained in office until about 36 C.E.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">App. B12</a> for the possible location of Caiaphas’ house.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>While Jesus was in Bethany:</strong> The events described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:6-40:26:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mt 26:6-13</a> evidently took place after sunset when Nisan 9 began. That timing is indicated by the parallel account in John, where Jesus is said to <em>arrive</em> at Bethany “six days before the Passover.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:1-43:12:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Joh 12:1</a>) He must have arrived about the beginning (at sunset) of the Sabbath on Nisan 8, which was the day before the meal at Simon’s place.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:2-43:12:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joh 12:2-11</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070213/">App. A7</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">B12</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>costly perfumed oil:</strong> Mark and John’s accounts specify that it was a pound of “genuine nard,” worth 300 denarii. That sum represented about a year’s wages for an ordinary laborer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:3-41:14:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mr 14:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:3-43:12:5" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Joh 12:3-5</a>) The source of such perfumed oil is generally thought to be an aromatic plant (<em>Nardostachys jatamansi</em>) found in the Himalayas. Nard was often adulterated, even counterfeited, but both Mark and John say that this oil was “genuine.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>pouring it on his head:</strong> According to Matthew and Mark, the woman poured the oil on Jesus’ head. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:3-41:14:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mr 14:3</a>) John, who wrote years later, supplied the added detail that she also poured it on his feet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:3-43:12:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joh 12:3</a>) Jesus explains that this loving act was figuratively to prepare him for burial.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:12$p/E:1001070626/27-27:296">study note on Mt 26:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>the disciples:</strong> Only in John’s account is Judas Iscariot identified as the one objecting to Mary’s use of expensive oil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:4-43:12:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joh 12:4-7</a>) Evidently, other apostles merely agreed to what seemed to be a valid point.</p>

He explained that she was unknowingly preparing his body for <strong>burial,</strong> since such perfumed oil and ointments were often applied to dead bodies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:14-14:16:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2Ch 16:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>30 silver pieces:</strong> Matthew is the only <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> writer to mention the amount for which Jesus was betrayed. These were possibly 30 silver shekels minted in Tyre. This sum appears to show the chief priests’ contempt for Jesus, since under the Law, it was the price of a slave. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:32-2:21:32" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ex 21:32</a>) Likewise, when Zechariah asked for his wages from unfaithful Israelites for his prophetic work among God’s people, they weighed out to him “30 pieces of silver,” suggesting that they considered him to be worth no more than a slave.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:13" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Zec 11:12, 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s5"><strong>On the first day of the Unleavened Bread:</strong> The Festival of Unleavened Bread began on Nisan 15, the day after the Passover (Nisan 14), and lasted for seven days. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">App. B15</a>.) In Jesus’ time, however, the Passover had become so closely connected to this festival that all eight days, including Nisan 14, sometimes were referred to as “the Festival of the Unleavened Bread.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:1-42:22:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Lu 22:1</a>) In this context, the phrase “On the first day of” could be rendered “On the day before.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:15-43:1:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Joh 1:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:30-43:1:30" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 30</a>, where the Greek word for “first” [<em>proʹtos</em>] is rendered “before” in a similar construction, namely, “he existed before [<em>proʹtos</em>] me.”) So the original Greek, as well as Jewish custom, allows for the disciples’ question to have been asked of Jesus on Nisan 13. During the daytime of Nisan 13, the disciples made preparations for the Passover, which was later celebrated “after evening had fallen” at the beginning of Nisan 14.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:16-41:14:17" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Mr 14:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="s5"><strong>dips his hand with me:</strong> People usually ate food with their fingers, or they used a piece of bread somewhat like a spoon. This expression could also be an <a class="xt" data-xtid="48" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077368/">idiom</a> meaning “to share food together.” Eating with a person signified close fellowship. To turn against such an intimate companion was considered the vilest form of treachery.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:9-19:41:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:18-43:13:18" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Joh 13:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5"><strong>bowl:</strong> The Greek word denotes a relatively deep bowl from which a meal was eaten.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="s5"><strong>You yourself said it:</strong> A Jewish <a class="xt" data-xtid="48" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077368/">idiom</a> here used to affirm the truth of a statement made by a questioner. Jesus was, in effect, saying: “You have said so, and what you say is true.” Jesus’ reply evidently pointed out that Judas’ own words were an admission of responsibility for Jesus’ betrayal. At some point after this, <strong>Judas</strong> must have left the room before Jesus instituted the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, as shown by a comparison with the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:21-43:13:30" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Joh 13:21-30</a>. Here in Matthew’s account, Judas is next mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:47-40:26:47" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mt 26:47</a>, together with the crowd in the garden of Gethsemane.</p>

There was no spiritual significance to Jesus’ breaking the bread; this was the normal way to divide that type of loaf.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/14:19$p/E:1001070614/25-25:182">study note on Mt 14:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="s5"><strong>saying a blessing:</strong> This expression evidently refers to a prayer offering praise and thanks to God.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="s5"><strong>means:</strong> The Greek word <em>e·stinʹ</em> (literally meaning “is”) here has the sense of “signifies; symbolizes; stands for; represents.” This meaning was evident to the apostles, since on this occasion Jesus’ perfect body was there in front of them and so was the unleavened bread that they were about to eat. Therefore, the bread could not have been his literal body. It is worth noting that the same Greek word is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:7-40:12:7" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Mt 12:7</a>, and many Bible translations render it “means.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:10-58:8:10" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Heb 8:10</a>) Jesus here uses the same expression Moses used when acting as mediator and inaugurating the Law covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai.

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="s5"><strong>after singing praises:</strong> Or “after singing hymns (psalms).” According to one Jewish tradition, the first Hallel Psalms (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:114:8" data-bid="50-1" class="b">113, 114</a>) were sung, or recited, during the Passover meal; the last four (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:1-19:118:29" data-bid="51-1" class="b">115-118</a>) at its conclusion. The latter contain some of the prophecies that apply to the Messiah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:1-19:118:29" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps 118</a> begins and ends with the words: “Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:1-19:118:1" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ps 118:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:29-19:118:29" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 29</a>) These may well have been the last words of praise that Jesus sang with his faithful apostles on the night before his death.</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="s5"><strong>Gethsemane:</strong> This garden was evidently located on the Mount of Olives across the Kidron Valley from Jerusalem. It was probably equipped with an olive press, since its name is derived from a Hebrew or Aramaic expression (<em>gath shema·nehʹ</em>) meaning “oil press.” Although the exact location cannot be determined, one tradition identifies Gethsemane with a garden located at the foot of the Mount of Olives, at the fork of the road on its W slope.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">App. B12</a>.</p>

<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="s5"><strong>I am:</strong> Or “My soul is.” The Greek word <em>psy·kheʹ,</em> traditionally rendered “soul,” here refers to a person’s entire being.

<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="s5"><strong>keep on the watch:</strong> Lit., “stay awake.” Jesus had emphasized the need for his disciples to stay awake spiritually because of not knowing the day and hour of his coming.

<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="s5"><strong>fell facedown:</strong> Or “threw himself down with his face to the ground,” perhaps resting on his hands or elbows. In the Bible, several postures for prayer are mentioned, including standing and kneeling. However, a person in fervent prayer might actually lie facedown with his body outstretched.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="s5"><strong>let this cup pass away:</strong> In the Bible, “cup” is often used figuratively of God’s will, or the “assigned portion,” for a person.
