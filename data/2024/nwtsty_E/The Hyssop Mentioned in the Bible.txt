The Hyssop Mentioned in the Bible




The Hebrew and Greek terms translated “hyssop” in many Bible translations (Hebrew ʼe·zohvʹ and Greek hysʹso·pos) may embrace several different kinds of plants. Shown here is marjoram (Origanum maru; Origanum syriacum), the plant that many scholars think is referred to by the Hebrew term. This plant of the mint family is common in the Middle East. Under favorable conditions, it attains a height of 0.5 to 0.9 m (1.5 to 3 ft). In the Bible, this hyssop is often associated with cleanness. (Ex 12:21, 22; Le 14:2-7; Nu 19:6, 9, 18; Ps 51:7) In the Christian Greek Scriptures, “hyssop” is mentioned only twice. Heb 9:19 describes the inauguration of the old covenant, and in that context, “hyssop” evidently refers to the plant mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. At Joh 19:29, Jesus is said to have been given a sponge full of sour wine “on a hyssop stalk” held up to his mouth. Scholars have different opinions about which plant the Greek word hysʹso·pos refers to in this context. Some think that because marjoram might not have been long enough to carry the sponge to Jesus’ mouth, the term here refers to another plant with a longer stalk, perhaps durra, a variety of common sorghum (Sorghum vulgare). Others think that even in this case, hyssop may have been marjoram. They suggest that a bunch of marjoram may have been attached to the “reed” mentioned by Matthew and Mark.—Mt 27:48; Mr 15:36.
