Papyrus Fragment Containing Parts of Paul’s Letter to Titus




Shown here is a small papyrus fragment called P32. It contains Tit 1:11-15 on one side and Tit 2:3-8 on the other side. This codex leaf is commonly dated to about 200 C.E. It is housed at the John Rylands University Library in Manchester, England. The text of this fragment agrees very closely with the authoritative Greek manuscript Codex Sinaiticus, which was produced about 150 years later.​—See Glossary, “Codex Sinaiticus.”
