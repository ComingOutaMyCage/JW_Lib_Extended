Some were small enough to be turned by hand, but others were so huge that they had to be turned by an animal. It may have been a large millstone similar to this one that Samson was forced to turn for the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:21-7:16:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 16:21</a>) The animal-powered mill was common not only in Israel but also throughout much of the Roman Empire.</p>
