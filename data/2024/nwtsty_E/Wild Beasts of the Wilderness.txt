Wild Beasts of the Wilderness




Among the animals inhabiting the wilderness in which Jesus spent some 40 days and nights were the lion (1), the leopard (2), and the striped hyena (3). Lions have not been found in this area for hundreds of years, but leopards and hyenas continue to inhabit the region. In recent years, though, they have rarely been seen.
