Such coins commemorating the capture of Judea were first minted in 71 C.E. One side of the coin contains an image of Titus, the son of Emperor Vespasian. Titus completed the conquest of Judea that Vespasian had begun. The other side shows a palm tree flanked by a captive Judean male with his hands tied behind his back and a seated Jewish woman in mourning. The inscription reads “IVDAEA CAPTA,” meaning “Captive Judea.”</p>
