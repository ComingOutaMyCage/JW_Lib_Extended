Jesus Calms the Storm




A fierce windstorm batters the boat, and the disciples get soaked as they cross the Sea of Galilee. The men are terrified that they will drown, and they cry for help. Jesus, who is sleeping, wakes up and commands the sea: “Hush! Be quiet!” Immediately, the storm abated, and “a great calm set in.” (Mr 4:35-41) This miracle indicates that when Jesus rules the earth, he and his Father will never allow severe weather to harm subjects of God’s Kingdom. (Re 21:4) Mark is not present on this occasion, but he still records the event in the action-packed and fast-moving style of writing that is characteristic of his Gospel. The vivid description and the details mentioned in this account may indicate that he obtained the information from someone who was onboard, possibly Peter.
