<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>holy brothers:</strong> For the first time in this letter, the apostle Paul addresses the Hebrew Christians directly, using the unique designation “holy brothers.” The early Christians often referred to fellow believers as “brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:19-58:10:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb 10:19</a>) In writing, they also referred to other Christians as “the holy ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:24-58:13:24" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 13:24</a>) Here Paul combines those expressions. He and his fellow Christians were brothers because they belonged to the same spiritual family. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/1:13$p/E:1001070718/33-33:588">study note on Ro 1:13</a>.) They were holy in the sense that they had been sanctified and set apart for God and his service.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/1:7$p/E:1001070718/22-22:1138">study note on Ro 1:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>partakers of the heavenly calling:</strong> The calling, or invitation, that spirit-anointed Christians had received from God gave them the prospect of ruling with Christ in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:17-45:8:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ro 8:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:30-45:8:30" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:26-46:1:26" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1Co 1:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:30-46:1:30" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Re 5:9, 10</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070155/1:20$p/E:1001070779/43-43:578">study note on Col 1:20</a>.) The Mosaic Law pointed forward to this hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:5-2:19:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 19:5, 6</a>) However, fulfilling this “promise of the everlasting inheritance” in heaven was made possible only by the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb 9:14, 15</a> and study note) It was an undeserved kindness from God. Only those who exercised faith in Jesus had that heavenly hope.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070154/3:14$p/E:1001070777/34-34:586">study notes on Php 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070159/1:9$p/E:1001070797/36-36:441"> 2Ti 1:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>consider:</strong> The Greek verb here rendered “consider” conveys the idea “to think about very carefully.” Paul is urging the Hebrew Christians to reflect on and consider closely the role that Jesus played as “the apostle and high priest.” The more fully those Christians understood that role, the more determined they would be to remain faithful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:6-58:3:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb 3:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>the apostle:</strong> An apostle is a person who has been sent to represent someone. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/13:16$p/E:1001070681/20-20:445">study note on Joh 13:16</a>; Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="138" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077020/">Apostle</a>.”) Jesus could be called an apostle because God sent him to the earth as His representative. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:17-43:3:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joh 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:57-43:6:57" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6:57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:29-43:7:29" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 7:29</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/7:29$p/E:1001070675/22-22:252">study note;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:14-62:4:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Jo 4:14</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:2-58:3:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb 3:2-6</a>, Paul goes on to show ways in which Jesus was superior to Moses, who could also be considered an apostle because he was sent as God’s representative to Pharaoh.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:10-2:3:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:28-2:4:28" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 4:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:16-2:7:16" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 7:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>acknowledge:</strong> Or “confess.” To acknowledge Jesus, a person has to express publicly his allegiance to and faith in Jesus. (At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:14-58:4:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb 4:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:23" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 10:23</a>, the same Greek word is rendered “public declaration.”) In this context, Paul highlights the need for Christians to recognize Jesus’ role as a superior, permanent, and sympathetic High Priest.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:14-58:4:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 4:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:24-58:7:24" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 7:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:27-58:7:27" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:2-58:3:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>3:2</strong></a></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>just as Moses:</strong> To remind the Hebrew Christians of the superiority of Christianity over Judaism, Paul here begins comparing Jesus with Moses. Paul shows that Christ was far greater than that imperfect man in whom the Jews put their hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:45-43:5:45" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Joh 5:45</a>) Moses was appointed as an attendant in <strong>the house of that One,</strong> Jehovah God. In this context, God’s house does not refer to the tabernacle or the temple. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:6:18-14:6:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2Ch 6:18</a>.) “The house” that Paul here refers to is the earthly nation, or the congregation, of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:38-2:40:38" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ex 40:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:7-4:12:7" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Nu 12:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:6-40:10:6" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Mt 10:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:24-40:15:24" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 15:24</a>) Moses proved to be faithful as an attendant managing that household. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:2-46:4:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1Co 4:2</a>) Jesus likewise proved to be faithful. But Paul goes on to explain why Jesus’ appointment and his role were greater than those of Moses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:3-58:3:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb 3:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:5-58:3:6" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:3-58:3:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>3:3</strong></a></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>he is counted worthy of more glory than Moses:</strong> Paul here shows why “he,” that is, Jesus, was worthy of more glory, or honor, than Moses was. Moses served as an attendant in a house, or congregation, that God built. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:38-2:40:38" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex 40:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> De 7:6</a>) Jesus, however, was appointed over a house​—the Christian congregation​—that he himself built under God’s direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:35-40:9:35" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 9:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:18-40:16:18" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 16:18</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/16:18$p/E:1001070616/31-31:901">study note;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:13-42:6:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Lu 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:2" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ac 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:33-44:2:33" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> Eph 2:20</a>) Paul’s argument takes in an even more impressive fact: The Son already had a long record of building under his Father’s direction. Paul goes on to show that God “constructed all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb 3:4</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/3:4$p/E:1001070807/15-15:523">study note</a>) As God’s coworker, Jesus was unquestionably worthy of far more glory than Moses was.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>3:4</strong></a></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>Of course, every house is constructed by someone:</strong> Paul here cites a universal truth, using a line of reasoning that was known even in his day: Every house​—whether a material one or the spiritual one discussed in this context​—has to be built by someone. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/3:2$p/E:1001070807/10-10:777">study notes on Heb 3:2,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/3:3$p/E:1001070807/12-12:712"> 3</a>.) The verb here rendered “constructed” can also refer to preparing something for use, such as furnishing the tabernacle.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:2-58:9:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb 9:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:6-58:9:6" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>the one who constructed all things is God:</strong> Jehovah constructed “all things”​—including the whole physical universe, all living creatures, and “a new creation,” namely, the congregation of spirit-anointed Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:15-48:6:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ga 6:15</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070152/6:15$p/E:1001070768/36-36:431">study note</a>) The Greek term for “constructed” is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:28-23:40:28" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa 40:28</a> in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> to translate the Hebrew term for “the Creator.” As God’s master worker, Jesus assisted his Father in all these creative works.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Pr 8:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Col 1:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:10-58:1:10" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Heb 1:10</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/1:10$p/E:1001070805/37-37:824">study note</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/3:3$p/E:1001070807/12-12:712">study note on Heb 3:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>the house:</strong> This is a reference to the congregation of earthly Israel.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/3:2$p/E:1001070807/10-10:777">study note on Heb 3:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>a son over God’s house:</strong> Jesus was far more than an attendant <em>in</em> God’s house, as Moses had been. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:7-4:12:7" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Nu 12:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:2-58:3:3" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Heb 3:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:5-58:3:5" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> 5</a>) Jehovah appointed his Son to rule as King <em>“over</em> God’s house”​—a newly formed spiritual nation, “the Israel of God,” made up of anointed Christians. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070152/6:16$p/E:1001070768/39-39:812">study notes on Ga 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070155/1:13$p/E:1001070779/27-27:932"> Col 1:13</a>.) So Jesus had far more glory than did Moses, whom the Jews of Paul’s day regarded as one of the greatest of God’s prophets.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>our freeness of speech:</strong> Or “our boldness; our confidence.” As used in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, the expression rendered “freeness of speech” can refer to speaking up boldly as well as to approaching Jehovah confidently in worship. The Hebrew Christians were surrounded by Jews who adhered to the Mosaic Law’s arrangements for approach to God. The Jews considered their way of worship far superior to the Christian way of worship. So these Christians needed boldness to preach the good news about Jesus as the true Messiah. (Compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/4:13$p/E:1001070693/17-17:420">study notes on Ac 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/28:31$p/E:1001070717/37-37:478"> 28:31</a>.) They also needed to remain confident that through Jesus, they were free to approach Jehovah in worship and in prayer.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070153/3:12$p/E:1001070771/21-21:497">study notes on Eph 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/4:16$p/E:1001070808/46-46:760"> Heb 4:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>just as the holy spirit says:</strong> Here and in the following verses (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:7-58:3:11" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Heb 3:7-11</a>), Paul quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:7-19:95:11" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps 95:7-11</a>, as penned by David (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:7-58:4:7" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Heb 4:7</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/4:7$p/E:1001070808/18-18:561">study note</a>). However, the apostle attributes those words to the holy spirit, which God used to guide David in writing that psalm.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>do not harden your hearts:</strong> The word picture of hardening one’s heart (or neck) was used in the Hebrew Scriptures with reference to individuals who refused to trust in Jehovah and obey him.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing:</strong> The verse quoted here, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:8-19:95:8" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps 95:8</a>, refers to what happened while Israel was in the wilderness. At Rephidim, the Israelites murmured about the lack of water, so Moses named the place Meribah (meaning “Quarreling”) and Massah (meaning “Testing; Trial”).

Instead, “Meribah” and “Massah” are translated with Greek expressions that can respectively be rendered “the occasion of provoking to bitter anger” and “testing.” This wording may suggest that Paul is referring not just to a specific incident but to the entire faithless course of the Israelites during their 40 years of wandering in the wilderness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:13-4:32:13" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Nu 32:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:9-58:3:9" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Heb 3:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>a wicked heart lacking faith:</strong> This expression does not refer to a heart that merely struggles with occasional doubts or suffers from a lack of faith because of ignorance. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="63-1" class="b">1Ti 1:13</a>.) Rather, it points to a heart that deliberately refuses to believe. Paul had in mind the Israelites in the wilderness who refused to put faith in Jehovah even though they had seen many astonishing miracles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:9-58:3:9" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Heb 3:9</a>) Too absorbed in satisfying their own desires, they failed to reflect on Jehovah’s works and eventually opposed his direction by expressing their wish to return to Egypt.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>drawing away:</strong> The Greek verb here rendered “drawing away” (<em>a·phiʹste·mi</em>) has the basic meaning “to stand away from.” It can also be rendered “to withdraw; to fall away from; to renounce.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:9-44:19:9" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ac 19:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 1Ti 4:1</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070158/4:1$p/E:1001070794/5-5:442">study note;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:19-55:2:19" data-bid="68-1" class="b">2Ti 2:19</a>) It is related to a noun rendered “apostasy.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070157/2:3$p/E:1001070789/10-10:618">study note on 2Th 2:3</a>.) “Drawing away” involves deliberate and conscious action.

A person draws away from God by rebelling against him and by willfully withdrawing from his worship. In this context, Paul uses the example of the Israelites to show that recovery from such a wicked course is extremely difficult.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:7-58:3:11" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Heb 3:7-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:16-58:3:19" data-bid="69-2" class="b"> 16-19</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:25-58:10:25" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Heb 10:25</a>) Later, Paul shows that the inspired use of “Today” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:7-19:95:7" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ps 95:7</a> actually refers to God’s rest day, which from a human perspective is very long.
