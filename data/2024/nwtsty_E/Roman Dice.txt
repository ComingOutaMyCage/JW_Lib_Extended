Roman Dice




The dice shown here are from the Roman period and are made of ivory, though dice were also made of such materials as bone or stone. People often cheated when playing dice. So when the apostle Paul warned the Christians in Ephesus against being deceived by men, he used a Greek expression that literally refers to dice playing. (Eph 4:14) Used metaphorically, this expression is accurately rendered “trickery of men.”
