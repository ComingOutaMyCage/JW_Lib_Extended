2 CORINTHIANS
Study Notes​—Chapter 13
13:1
the third time: See study note on 2Co 12:14.
On the testimony of two or three witnesses: Under the Mosaic Law, the rule governing evidence in a case was that “on the testimony” (lit., “at the mouth”) of two witnesses, or even three, a matter was established before the judges. (De 17:6; 19:15) Jesus agreed with that standard. (Mt 18:16; Joh 8:17, 18) The word “mouth” was used as a figure of speech (a metonymy) for what the witnesses said, or their testimony. When discussing his visits to Corinth, Paul quoted De 19:15 and indicated that this principle was followed in the Christian congregation.​—1Ti 5:19.
13:4
was executed on the stake: Or “was fastened on a stake (pole).”​—See study note on Mt 20:19 and Glossary, “Stake”; “Torture stake.”
13:5
Keep testing: Some in Corinth had been challenging Paul, seeking proof that he really represented Christ. (2Co 13:3) Paul points out that they needed to “keep testing” themselves. One lexicon states that the word Paul here uses for “testing” means “to endeavor to discover the nature or character of someth[ing].” They could discover the nature of their own spiritual standing by comparing their daily conduct, attitudes, and decisions with the sacred truths they were taught. Doing such testing would help them to keep proving that they were true Christians. For “proving,” Paul uses a word that could refer to testing whether something is genuine, as one might test metals.
in the faith: As Paul uses it here, the expression “the faith” refers to the body of Christian teachings and beliefs. (Ac 6:7; Ga 6:10; Eph 4:5; Jude 3) It is synonymous with “the truth,” as used at Ga 5:7, 2Pe 2:2, and 2Jo 1. Paul here stresses that it is not enough to know the truths and principles that Jesus taught; a Christian needs to be “in the faith,” that is, to live by those truths.​—2Co 12:20, 21.
13:9
being readjusted: Or “brought into proper alignment.” The Greek term ka·tarʹti·sis, rendered “being readjusted,” appears only here in the Christian Greek Scriptures. This and related terms are used to describe the restoring of something to a proper condition. For instance, at Mt 4:21, the verb ka·tar·tiʹzo is used to describe “mending” nets. At Ga 6:1, the same verb is used of the need to readjust spiritually a fellow believer who has taken a false step. The related noun ka·tar·ti·smosʹ, rendered “readjustment” at Eph 4:12, was a term sometimes used in medical texts to describe the setting of a bone, a limb, or a joint.
