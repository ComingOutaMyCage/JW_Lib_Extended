<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Herod:</strong> That is, Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great.​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077132/">Glossary</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>district ruler:</strong> Lit., “<a class="xt" data-xtid="74" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077387/">tetrarch</a>” (meaning “ruler over one fourth” of a province), a term applied to a minor district ruler or territorial prince ruling only with the approval of the Roman authorities. The tetrarchy of Herod Antipas consisted of Galilee and Perea.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/6:14$p/E:1001070634/23-23:424">study note on Mr 6:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>arrested John . . . and imprisoned him:</strong> The Bible does not mention where this took place. <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a> says that John was imprisoned and killed at Machaerus fortress, which was located on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> Book 18, chap. 5, par. 2 [Loeb 18.119]) It is possible that John spent some time in that prison. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:12-40:4:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 4:12</a>) However, it is likely that at the time of his death, John was held in Tiberias, a city located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: (1) John seems to have been imprisoned near where Jesus was carrying out his ministry in Galilee. John heard of Jesus’ works, and from jail he sent his disciples to speak with Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:1-40:11:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mt 11:1-3</a>) (2) Mark states that “the most prominent men of Galilee” were in attendance at Herod’s birthday party, indicating that it was held at Herod’s residence in Tiberias. John was evidently in captivity close to where the party took place.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:21-41:6:29" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mr 6:21-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:6-40:14:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mt 14:6-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother:</strong> Herod Antipas became infatuated with Herodias, the wife of his half brother Herod Philip. Herodias divorced Philip, Antipas divorced his wife, and Herodias and Antipas were married. John the Baptist was arrested for criticizing this immoral union, one that was contrary to Jewish law.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>birthday . . . celebrated:</strong> This event likely occurred at Herod Antipas’ residence in Tiberias. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/14:3$p/E:1001070614/10-10:985">study notes on Mt 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/6:21$p/E:1001070634/32-32:648"> Mr 6:21</a>.) The Bible mentions just two birthday celebrations​—the one referred to here, at which John was beheaded; the other, that of a Pharaoh, at which the Egyptian monarch’s chief baker was executed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:40:18-1:40:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ge 40:18-22</a>) These two accounts are similar in that both occasions were marked with great feasting and the granting of favors and both are remembered for executions.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>the king:</strong> Herod Antipas’ official Roman title was “<a class="xt" data-xtid="74" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077387/">tetrarch</a>,” as seen from <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/14:1$p/E:1001070614/5-5:294">study note on Mt 14:1</a>. However, he was popularly referred to as “king.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>his oaths:</strong> The use of the plural “oaths” (in contrast with the singular at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:7-40:14:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 14:7</a>) may indicate that Herod emphasized or confirmed his promise with repeated oaths.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>fish:</strong> In Bible times, fish were commonly prepared by broiling or by salting and drying and were often eaten along with bread. The fish Jesus used were likely salted and dried.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>after breaking the loaves:</strong> Bread was often made in flat loaves that were baked hard. Therefore, breaking the loaves to eat them was customary.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:36-40:15:36" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mt 15:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:26" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 26:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:41-41:6:41" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Mr 6:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:6-41:8:6" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:16-42:9:16" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> Lu 9:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>baskets:</strong> These may have been small wicker baskets with a cord handle that a traveler could use for carrying them. It is thought that they had a volume of approximately 7.5 L (2 gal).​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/16:9$p/E:1001070616/13-13:528">study notes on Mt 16:9,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/16:10$p/E:1001070616/15-15:73"> 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>as well as women and young children:</strong> Only Matthew mentions the women and the young children when reporting this miracle. It is possible that the total number of those miraculously fed was well over 15,000.</p>

The Hebrews formerly divided the night into three watches of about four hours each (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:24-2:14:24" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex 14:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:19-7:7:19" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Jg 7:19</a>), but by this time, they had adopted the Roman system.</p>
