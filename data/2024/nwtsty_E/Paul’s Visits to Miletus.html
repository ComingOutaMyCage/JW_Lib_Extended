<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Highlighted on the map is the ancient city of Miletus on the west coast of Asia Minor (in modern-day Türkiye). The Bible record indicates that Paul visited this city at least twice. The first visit took place toward the end of his third missionary tour (about 56 C.E.). On his way to Jerusalem, he arrived at Miletus by ship and called the elders in the Ephesus congregation to an important meeting. To reach Miletus from Ephesus, the elders traveled by land and also likely by ferry, making a journey of about 70 km (44 mi). After an emotional farewell, Paul was escorted to the ship to continue his journey. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 20:17-38</a>) It seems that Paul again visited Miletus after being released from his first imprisonment in Rome. He wrote that he “left Trophimus sick at Miletus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:20-55:4:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ti 4:20</a>; see the map “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001072166/">Paul’s Journeys After c. 61 C.E.</a>”</p>
