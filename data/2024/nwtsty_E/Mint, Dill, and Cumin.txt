Mint, Dill, and Cumin




From ancient times, mint has been used in medicine and for flavoring food. The Greek word he·dyʹo·smon, “mint,” (literally, sweet-smelling) likely embraced the various known kinds of mint found in Israel and Syria, including the common horsemint (Mentha longifolia). Dill (Anethum graveolens) is cultivated for its aromatic seeds, which are valued as a spice for flavoring foods and as a medicine for treating stomach ailments. The cumin plant (Cuminum cyminum) is of the carrot or parsley family and is best known for its pungently aromatic seeds, used in Middle Eastern and other countries as a spice for flavoring bread, cakes, stews, and even liquors.
