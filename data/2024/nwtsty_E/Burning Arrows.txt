Burning Arrows




The photo (left) shows an arrowhead 19 cm (7.5 in.) long that dates to Roman times. Flammable material would be placed in the enclosure behind the tip. Armies sometimes shot a barrage of burning arrows (as shown in the illustration on the right) over the walls of a besieged city to set it ablaze. Paul wrote that the wicked one shoots “burning arrows” at Christians, who can extinguish them with “the large shield of faith.”​—Eph 6:16.
