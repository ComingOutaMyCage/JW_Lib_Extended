<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Shown here is a page from a papyrus codex known as P<sup>46</sup>, believed to date from about the year 200 C.E. This codex is a collection of nine of Paul’s letters. (See Media Gallery, “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001072207/">Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians</a>” and “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001072216/">Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians</a>.”) This leaf shows the beginning of Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. In addition to being known as P<sup>46</sup>, the leaf is part of what is called Papyrus Michigan Inv. 6238 and is housed at the University of Michigan library, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. Highlighted is the title, which reads “Toward [or, “To”] Ephesians.”</p>
