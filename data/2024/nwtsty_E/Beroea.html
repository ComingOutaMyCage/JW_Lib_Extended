It lay some 30 km (19 mi) south of a famous Roman highway, the Egnatian Way (<em>Via Egnatia</em>), and about 65 km (40 mi) west-southwest of Thessalonica. Both Jews and Greeks in Beroea responded to the good news. However, the local disciples urged Paul to leave the city after troublemakers from Thessalonica arrived and stirred up mob violence. But Silas and Timothy remained in Beroea for a time, strengthening the new congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:10-44:17:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 17:10-14</a>) Beroea was the last city in the fruitful but challenging area of Macedonia that Paul visited during his second missionary tour.</p>
