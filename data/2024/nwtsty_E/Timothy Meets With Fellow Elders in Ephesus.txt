Timothy Meets With Fellow Elders in Ephesus




While serving as an elder in Ephesus, Timothy receives a letter from the apostle Paul. (1Ti 1:3) No doubt both Timothy and his fellow elders benefit greatly from this spirit-inspired letter. In it, Paul lists the qualifications for men who are to serve as elders or ministerial servants in the Christian congregation. (Ac 20:17, 28; 1Ti 3:1-10, 12, 13) He encourages Timothy to “become an example” to fellow believers and to apply himself to public reading, exhortation, and teaching. (1Ti 4:12, 13) Paul also reminds Timothy not to neglect the special gift, or assignment, that “the body of elders” had given him.​—1Ti 4:14.
