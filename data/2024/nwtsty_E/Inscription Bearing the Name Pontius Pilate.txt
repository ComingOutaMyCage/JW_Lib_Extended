Inscription Bearing the Name Pontius Pilate




In 1961, archaeologists working in the ancient Roman theater in Caesarea, Israel, found that a reused stone slab clearly bore Pilateâ€™s name in Latin (replica shown here). His name also appears a number of times in other contemporary historical records.
