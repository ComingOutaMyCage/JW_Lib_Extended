MATTHEW
Study Notes​—Chapter 12

12:1
through the grainfields: Perhaps by means of footpaths that separated one tract of land from another.
Sabbath: See Glossary.
12:2
what is not lawful: Jehovah had commanded that the Israelites do no work on the Sabbath. (Ex 20:8-10) Jewish religious leaders claimed the right to define exactly what constituted work. According to them, Jesus’ disciples were guilty of harvesting (plucking) and threshing (rubbing) grain. (Lu 6:1, 2) However, such a definition overstepped Jehovah’s command.
12:4
house of God: See study note on Mr 2:26.
loaves of presentation: Or “showbread.” The Hebrew expression literally means “bread of the face.” The bread was figuratively before Jehovah as a constant offering to him.​—Ex 25:30; see Glossary and App. B5.
12:5
violate the Sabbath: That is, to treat the Sabbath as any other day. They did so by carrying on butchering and other work in connection with the animal sacrifices.​—Nu 28:9, 10.
12:7
what this means: Lit., “what is.” Here the Greek word e·stinʹ (literally meaning “is”) has the sense of “signifies; means.”​—See study note on Mt 26:26.
mercy and not sacrifice: See study note on Mt 9:13.
12:8
Son of man: See study note on Mt 8:20.
Lord of the Sabbath: Jesus applies this expression to himself (Mr 2:28; Lu 6:5), indicating that the Sabbath was at his disposal for doing the work commanded by his heavenly Father. (Compare Joh 5:19; 10:37, 38.) On the Sabbath, Jesus performed some of his most outstanding miracles, which included healing the sick. (Lu 13:10-13; Joh 5:5-9; 9:1-14) This evidently foreshadowed the kind of relief he will bring during his Kingdom rule, which will be like a sabbath rest.​—Heb 10:1.
12:10
hand: The Greek word rendered “hand” is broad in meaning and can refer to a person’s arm, hand, and fingers.​—See also Mt 12:13.
12:12
How much more: See study note on Mt 7:11.
12:16
not to make him known: See study note on Mr 3:12.
12:17
to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: See study note on Mt 1:22.
12:18
Look!: See study note on Mt 1:20.
I have: Or “my soul has.” In this quote from Isa 42:1, the Greek word psy·kheʹ is used to render the Hebrew word neʹphesh, both traditionally rendered “soul.”​—See Glossary, “Soul.”
whom I have approved: Or “with whom I am well-pleased.”​—See study note on Mt 3:17.
12:20
smoldering wick: A common household lamp was a small earthenware vessel filled with olive oil. A flax wick drew the oil up to feed the flame. The Greek expression rendered “smoldering wick” may refer to a wick that gives off smoke because an ember is still present but the flame is fading or is extinguished. The prophecy of Isa 42:3 foretold Jesus’ compassion; he would never extinguish the last spark of hope in humble and downtrodden people.
with success: Or “to victory.” The Greek word niʹkos is rendered “victory” at 1Co 15:55, 57.
12:24
Beelzebub: A designation applied to Satan.​—See study note on Mt 10:25.
12:25
house: That is, a household. The original-language term for “house” could refer to an individual family or an extended household, including one associated with the palaces of kings. (Ac 7:10; Php 4:22) The term was used of ruling dynasties, such as those of the Herods and the Caesars, where internal dissension was common and destructive. Here in Matthew’s account, the term “house” is used in parallel with city.
12:26
Satan: See study note on Mt 4:10.
12:27
sons: Here used in the sense of “followers; disciples.”
they: That is, “your sons.”
be your judges: That is, what their sons did refuted the Pharisees’ argument.
12:28
God’s spirit: Or “God’s active force.” In a later, similar conversation, recorded at Lu 11:20, Jesus refers to the expelling of demons “by means of God’s finger.”​—See study note on Lu 11:20.
12:31
blasphemy: Refers to defamatory, injurious, or abusive speech against God or against sacred things. Since holy spirit emanates from God himself, willfully opposing or denying its operation amounted to blasphemy against God. As shown at Mt 12:24, 28, Jewish religious leaders saw God’s spirit at work in Jesus as he performed miracles; yet, they attributed this power to Satan the Devil.
12:32
system of things: The Greek word ai·onʹ, having the basic meaning “age,” can refer to a state of affairs or to features that distinguish a certain period of time, epoch, or age. Jesus is stating that blasphemy against the holy spirit will not be forgiven in the present ungodly system of things under Satan’s rule (2Co 4:4; Eph 2:2; Tit 2:12) nor in the coming system of things under God’s rule, in which “everlasting life” is promised (Lu 18:29, 30).​—See Glossary.
12:34
Offspring of vipers: See study note on Mt 23:33.
12:39
adulterous: Refers to spiritual adultery, or unfaithfulness to God.​—See study note on Mr 8:38.
sign of Jonah: Jonah compared his deliverance from the belly of the fish after about three days to being raised from the Grave. (Jon 1:17–2:2) Jesus’ resurrection from the literal grave was to be just as real as Jonah’s deliverance from the belly of the fish. However, even when Jesus was resurrected after being dead for parts of three days, his hard-hearted critics did not exercise faith in him.
12:40
three days and three nights: Other Bible accounts show that this expression can mean parts of three days and that part of one day can be considered a whole day.​—Ge 42:17, 18; 1Ki 12:5, 12; Mt 27:62-66; 28:1-6.
12:41
look!: See study note on Mt 1:20.
12:42
queen of the south: That is, the queen of Sheba. Her kingdom is thought to have been located in SW Arabia.​—1Ki 10:1.
12:46
brothers: That is, Jesus’ half brothers. Their names are mentioned at Mt 13:55 and Mr 6:3.​—See study note on Mt 13:55 regarding the meaning of the term “brother.”
12:47
So someone . . . to you: This verse is omitted in some ancient manuscripts.
12:49
Look! My mother and my brothers!: Jesus here makes a distinction between his natural brothers, who evidently lacked faith in him (Joh 7:5), and his spiritual brothers, his disciples. He shows that regardless of how precious the ties are that bind him to his relatives, his relationship with those who do “the will of [his] Father” is even more precious.​—Mt 12:50.
