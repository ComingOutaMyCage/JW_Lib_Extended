People often cheated when playing dice. So when the apostle Paul warned the Christians in Ephesus against being deceived by men, he used a Greek expression that literally refers to dice playing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:14-49:4:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph 4:14</a>) Used <a class="xt" data-xtid="54" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077378/">metaphorically</a>, this expression is accurately rendered “trickery of men.”</p>
