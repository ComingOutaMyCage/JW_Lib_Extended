Palm Tree




In Bible times, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) was abundant in Israel and surrounding areas. Palms were said to flourish on the coast of the Sea of Galilee as well as along the lower reaches of the hot Jordan Valley. They were particularly abundant around Jericho, called “the city of the palm trees.” (De 34:3; Jg 1:16; 3:13; 2Ch 28:15) A date palm may reach a height of 30 m (100 ft). Its branches, or fronds, can grow to be from 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) in length. The Jews gathered palm fronds during the joyful Festival of Booths. (Le 23:39-43; Ne 8:14, 15) The use of palm branches by the crowd who hailed Jesus as “the King of Israel” evidently served to symbolize their praise as well as their submission to his royal position. (Joh 12:12, 13) The “great crowd” of Re 7:9, 10 are likewise pictured with “palm branches in their hands,” ascribing salvation to God and to the Lamb.
