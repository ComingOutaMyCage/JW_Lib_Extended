During the Festival of Ingathering, for example, booths were erected on the rooftops. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:41-3:23:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Le 23:41, 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:13-5:16:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 16:13-15</a>) Such chores as the drying of flax were done there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:2:6-6:2:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos 2:6</a>) Sometimes people slept on the roof. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:9:25-9:9:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Sa 9:25, 26</a>) Any activity on a roof would easily be seen by others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:22-10:16:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 16:22</a>) And an announcement made from a rooftop would quickly be heard by neighbors and those passing by on the street.</p>
