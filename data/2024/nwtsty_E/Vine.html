<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">The grapevine (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>) had been cultivated for thousands of years and was commonly seen throughout the area where Jesus lived. If wood was available, the workers made stakes or a trellis to support the vines. During the winter, cultivators pruned the preceding year’s growth from the vines. After shoots grew in the spring, workers pruned any new shoots lacking fruit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:2-43:15:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 15:2</a>) This helped the vine produce more fruit of better quality. Jesus likened his Father to a cultivator, himself to a vine, and his disciples to branches. Just as branches on a literal vine receive their support and nourishment from the trunk, Jesus’ disciples receive spiritual support and nourishment if they remain in union with him, “the true vine.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:1-43:15:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:5-43:15:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>
