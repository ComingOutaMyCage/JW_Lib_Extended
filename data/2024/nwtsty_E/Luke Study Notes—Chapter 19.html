<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Zacchaeus:</strong> From a Hebrew name, possibly from a <a class="xt" data-xtid="87" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077382/">root word</a> meaning “clean; pure.” As <strong>a chief tax collector,</strong> it seems that Zacchaeus was over other tax collectors in and around Jericho. The district around this city was fertile and productive, yielding considerable tax revenue. Zacchaeus <strong>was rich,</strong> and his own words (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:8-42:19:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 19:8</a>) indicate that he used questionable practices to accumulate at least part of his wealth.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>extorted:</strong> Or “extorted by false accusation.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/3:14$p/E:1001070647/29-29:642">study note on Lu 3:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>four times over:</strong> Zacchaeus could likely calculate from his tax records just how much he had received from various Jews, and he vowed to make a fourfold restitution. That is even more than God’s Law required. In such cases of repentance and admission of guilt, the Law ordered that the defrauder pay back the full amount and “add to it a fifth [that is, 20 percent] of its value,” but Zacchaeus said that he would repay four times the amount. As fruitage of his repentance, he thus showed not only love for the poor but also justice toward oppressed ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:6:2-3:6:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 6:2-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:5:7-4:5:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Nu 5:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>illustration:</strong> Or “parable.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/13:3$p/E:1001070613/7-7:399">study note on Mt 13:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>to secure kingly power:</strong> Or “to secure a kingdom.” The Greek word <em>ba·si·leiʹa,</em> most often rendered “kingdom,” has a broad meaning and often refers to a royal government as well as to the territory and peoples under the rule of a king. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:2$p/E:1001070603/10-10:437">study notes on Mt 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/25:34$p/E:1001070625/31-31:335"> 25:34</a>.) It may also signify kingship, the royal office or position of the king, with its accompanying dignity, power, and authority. In the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a person of noble birth to travel to Rome in quest of kingly power. Jesus’ parable may well have reminded his listeners of Archelaus, a son of Herod the Great. Before Herod the Great died, he designated Archelaus as heir to rulership over Judea and other areas. However, to secure the rulership, Archelaus first made the long journey to Rome in order to get the approval of Caesar Augustus.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>minas:</strong> A Greek mina was not a coin but a unit of weight of some 340 g (10.9 oz t) and, according to ancient Greek writers, was reckoned to have a monetary value equal to 100 drachmas. Since the drachma was worth nearly as much as a denarius, a mina was a considerable sum. (See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="84" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077082/">Denarius</a>.”) A Greek mina was different from the Hebrew mina.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="129" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077193/">Mina</a>,” and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070236/">App. B14</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>bank:</strong> In the parable of the minas in Luke’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>, as well as in the illustration about the talents in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus referred to a bank and to bankers who give interest on money deposited with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:14-40:25:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mt 25:14-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:12-42:19:27" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Lu 19:12-27</a>) The Greek word <em>traʹpe·za,</em> here rendered “bank,” literally means “table.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:27-40:15:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mt 15:27</a>) When associated with financial operations, such as the money changers, this word refers to a table or a counter for displaying coins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:12-40:21:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mt 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:15-41:11:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Mr 11:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:15-43:2:15" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Joh 2:15</a>) During the first century C.E., moneylenders, or bankers, were prominent in Israel and surrounding nations.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>interest:</strong> The Law forbade the Israelites to charge interest on loans to needy fellow Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:25-2:22:25" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex 22:25</a>) But interest was specifically allowed on loans to foreigners, likely for business ventures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:20-5:23:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">De 23:20</a>) It seems that in Jesus’ day, it was common to receive interest on funds deposited with moneylenders.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>the stones would cry out:</strong> As the context shows, Jesus was speaking about the particular declaration his disciples were making and to which the Pharisees objected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:37-42:19:39" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Lu 19:37-39</a>) The disciples were using the words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:26-19:118:26" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 118:26</a>. That prophetic psalm was certain to be fulfilled on this occasion, for Jehovah’s words do not return to him “without results.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa 55:11</a>) If the disciples had been forced to be silent at this time, the literal stones would have cried out in order to fulfill this prophecy.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>wept:</strong> The Greek word for “wept” often refers to weeping audibly.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>fortification of pointed stakes:</strong> Or “palisade.” The Greek word <em>khaʹrax</em> occurs only here in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>. It has been defined as a “pointed stick or post used to fence in an area; stake” and also as a “military installation involving the use of stakes; palisade.” Jesus’ words came true in the year 70 C.E. when the Romans, commanded by Titus, erected a siege wall, or palisade, around Jerusalem. Titus’ objective was threefold​—to prevent the Jews from fleeing, to encourage their surrender, and to starve the inhabitants into submission. To provide materials for the construction of this fortification around Jerusalem, Roman troops stripped the countryside of trees.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="s5"><strong>the time of your being inspected:</strong> Or “the appointed time of your inspection.” The Greek word <em>e·pi·sko·peʹ</em> (inspection; visitation) is related to the words <em>e·piʹsko·pos</em> (overseer) and <em>e·pi·sko·peʹo</em> (watch over; watch carefully) and can have a positive or a negative connotation. For unfaithful Jews, who did not discern this time of inspection in connection with Jesus’ earthly ministry, it would result in adverse judgment by God. However, those who did discern this time of inspection and took advantage of it to repent and show faith in God would have God’s approval. The same Greek word is used in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:3-23:10:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa 10:3</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:15-24:10:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jer 10:15</a> to render a Hebrew expression for “day of reckoning (punishment).”</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="s5"><strong>throw out those who were selling:</strong> On Nisan 10, 33 C.E., Jesus cleanses the temple a second time.
