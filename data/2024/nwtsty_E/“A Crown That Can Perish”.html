<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In his first letter to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul wrote about athletes who worked hard “to receive a crown that can perish.” Paul may have been referring to the prize given to athletes who won an event at the Isthmian Games. These games were held near Corinth. When Paul wrote his letter, the crowns were likely made of pine, though at times wild celery was also used. Both types of material perish quickly. This background information helps to explain the contrast between the fleeting glory won by athletes and the lasting glory gained by anointed Christians as corulers with Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:25-46:9:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Co 9:25</a>.</p>
