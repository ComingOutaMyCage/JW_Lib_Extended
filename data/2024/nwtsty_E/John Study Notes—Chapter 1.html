<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>John:</strong> The English equivalent of the Hebrew name Jehohanan or Johanan, meaning “Jehovah Has Shown Favor; Jehovah Has Been Gracious.” The writer of this <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> is not identified by name. However, by the second and third centuries C.E., the book was widely attributed to the apostle John. Whenever the name John is mentioned in this Gospel, it refers to John the Baptist, with the exception of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:42-43:1:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 1:42</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:15-43:21:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">21:15-17</a>, where Jesus referred to the father of Peter as John. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:42$p/E:1001070669/76-76:361">study notes on Joh 1:42</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/21:15$p/E:1001070689/13-13:361">21:15</a>.) Although the apostle John is never mentioned by name, he and his brother James are referred to as “the sons of Zebedee.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:2-43:21:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joh 21:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:21-40:4:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mt 4:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:19-41:1:19" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Mr 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:10-42:5:10" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Lu 5:10</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:6$p/E:1001070669/18-18:651">study note on Joh 1:6</a>.) In the closing verses of the Gospel, the writer refers to himself as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:20-43:21:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 21:20-24</a>), and there are good reasons for linking this expression with the apostle John.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/13:23$p/E:1001070681/25-25:980">study note on Joh 13:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>According to John:</strong> None of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> writers identify themselves as such in their accounts, and titles are apparently not part of the original text. In some <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> of John’s Gospel, the title appears as <em>Eu·ag·geʹli·on Ka·taʹ I·o·anʹnen</em> (“Good News [or, “Gospel”] According to John”), whereas in others a shorter title, <em>Ka·taʹ I·o·anʹnen</em> (“According to John”), is used. It is not clear exactly when such titles were added or began to be used. Some suggest the second century C.E., since examples of the longer title have been found in Gospel manuscripts that have been dated to the end of the second century or early third century. According to some scholars, the opening words of Mark’s Gospel (“The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God”) may have been the reason why the term “gospel” (lit., “good news”) came to be used to describe these accounts. The use of such titles along with the name of the writer may have come about for practical reasons, providing a clear means of identifying the books.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1:1</strong></a></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>the beginning:</strong> In the Scriptures, the meaning of the term “beginning” depends on the context. Here the Greek word <em>ar·kheʹ</em> cannot refer to “the beginning” of God the Creator, for he is eternal, having no beginning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:2-19:90:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 90:2</a>) It must, therefore, refer to the time when God began creating. God’s first creation was termed <strong>the Word,</strong> a heavenly designation of the one who became Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joh 1:14-17</a>) So Jesus is the only one who can rightly be called “the firstborn of all creation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col 1:15</a>) He was “the beginning of the creation by God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Re 3:14</a>), so he existed before other spirit creatures and the physical universe were created. In fact, by means of Jesus, “all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col 1:16</a>; for other examples of how the term “beginning” is used, see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/6:64$p/E:1001070674/56-56:1206">study note on Joh 6:64</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>the Word:</strong> Or “the Logos.” Greek, <em>ho loʹgos.</em> Here used as a title, it is also used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joh 1:14</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:13-66:19:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Re 19:13</a>. John identified the one to whom this title belongs, namely, Jesus. This title was applied to Jesus during his prehuman existence as a spirit creature, during his ministry on earth as a perfect man, and after his exaltation to heaven. Jesus was God’s Word of communication, or Spokesman, for conveying information and instructions to the Creator’s other spirit sons and to humans. So it is reasonable to think that prior to Jesus’ coming to earth, Jehovah on many occasions communicated with mankind through the Word, His angelic mouthpiece.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:7-1:16:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ge 16:7-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:11-1:22:11" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 22:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:11-1:31:11" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 31:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:2-2:3:5" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Ex 3:2-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:1-7:2:4" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> Jg 2:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:11-7:6:12" data-bid="13-6" class="b"> 6:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:3-7:13:3" data-bid="13-7" class="b"> 13:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>with:</strong> Lit., “toward.” In this context, the Greek preposition <em>pros</em> implies close proximity and fellowship. It also indicates separate persons, in this case, the Word and the only true God.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>the Word was a god:</strong> Or “the Word was divine [or, “a godlike one”].” This statement by John describes a quality or characteristic of “the Word” (Greek, <em>ho loʹgos;</em> see study note on <strong>the Word</strong> in this verse), that is, Jesus Christ. The Word’s preeminent position as the firstborn Son of God through whom God created all other things is a basis for describing him as “a god; a godlike one; divine; a divine being.” Many translators favor the rendering “the Word was God,” equating him with God Almighty. However, there are good reasons for saying that John did not mean that “the Word” was the same as Almighty God. First, the preceding clause and the following clause both clearly state that “the Word” was <em>“with</em> God.” Also, the Greek word <em>the·osʹ</em> occurs three times in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">verses 1 and 2</a>. In the first and third occurrences, <em>the·osʹ</em> is preceded by the definite article in Greek; in the second occurrence, there is no article. Many scholars agree that the absence of the definite article before the second <em>the·osʹ</em> is significant. When the article is used in this context, <em>the·osʹ</em> refers to God Almighty. On the other hand, the absence of the article in this grammatical construction makes <em>the·osʹ</em> qualitative in meaning and describes a characteristic of “the Word.” Therefore, a number of Bible translations in English, French, and German render the text in a way similar to the <em>New World Translation,</em> conveying the idea that “the Word” was “a god; divine; a divine being; of divine kind; godlike.” Supporting this view, ancient translations of John’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> into the Sahidic and the Bohairic dialects of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="121" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077371/">Coptic</a> language, probably produced in the third and fourth centuries C.E., handle the first occurrence of <em>the·osʹ</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Joh 1:1</a> differently from the second occurrence. These renderings highlight a <em>quality</em> of “the Word,” that his nature was like that of God, but they do not equate him with his Father, the almighty God. In harmony with this verse, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:9-51:2:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Col 2:9</a> describes Christ as having “all the fullness of the divine quality.” And according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:4-61:1:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2Pe 1:4</a>, even Christ’s joint heirs would “become sharers in divine nature.” Additionally, in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> translation, the Greek word <em>the·osʹ</em> is the usual equivalent of the Hebrew words rendered “God,” <em>ʼel</em> and <em>ʼelo·himʹ,</em> which are thought to convey the basic meaning “Mighty One; Strong One.” These Hebrew words are used with reference to the almighty God, other gods, and humans. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/10:34$p/E:1001070678/32-32:320">study note on Joh 10:34</a>.) Calling the Word “a god,” or “a mighty one,” would be in line with the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa 9:6</a>, foretelling that the Messiah would be called “Mighty God” (not “Almighty God”) and that he would be the “Eternal Father” of all those privileged to live as his subjects. The zeal of his own Father, “Jehovah of armies,” would accomplish this.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:7-23:9:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa 9:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>What has come into existence:</strong> The earliest Greek <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> do not have any punctuation in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">verses 3 and 4</a>. The punctuation used in the <em>New World Translation</em> is according to the scholarly editions of the Greek text published by <a class="xt" data-xtid="105" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077417/">Westcott</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="106" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077373/">Hort</a>, the United Bible Societies, and <a class="xt" data-xtid="104" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077433/">Nestle and Aland</a>. The last part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">verse 3</a> is linked with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:4-43:1:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">verse 4</a>. This rendering indicates that life and light came into existence by means of the Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Col 1:15, 16</a>) Some translations follow another understanding of the Greek text and connect the last part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">verse 3</a> with the preceding words, conveying the idea “and apart from him not even one thing came into existence that has come into existence.” However, many scholars support the reading of the <em>New World Translation.</em></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>him:</strong> That is, the Word, or the Logos.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:1$p/E:1001070669/8-8:710">study note on Joh 1:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>life . . . light:</strong> These two themes are woven into the fabric of John’s inspired account. God is the Source of life, and <strong>by means of</strong> Jesus, the Word, all other forms of life “came into existence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Joh 1:3</a>) In this sense, life came through Jesus Christ. Also by means of Jesus, God made it possible for sinful, dying mankind to gain everlasting life. In that sense, Jesus can be identified as <strong>the life</strong> that became <strong>the light of men.</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:9-43:1:9" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Joh 1:9</a> calls the Word “the true light that gives light to every sort of man.” Humans who follow Jesus, “the light of the world,” will “possess the light of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:12-43:8:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Joh 8:12</a>) The Word is God’s “Chief Agent of life,” enlightening mankind on their way to gain life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:15-44:3:15" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ac 3:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>sent as a representative of God:</strong> Or “commissioned by God.” The mission of John the Baptist came from God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:2-42:3:2" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Lu 3:2</a>) and involved the work of a preacher, or public messenger. John not only announced the approach of the Messiah and of God’s Kingdom to the Jews who came out to him but also encouraged them to repent of their sins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:1-40:3:3" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mt 3:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:12" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:1-41:1:4" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> Mr 1:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:7-42:3:9" data-bid="33-4" class="b"> Lu 3:7-9</a>) John the Baptist served as a prophet, a teacher (with disciples), and an evangelizer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:76-42:1:77" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Lu 1:76, 77;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:18-42:3:18" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 3:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:1-42:11:1" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:35-43:1:35" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> Joh 1:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>John:</strong> That is, John the Baptist. The writer of this <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>, the apostle John, refers to John the Baptist 19 times but, unlike the other Gospel writers, never uses the designation “the Baptist” or “the Baptizer.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/3:1$p/E:1001070603/4-4:130$p/E:1001070603/5-5:280">study notes on Mt 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/1:4$p/E:1001070629/17-17:402"> Mr 1:4</a>.) The apostle John does distinguish between the three Marys. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:1-43:11:2" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Joh 11:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:25-43:19:25" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 19:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:1-43:20:1" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 20:1</a>) However, he did not need to make such a distinction when referring to John the Baptist, since the apostle never refers to himself by name and no one would misunderstand which John was meant. This is another confirmation that the apostle John wrote this Gospel.​—See “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070047/">Introduction to John</a>” and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070669/4-4:918">study note on Joh Title</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>as a witness:</strong> Or “for a witness.” The Greek noun for “witness” (<em>mar·ty·riʹa</em>) appears more than twice as often in John’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> as in the other three Gospels combined. The related verb, rendered <strong>to bear witness</strong> (<em>mar·ty·reʹo</em>), appears 39 times in John’s Gospel​—compared to 2 times in the other Gospel accounts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:31-40:23:31" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Mt 23:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:22-42:4:22" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Lu 4:22</a>) This Greek verb is used so often in connection with John the Baptist that some have suggested that he be called “John the Witness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:8-43:1:8" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Joh 1:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:15-43:1:15" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:32-43:1:32" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:34-43:1:34" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:26-43:3:26" data-bid="38-5" class="b"> 3:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:33-43:5:33" data-bid="38-6" class="b"> 5:33</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:19$p/E:1001070669/44-44:379">study note on Joh 1:19</a>.) In John’s Gospel, this verb is also frequently used in connection with Jesus’ ministry. Jesus is often said to “bear witness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:14-43:8:14" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Joh 8:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:17-43:8:18" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 17, 18</a>) Particularly noteworthy are Jesus’ words to Pontius Pilate: “For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Joh 18:37</a>) In the Revelation given to John, Jesus is referred to as “the Faithful Witness” and “the faithful and true witness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:5-66:1:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Re 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>world:</strong> The Greek word <em>koʹsmos</em> here refers to the world of mankind. In this context, the expression <strong>come into the world</strong> seems to refer primarily to Jesus’ going out among mankind at the time of his baptism rather than to his birth as a human. After his baptism, he carried out his assigned ministry, acting as a light bearer to the world of mankind.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:17-43:3:17" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Joh 3:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:19-43:3:19" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:14-43:6:14" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:39-43:9:39" data-bid="44-4" class="b"> 9:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:36-43:10:36" data-bid="44-5" class="b"> 10:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:27-43:11:27" data-bid="44-6" class="b"> 11:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:46-43:12:46" data-bid="44-7" class="b"> 12:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:9" data-bid="44-8" class="b"> 1Jo 4:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>the world came into existence through him:</strong> Here the Greek word <em>koʹsmos</em> (“world”) refers to the world of mankind, which is evident later in the verse where it says that <strong>the world did not know him.</strong> The Greek term was sometimes used in secular writings to refer to the universe and creation in general, and the apostle Paul may have used it in that sense when he was addressing a Greek audience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:24-44:17:24" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ac 17:24</a>) However, in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, the term generally refers to the world of mankind or a part of it. It is true that Jesus did share in the production of all things, including the heavens and the earth and all things in it. But the focus of this verse is his role in bringing humankind into existence.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ge 1:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Joh 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:17" data-bid="47-3" class="b"> Col 1:15-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>flesh:</strong> Or “a human being.” The Greek word <em>sarx</em> is here used in the sense of a physical being, a living being with flesh. When Jesus was born as a human, he was no longer a spirit. He did not merely assume a fleshly body, as angels had done in the past. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:1-1:18:3" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ge 18:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:1-1:19:1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 19:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:13-6:5:15" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Jos 5:13-15</a>) Therefore, Jesus could rightly call himself “the Son of man.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:51-43:1:51" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Joh 1:51;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:14-43:3:14" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/8:20$p/E:1001070608/34-34:414">study note on Mt 8:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>the Word became flesh:</strong> Jesus was entirely human from his birth until his death. Jesus explained the purpose of his becoming flesh when he said: “The bread that I will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:51-43:6:51" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Joh 6:51</a>) In addition, only because Jesus was wholly human could he experience what humans of flesh and blood experience and thus become a sympathetic High Priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:15-58:4:15" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Heb 4:15</a>) Jesus could not have been human and divine at the same time; the Scriptures say that he “was made a little lower than angels.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Heb 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:5" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Ps 8:4, 5</a>; see study note on <strong>flesh</strong> in this verse.) However, not all agreed that Jesus had come in the flesh. For example, the Gnostics, who believed that knowledge (Greek, <em>gnoʹsis</em>) could be gained in a mystical way, combined Greek philosophy and Oriental mysticism with apostate Christian teachings. They held that all physical matter is evil. For that reason, they taught that Jesus did not come in the flesh but only seemed to have a human body. An early form of gnosticism was apparently prevalent at the end of the first century C.E., so John may be making a specific point when he writes that “the Word became flesh.” In his letters, John warns against the false teaching that Jesus did not come “in the flesh.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:2-62:4:3" data-bid="54-1" class="b">1Jo 4:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:7-63:1:7" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 2Jo 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>resided:</strong> Lit., “tented.” Some have taken the statement that the Word ‘resided, or tented, among us’ to mean that Jesus was, not a true human, but an incarnation. However, Peter used the related noun that is rendered “tabernacle,” or “tent,” when he spoke of his own fleshly body as a temporary dwelling place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:13-61:1:13" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2Pe 1:13</a>; ftn.) Though Peter knew that his death was near and that his resurrection would be in the spirit, not in the flesh, he was not indicating that he was an incarnation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:13-61:1:15" data-bid="56-1" class="b">2Pe 1:13-15</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:35-46:15:38" data-bid="57-1" class="b">1Co 15:35-38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:44" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 42-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:2-62:3:2" data-bid="57-3" class="b"> 1Jo 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>we had a view of his glory:</strong> In Jesus’ life and ministry, John and the other apostles saw a glory, a splendor or magnificence, that could be displayed only by someone who perfectly reflected the qualities of Jehovah. In addition, the apostle John, along with James and Peter, witnessed the transfiguration of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:9" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Mt 17:1-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:1-41:9:9" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> Mr 9:1-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:28-42:9:36" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Lu 9:28-36</a>) So John may here have alluded not only to Jesus’ reflection of God’s qualities but also to the transfiguration vision that had occurred more than 60 years earlier. This event also made a lasting impression on the apostle Peter, who wrote his letters about 30 years before John wrote his <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>. Peter specifically referred to the transfiguration as a marvelous confirmation of “the prophetic word.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:17-61:1:19" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2Pe 1:17-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>an only-begotten son:</strong> The Greek word <em>mo·no·ge·nesʹ,</em> traditionally translated “only-begotten,” has been defined as “the only one of its kind; one and only; unique.” The Bible uses the term in describing the relation of sons and daughters to their parents. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/7:12$p/E:1001070651/14-14:840">study notes on Lu 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/8:42$p/E:1001070652/48-48:857"> 8:42;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/9:38$p/E:1001070653/45-45:835"> 9:38</a>.) In the apostle John’s writings, this term is used exclusively of Jesus (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Joh 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:18-43:3:18" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:9-62:4:9" data-bid="60-3" class="b"> 1Jo 4:9</a>) but never about Jesus’ human birth or existence as a man. Instead, John uses the term to describe Jesus in his prehuman existence as the Logos, or the Word, the one who “was in the beginning with God,” even “before the world was.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:2" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Joh 1:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:5-43:17:5" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 17:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:24-43:17:24" data-bid="61-3" class="b"> 24</a>) Jesus is the “only-begotten son” because he was Jehovah’s Firstborn and the only one created directly by God. While other spirit creatures are likewise called “sons of the true God” or “sons of God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:2-1:6:2" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Ge 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:4-1:6:4" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:1" data-bid="62-4" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:7" data-bid="62-5" class="b"> 38:4-7</a>), all those sons were created by Jehovah <em>through</em> that firstborn Son (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Col 1:15, 16</a>). In summary, the term <em>mo·no·ge·nesʹ</em> refers both to Jesus’ being “one of a kind; unique; incomparable” and to his being the only son produced directly and solely by God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:18-62:5:18" data-bid="64-1" class="b">1Jo 5:18</a>; see study note on Heb 11:17.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>divine favor:</strong> Or “undeserved kindness.” The Greek word <em>khaʹris</em> occurs more than 150 times in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> and conveys different shades of meaning, depending on the context. When referring to the undeserved kindness that God shows toward humans, the word describes a free gift given generously by God with no expectation of repayment. It is an expression of God’s bounteous giving and generous love and kindness that the recipient has done nothing to merit or earn; it is motivated solely by the generosity of the giver. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:4-45:4:4" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ro 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:6-45:11:6" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 11:6</a>) This term does not necessarily highlight that the recipients are unworthy of receiving kindness, which is why Jesus could be a recipient of this favor, or kindness, from God. In contexts involving Jesus, the term is appropriately rendered “divine favor,” as in this verse, or “favor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:40-42:2:40" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Lu 2:40,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 52</a>) In other contexts, the Greek term is rendered “favor” and “kind gift.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:30-42:1:30" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Lu 1:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:47-44:2:47" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> Ac 2:47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:46-44:7:46" data-bid="67-3" class="b"> 7:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:3-46:16:3" data-bid="67-4" class="b"> 1Co 16:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:19-47:8:19" data-bid="67-5" class="b"> 2Co 8:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>full of divine favor and truth:</strong> “The Word,” Jesus Christ, had God’s favor and was always truthful. But the context indicates that this phrase involves more; Jehovah specially chose his Son to explain and demonstrate the Father’s undeserved kindness and truth in full measure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:16-43:1:17" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Joh 1:16, 17</a>) These qualities of God were so fully revealed through Jesus that he could say: “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Joh 14:9</a>) Jesus was God’s means of extending undeserved kindness and truth to any who would favorably receive such.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>The one coming behind me:</strong> John the Baptist was born some six months before Jesus and started his ministry before Jesus did. In that sense, Jesus came “behind,” or after, John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:24-42:1:24" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Lu 1:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:26" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:1-42:3:20" data-bid="71-3" class="b"> 3:1-20</a>) Jesus, however, did far greater works than John, so in that sense, he <strong>advanced in front of</strong> John, or surpassed him, in every way. John the Baptist also acknowledged Jesus’ prehuman existence by saying that <strong>he existed before me.</strong></p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s5"><strong>undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness:</strong> The Greek word for “undeserved kindness” is <em>khaʹris.</em> In this context, it denotes God’s bounteous giving and generous love and kindness. This kindness is given unearned and unmerited; the giving is motivated solely by the generosity of the giver. (See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="130" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077337/">Undeserved kindness</a>.”) The doubling of the word <em>khaʹris</em> combined with the Greek preposition <em>an·tiʹ</em> (here rendered “upon”) denotes an abundant, continual, or successive flow of undeserved kindness. The idea could also be expressed as “continual [or “constant”] undeserved kindness.”</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="s5"><strong>the only-begotten god:</strong> John is here referring to the Word, “Jesus Christ,” whom he earlier calls “a god.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Joh 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:17-43:1:17" data-bid="82-2" class="b"> 17</a>) John speaks of Jesus as being the only-begotten Son of God.

Jesus can rightly be called “a god” because of the way the term “god” is used in the Bible. This title conveys the basic idea of a mighty one, and it is even used of humans in the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:6-19:82:6" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Ps 82:6</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:1$p/E:1001070669/10-10:2796">study notes on Joh 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/10:34$p/E:1001070678/32-32:320"> 10:34</a>.)

As reflected in some Bible translations, some <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> read “the only-begotten Son.” But the earliest and most authoritative manuscripts read “the only-begotten god” (with the <a class="xt" data-xtid="36" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077363/">definite article</a> in Greek) or “only-begotten god” (without the definite article in Greek).</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5"><strong>at the Father’s side:</strong> Lit., “in the bosom of the Father.” This expression refers to a position of special favor and close fellowship.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:23-43:13:25" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Joh 13:23-25</a>) Jesus is thus described as the closest friend of Jehovah, the one person who could explain God more fully and thoroughly than anyone else could.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:27-40:11:27" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Mt 11:27</a>.</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="s5"><strong>the Lamb of God:</strong> After Jesus got baptized and returned from being tempted by the Devil, John the Baptist introduced him as “the Lamb of God.” This expression occurs only here and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:36-43:1:36" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Joh 1:36</a>. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070208/">App. A7</a>.) Comparing Jesus to a lamb is fitting. Throughout the Bible, sheep were offered in recognition of sin and to gain approach to God. This foreshadowed the sacrifice that Jesus would make when he surrendered his perfect human life in behalf of mankind. The expression “the Lamb of God” could reflect a number of passages in the inspired Scriptures. In view of John the Baptist’s familiarity with the Hebrew Scriptures, his words may have alluded to one or more of the following: the male sheep that Abraham offered up instead of his own son Isaac (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:13-1:22:13" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Ge 22:13</a>), the Passover lamb that was slaughtered in Egypt for the deliverance of the enslaved Israelites (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:1-2:12:13" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Ex 12:1-13</a>), or the male lamb that was offered up on God’s altar in Jerusalem each morning and evening (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:38-2:29:42" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Ex 29:38-42</a>). John may also have had in mind Isaiah’s prophecy, where the one whom Jehovah calls “my servant” is said to be “brought like a sheep to the slaughter.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:52:13" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Isa 52:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:5-23:53:5" data-bid="110-2" class="b"> 53:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:7-23:53:7" data-bid="110-3" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:11-23:53:11" data-bid="110-4" class="b"> 11</a>) When the apostle Paul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians, he referred to Jesus as “our Passover lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="111-1" class="b">1Co 5:7</a>) The apostle Peter spoke of Christ’s “precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:19-60:1:19" data-bid="112-1" class="b">1Pe 1:19</a>) And more than 25 times in the book of Revelation, the glorified Jesus is spoken of figuratively as “the Lamb.”​—Some examples are: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:8-66:5:8" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Re 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:1" data-bid="113-2" class="b"> 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="113-3" class="b"> 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:11-66:12:11" data-bid="113-4" class="b"> 12:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:8-66:13:8" data-bid="113-5" class="b"> 13:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="113-6" class="b"> 14:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:3-66:15:3" data-bid="113-7" class="b"> 15:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:14-66:17:14" data-bid="113-8" class="b"> 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:7-66:19:7" data-bid="113-9" class="b"> 19:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:9" data-bid="113-10" class="b"> 21:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:1" data-bid="113-11" class="b"> 22:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="s5"><strong>the world:</strong> The Greek word <em>koʹsmos</em> is closely linked with mankind in secular Greek literature and particularly so in the Bible.

<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="s5"><strong>as a dove:</strong> Doves had both a sacred use and a symbolic meaning.

A dove released by Noah brought an olive leaf back to the ark, indicating that the floodwaters were receding (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:11-1:8:11" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Ge 8:11</a>) and that a time of rest and peace was at hand (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:29-1:5:29" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Ge 5:29</a>). Thus, at Jesus’ baptism, Jehovah may have used the representation of a dove to call attention to the role of Jesus as the Messiah​—he is the pure and sinless Son of God who would sacrifice his life for mankind and lay the basis for a period of rest and peace during his rule as King. The way that God’s holy <strong>spirit,</strong> or active force, came down upon Jesus at his baptism may have looked like the fluttering of a dove as it nears its perch.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:3-40:10:3" data-bid="140-1" class="b">Mt 10:3</a>) Bartholomew, meaning “Son of Tolmai,” was a patronymic term (that is, a designation derived from the father’s name). It was not exceptional for Nathanael to be called Bartholomew, or Son of Tolmai, as another man was simply called Bartimaeus, that is, the son of Timaeus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:46-41:10:46" data-bid="141-1" class="b">Mr 10:46</a>) When Matthew, Mark, and Luke talk about Bartholomew, they mention him along with Philip. Similarly, when John mentions Nathanael, he also links him with Philip, giving further evidence that Bartholomew and Nathanael were one and the same.

<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="s5"><strong>Can anything good come out of Nazareth?:</strong> It is commonly understood that Nathanael’s comment reflected the fact that Nazareth was an insignificant village, looked down on even by people of Galilee. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:2-43:21:2" data-bid="149-1" class="b">Joh 21:2</a>) Nazareth is not specifically mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures nor by <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a>, though the nearby Japhia (less than 3 km [2 mi] SW of Nazareth) is mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:12-6:19:12" data-bid="150-1" class="b">Jos 19:12</a> and by Josephus. However, not all cities in Galilee were mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures or by Josephus. It is also noteworthy that the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospels</a> always call Nazareth “a city” (Greek, <em>poʹlis</em>), a term that generally denotes a population center larger than a village. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:23-40:2:23" data-bid="151-1" class="b">Mt 2:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:26" data-bid="151-2" class="b"> Lu 1:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:4-42:2:4" data-bid="151-3" class="b"> 2:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:39-42:2:39" data-bid="151-4" class="b"> 39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:29-42:4:29" data-bid="151-5" class="b"> 4:29</a>) Nazareth stood in a mountain basin, surrounded by hills overlooking the plain of Esdraelon (Jezreel). The area was well-populated, with a number of cities and towns nearby. It was located close to important trade routes, so its inhabitants would have had access to information about the social, religious, and political activities of the time. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:23-42:4:23" data-bid="152-1" class="b">Lu 4:23</a>.) Nazareth also had its own synagogue. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:16-42:4:16" data-bid="153-1" class="b">Lu 4:16</a>) So it seems likely that it was not an insignificant village. Therefore, Nathanael may simply have been expressing surprise that Philip would think that a man from the neighboring city of Nazareth in Galilee could be the Promised One, since the Scriptures had foretold that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem in Judah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="154-1" class="b">Mic 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:42-43:7:42" data-bid="154-2" class="b"> Joh 7:42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:52-43:7:52" data-bid="154-3" class="b"> 52</a>.</p>

<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="s5"><strong>truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit:</strong> All descendants of Jacob were Israelites, but Jesus was no doubt referring to something more than fleshly kinship. The name Israel means “Contender (Perseverer) With God” and was given to Jacob after he wrestled with an angel in order to obtain a blessing. Unlike his brother, Esau, Jacob appreciated sacred things and was willing to exert himself vigorously to gain God’s favor.

Jesus’ words (which may reflect <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:2-19:32:2" data-bid="157-1" class="b">Ps 32:2</a>) also indicate that there was nothing hypocritical or devious about Nathanael.</p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="s5"><strong>You will see things greater than these:</strong> Nathanael soon began to see these words fulfilled. At a marriage feast in his hometown of Cana in Galilee, Nathanael witnessed Jesus’ first miracle, the turning of water into superb wine.

Besides seeing these things, Nathanael and the other apostles were themselves empowered to perform miracles and to share in proclaiming: “The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:1-40:10:8" data-bid="160-1" class="b">Mt 10:1-8</a>.</p>

<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="s5"><strong>Most truly:</strong> Lit., “Truly, truly.” Greek, <em>a·menʹ a·menʹ.</em> The Greek word <em>a·menʹ</em> is a <a class="xt" data-xtid="49" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077388/">transliteration</a> of the Hebrew <em>ʼa·menʹ,</em> meaning “so be it,” or “surely.” Jesus frequently uses the term <em>a·menʹ</em> to preface a statement, a promise, or a prophecy, thereby emphasizing its absolute truthfulness and reliability. Jesus’ use of “truly,” or amen, in this way is said to be unique in sacred literature. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:18-40:5:18" data-bid="162-1" class="b">Mt 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:28-41:3:28" data-bid="162-2" class="b"> Mr 3:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:24-42:4:24" data-bid="162-3" class="b"> Lu 4:24</a>) Only John’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> repeats the term in succession (<em>a·menʹ a·menʹ</em>), and it does so in all 25 occurrences. In this translation, the doubling of <em>a·menʹ</em> is rendered “most truly”; alternative renderings could be “very truly” or “most assuredly.” The whole phrase “Truly [or, “Most truly”] I say to you” could also be rendered: “I assure you” or “I tell you the truth.”</p>

Both words have the basic meaning of “messenger.” When spirit messengers are meant, the words are translated “angels,” but if the reference is definitely to humans, the rendering is “messengers.” The context usually makes clear whether human or angelic messengers are meant, but where both meanings are possible, footnotes often show the alternative rendering.
