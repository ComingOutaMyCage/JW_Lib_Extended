Paul’s Journeys After c. 61 C.E.




The book of Acts records many of Paul’s earlier travels, including three missionary tours and his journey to Rome from Caesarea. However, Paul’s letters provide clues about his travels after his first imprisonment in Rome (that is, after c. 61 C.E.), information not recorded in Acts. For example, Paul wrote about his plans to “journey to Spain,” though it is not clear whether he was able to fulfill this desire before his second imprisonment (c. 65 C.E.). (Ro 15:24) During his first confinement in Rome, Paul wrote that he wanted to return to Philippi and also to visit Colossae. (Php 2:24; Phm 22; compare Col 4:9.) In letters to Titus and to Timothy, written after Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome, Paul provides other details about his travels. He could have been in Ephesus with Timothy during this period. (1Ti 1:3) Tit 3:12 shows that Paul decided to spend the winter in Nicopolis. This map shows some of the locations that Paul may have visited.
