<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">After teaching a crowd in Capernaum, Jesus catches sight of the tax collector Matthew sitting at a tax office. Tax collectors were despised because many of them unjustly enriched themselves at the expense of the people. But Jesus sees something good in Matthew and invites him to be his follower. Matthew responds immediately, becoming the fifth disciple to join Jesus in his ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:1-42:5:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 5:1-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:27-42:5:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 27, 28</a>) Later, Jesus chose him to be one of the 12 apostles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:2-40:10:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 10:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:16-41:3:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mr 3:16-19</a>) Matthew’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> often reflects his background. For example, he is explicit in his mention of money, figures, and values. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:27-40:17:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 17:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:15-40:26:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 26:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:3-40:27:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 27:3</a>) He also highlights the mercy of God, who allowed him, a despised tax collector, to repent and become a minister of the good news.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:9-40:9:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 9:9-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:7-40:12:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:21-40:18:35" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 18:21-35</a>.</p>
