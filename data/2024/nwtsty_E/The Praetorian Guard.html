There he was guarded by Roman soldiers who probably belonged to an elite military force called the Praetorian Guard. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:16-44:28:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 28:16</a>) Even though there were thousands of Praetorian soldiers, Paul told the Philippian congregation that his prison bonds had become known “among all the Praetorian Guard.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:13-50:1:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Php 1:13</a>) Watch this video to learn more about the history and purpose of the Praetorian Guard.</p>
