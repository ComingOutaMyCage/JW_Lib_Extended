Paul Writes the Philippians a Letter of Love and Joy




When Epaphroditus returned to Philippi from Rome, he brought a letter from the apostle Paul, who was then a prisoner in Rome. (Php 1:13; 2:25; 4:18) The letter, which was addressed to the Philippian Christians, breathed love and joy. (Php 1:4; 2:17, 18; 3:1; 4:1, 4) Paul did not have to present strong argument and reproof as he had done in some other letters. He did encourage Euodia and Syntyche to work together in peace. Even so, he describes these two faithful sisters as “women who have striven side by side with [him] for the good news,” and he encourages one of his fellow workers to “keep assisting these women.” (Php 4:3) Throughout the letter, Paul encourages the Philippian congregation to continue in their fine course.​—Php 3:16.
