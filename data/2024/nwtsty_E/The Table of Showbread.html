<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In the first compartment of the tabernacle, called the Holy, there was a table made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold. “The showbread,” or according to the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> “the loaves of presentation,” was placed on that table. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:30-2:25:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 25:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:2-58:9:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb 9:2</a>) On Mount Sinai, Jehovah gave Moses a vision that included detailed instructions on how to make this table. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:9-2:25:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 25:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:23-2:25:29" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:8:4-4:8:4" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Nu 8:4</a>) It was to be two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070235/">App. B14</a>.) The Hebrew expression rendered “showbread” literally means “bread of the face.” The word for “face” sometimes denotes “presence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:13:23-12:13:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 13:23</a>) The showbread was constantly in front of Jehovah’s face as an offering. Every Sabbath, a priest had to place 12 fresh loaves on the table. The loaves were placed in two stacks of six each. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:4-3:24:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Le 24:4-8</a>) Paul mentions the table of showbread when discussing the old covenant and the tabernacle, comparing such physical things with greater heavenly realities.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:5-58:8:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb 8:5</a>.</p>
