A food pouch was a bag, usually made of leather, carried over the shoulder by travelers, shepherds, farmers, and others. It was used to hold food, clothing, and other items. When sending out his apostles on a preaching tour, Jesus gave them instructions regarding, among other things, staffs and food pouches. The apostles were to go as they were and not be distracted by procuring anything extra; Jehovah would provide for them.—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/9:3$p/E:1001070653/4-4:1316">study notes on Lu 9:3</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/10:4$p/E:1001070654/8-8:520">10:4</a> for a discussion of how the details of Jesus’ instructions were to be understood.</p>
