The Praetorian Guard




From about 59 to 61 C.E., while waiting to appear before Caesar, the apostle Paul spent two years under house arrest in Rome. There he was guarded by Roman soldiers who probably belonged to an elite military force called the Praetorian Guard. (Ac 28:16) Even though there were thousands of Praetorian soldiers, Paul told the Philippian congregation that his prison bonds had become known “among all the Praetorian Guard.” (Php 1:13) Watch this video to learn more about the history and purpose of the Praetorian Guard.
