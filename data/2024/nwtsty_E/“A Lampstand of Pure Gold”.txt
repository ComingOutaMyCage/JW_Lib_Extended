“A Lampstand of Pure Gold”




In the first compartment of the tabernacle, called the Holy, there was “a lampstand of pure gold” with seven lamps. By means of a vision on Mount Sinai, Jehovah gave Moses detailed instructions on how to make this lampstand. (Ex 25:31-40; Nu 8:4) In part, Moses was told: “Its base, its stem, its branches, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms will be one piece.” Together with its lamps and utensils, the lampstand was to weigh one talent, which would equal 34.2 kg (1,101 oz t). Every morning, a priest had to maintain, or take care of, the lamps​—for example, he would replace the wicks and replenish the oil. Every evening, he lit the lamps to provide light for the Holy. (Ex 27:20, 21; 30:7, 8) Paul mentions the lampstand when comparing the old covenant and the tabernacle with the superior new covenant and the heavenly realities of “the true tent.”​—Heb 8:2, 5.
