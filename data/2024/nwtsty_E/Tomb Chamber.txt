Tomb Chamber




The Jews usually buried their dead in caves or vaults cut into the rock. These tombs were customarily located outside the cities, an exception being the tombs of the kings. Jewish tombs that have been found are notable for their simplicity. This was evidently because the Jewsâ€™ worship allowed no veneration of the dead and did not foster any ideas of a conscious existence in a spirit world after death.
