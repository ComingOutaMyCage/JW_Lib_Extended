<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Cana:</strong> Probably from the Hebrew word <em>qa·nehʹ,</em> “reed”; hence, “Place of Reeds.” John alone mentions this town, always calling it <strong>Cana of Galilee</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:11-43:2:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:46-43:4:46" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:2-43:21:2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 21:2</a>), probably to distinguish it from Kanah (Hebrew, <em>Qa·nahʹ</em>) in Asher’s tribal territory (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 19:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:28-6:19:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 28</a>). The location favored by many scholars is Khirbet Qana, where there are ruins of an ancient village on a hill at the N edge of the Bet Netofa Valley (Plain of el-Battuf), about 13 km (8 mi) N of Nazareth. In Arabic, the place is still known as Qana el-Jelil, the equivalent of Cana of Galilee. Reeds are abundant in a nearby marshy plain, making the name Cana very fitting. There are remains of ancient cisterns and what are thought to be the ruins of a synagogue (dated to the late first century or to the second century C.E.). Potsherds (fragments of earthen vessels) and coins believed to date from the first century C.E. have also been found there. Church tradition favors an identification with Kafr Kanna, located 6.5 km (4 mi) NE of Nazareth, possibly because it is easily accessible to pilgrims from Nazareth. However, the name of this location seems to have no linguistic connection with the Cana of Galilee mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:4-43:2:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>2:4</strong></a></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Woman:</strong> Jesus’ use of this term when addressing his mother was consistent with his way of addressing other women (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:21-43:4:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joh 4:21</a>) and was apparently considered polite in many contexts (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:28-40:15:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mt 15:28</a>). It was not understood to be rude, unkind, or disrespectful in any way. Angels and the resurrected Jesus used this form of address when speaking to Mary Magdalene when she was weeping in sorrow at Jesus’ tomb; their words would surely not have been harsh or disrespectful in such a situation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:13-43:20:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joh 20:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:15-43:20:15" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 15</a>) On the torture stake, Jesus used the same term to address his mother when his great concern for her moved him to place her in the care of his beloved apostle John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:26-43:19:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joh 19:26</a>) He made this arrangement because of the Scriptural obligation to honor one’s father and mother. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:12-2:20:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex 20:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:16-5:5:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> De 5:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:4-40:15:4" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Mt 15:4</a>) Several reference works confirm that using the term “woman” as a form of address could reflect respect and affection.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="s5"><strong>why is that of concern to me and to you?:</strong> When Mary told Jesus: “They have no wine” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:3-43:2:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Joh 2:3</a>), she was no doubt suggesting that he do something about it. This is noteworthy, since Jesus had performed no miracles up to that point. The <a class="xt" data-xtid="45" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077383/">Semitic</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="48" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077368/"> idiom</a> used in response, which is literally “what to me and to you?” basically indicates some objection and must be understood according to context. While it sometimes expresses hostility and repulsion (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:29-40:8:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mt 8:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:24-41:1:24" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Mr 1:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:7-41:5:7" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:34-42:4:34" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Lu 4:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:28-42:8:28" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 8:28</a>), it appears to be a gentle objection in this instance. (Examples of the milder use of this idiom can be found in the Hebrew Scriptures, such as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:9-10:16:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Sa 16:9, 10</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:18-11:17:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1Ki 17:18</a>, ftn.) Jesus’ following words indicate why he was hesitant: <strong>My hour has not yet come.</strong> Still, Jesus’ response to her suggestion must have indicated that he was not opposed to providing help, as Mary’s reaction in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:5-43:2:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">verse 5</a> shows.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:6-43:2:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>2:6</strong></a></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>liquid measures:</strong> Many scholars equate the measure mentioned here (Greek, <em>me·tre·tesʹ</em>) with the Hebrew bath measure. Based on jar fragments bearing the designation “bath” in ancient Hebrew characters, some scholars understand the capacity of the bath measure to be about 22 L (5.81 gal). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:26-11:7:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Ki 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:22-15:7:22" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Ezr 7:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:14-26:45:14" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Eze 45:14</a>) If so, each of the water jars could hold between 44 and 66 L (11.6 and 17.4 gal), and the six jars combined would contain about 260 to 390 L (68.6 to 103 gal). Other scholars, though, believe that a larger Greek unit of measure (up to 40 L [10.5 gal]) may be referred to here.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070235/">App. B14</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:11-43:2:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>2:11</strong></a></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>as the beginning of his signs:</strong> Jesus’ changing water into fine wine was the first of the signs, or miracles, that he performed. This event is recorded by John only.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:13-43:2:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>2:13</strong></a></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>the Passover:</strong> Jesus started his preaching activity after his baptism in the fall of 29 C.E., so this reference to a Passover early in his ministry must have been to the one celebrated in the spring of 30 C.E. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/3:1$p/E:1001070647/4-4:1267">study note on Lu 3:1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070208/">App. A7</a>.) A comparison of the four <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> accounts indicates that four Passovers were celebrated during Jesus’ earthly ministry, leading to the conclusion that his ministry was three and a half years long. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke (often called the synoptic Gospels) do not mention any Passover except the final one, at which Jesus died. John’s account specifically mentions three Passovers (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:13-43:2:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joh 2:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:4-43:6:4" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:55-43:11:55" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 11:55</a>), and a fourth one is most likely referred to by the expression “a festival of the Jews” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:1-43:5:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Joh 5:1</a>. This example highlights the value of comparing the Gospel accounts to gain a more complete picture of Jesus’ life.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/5:1$p/E:1001070673/4-4:1476">study notes on Joh 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/6:4$p/E:1001070674/6-6:166"> 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/11:55$p/E:1001070679/47-47:143"> 11:55</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:14-43:2:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>2:14</strong></a></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>the temple:</strong> Probably referring to the part of the temple area known as the Court of the Gentiles.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070231/">App. B11</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>those selling cattle and sheep and doves:</strong> God’s Law required that the Israelites make sacrifices at the temple, and visitors needed food provisions during their stay in Jerusalem. Some Israelites had to travel long distances to get there, so the Law allowed them to sell their produce and animals, bring the money to Jerusalem, and buy such offerings as cattle, sheep, goats, and doves as well as what they needed for their stay in the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:23-5:14:26" data-bid="22-1" class="b">De 14:23-26</a>) Over time, merchants set up businesses to sell sacrificial animals and birds right inside the temple complex. (See study note on <strong>the temple</strong> in this verse.) Likely, some of the merchants were cheating the people by charging too much.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:15-43:2:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>2:15</strong></a></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>a whip of ropes:</strong> The Greek word for “rope” (<em>skhoi·niʹon</em>) may denote a cord made of reeds, rushes, or other materials. When Jesus used the whip of ropes to drive “the sheep and cattle out of the temple,” the sellers of these animals would naturally have followed their livestock out of the temple area. In the following verse, when he verbally evicted the men selling doves, there is no mention of the whip, indicating that he did not use it on the sellers. Even so, the result was that those who were commercializing true worship were forced to leave the temple premises.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple:</strong> While on earth, Jesus twice cleansed the temple in Jerusalem of commercialism. What is described here is the first cleansing, which took place in connection with the Passover in 30 C.E. and Jesus’ first visit to Jerusalem as the anointed Son of God. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070208/">App. A7</a>.) On Nisan 10, 33 C.E., Jesus cleansed the temple a second time. This occasion is described in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospels</a> of Matthew (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:12-40:21:13" data-bid="24-1" class="b">21:12, 13</a>), Mark (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:15-41:11:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">11:15-18</a>), and Luke (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:45-42:19:46" data-bid="26-1" class="b">19:45, 46</a>).​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070213/">App. A7</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>money changers:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/21:12$p/E:1001070621/25-25:426">study note on Mt 21:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:16-43:2:16" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>2:16</strong></a></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>a house of commerce:</strong> Or “a marketplace; a business.” The Greek phrase <em>oiʹkon em·po·riʹou,</em> rendered “a house of commerce,” means “a place where business is carried on; a market.” It occurs only here in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>. The sale of sacrifices within the temple grounds was one of the chief sources of income for the wealthy and powerful house of chief priest Annas.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:17-43:2:17" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>2:17</strong></a></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>zeal for your house:</strong> In this context, the Greek word (<em>zeʹlos</em>), here rendered “zeal,” denotes an intense, positive, burning interest, marked by a sense of dedication. The scripture that the disciples called to mind can be found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:9-19:69:9" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps 69:9</a>. There the corresponding Hebrew noun (<em>qin·ʼahʹ</em>), rendered “zeal,” may convey such meanings as “insistence on exclusive devotion; toleration of no rivalry.” When Jesus saw all the commercial activity in the temple area, he was righteously indignant, and his zeal moved him to action.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:19-43:2:19" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>2:19</strong></a></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>Tear down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up:</strong> Only John records these words spoken by Jesus. The Jews thought that he was speaking of the temple of Herod. At Jesus’ trial, his opposers quoted and distorted his words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:61-40:26:61" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mt 26:61;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:40-40:27:40" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 27:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:58-41:14:58" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Mr 14:58</a>) As shown at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:21-43:2:21" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Joh 2:21</a>, Jesus was using figurative speech; he was comparing his anticipated death and resurrection to the demolition and reconstruction of the temple. Although Jesus said: “I will raise it up,” the Scriptures clearly show that it was God who resurrected him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:40-44:10:40" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ac 10:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:11-45:8:11" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Ro 8:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:20-58:13:20" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> Heb 13:20</a>) After being put to death and on the third day resurrected (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:21-40:16:21" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Mt 16:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:7-42:24:7" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Lu 24:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:21-42:24:21" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:46-42:24:46" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 46</a>), Jesus was given another body, not one made with hands like the temple in Jerusalem, but a spirit body made by his Father (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:24-44:2:24" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ac 2:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 1Pe 3:18</a>). In the Scriptures, the figurative use of a temple being applied to people is not unusual. The Messiah was foretold to be “the chief cornerstone” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:22-19:118:22" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps 118:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:16-23:28:17" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Isa 28:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:10-44:4:11" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> Ac 4:10, 11</a>), and Paul and Peter used similar comparisons regarding Jesus and his followers at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:16-46:3:17" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1Co 3:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:19-46:6:19" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 6:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:20" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> Eph 2:20</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:6-60:2:7" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1Pe 2:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>This temple was built</strong> <strong>in 46</strong> <strong>years:</strong> The Jews were referring to the temple rebuilding work done by King Herod. The first temple in Jerusalem, built by Solomon, was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 B.C.E. It was rebuilt under the direction of Zerubbabel after the Babylonian captivity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:13-15:6:15" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ezr 6:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:2-37:2:4" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Hag 2:2-4</a>) According to <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a> (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 380 [xi, 1]), Herod started his rebuilding project in the 18th year of his reign. If counted in the way that the Jews viewed the regnal years of their kings, that could mean 18/17 B.C.E.
