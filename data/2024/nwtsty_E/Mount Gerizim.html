Mount Gerizim is situated in the heart of the district of Samaria. Its summit rises over 850 m (2,800 ft) above the Mediterranean Sea. The present-day city of Nablus is situated between the mountains in the fertile valley of Shechem. A Samaritan temple was constructed on Mount Gerizim, perhaps in the fourth century B.C.E., but it was destroyed in 128 B.C.E. It was evidently with reference to Mount Gerizim that the Samaritan woman told Jesus Christ: “Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.” To show her that true worship was not to be dependent on a physical location, Jesus replied: “The hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:20-43:4:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 4:20, 21</a>.</p>
