Roman Soldierâ€™s Suit of Armor




In his letter to the Ephesians, the apostle Paul uses a suit of armor to illustrate the spiritual protection needed by a servant of Jehovah. (Eph 6:11-17) Paul may have been thinking of the armor worn by a Roman soldier. Each piece in such a suit of armor played a vital role in protecting the soldier in battle. The spiritual suit of armor that Paul describes consists of a belt, a breastplate, footwear, a large shield, a helmet, and a sword. This video shows what the different parts of a Roman suit of armor may have looked like.
