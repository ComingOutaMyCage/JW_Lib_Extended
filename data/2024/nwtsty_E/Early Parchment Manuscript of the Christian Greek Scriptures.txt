Early Parchment Manuscript of the Christian Greek Scriptures




The parchment manuscript shown here contains Ac 5:3-21. This leaf, known as Uncial 0189, was once part of a codex containing the book of Acts. The front side (on the left) shows Ac 5:3-12, and the reverse side (on the right) shows Ac 5:12-21. Some scholars date this manuscript to the end of the second century C.E. or the beginning of the third, although others have dated it to the third or fourth century C.E. Though there are older papyrus fragments, this is one of the oldest known parchment manuscripts of the Christian Greek Scriptures. It is housed at the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, Germany.
