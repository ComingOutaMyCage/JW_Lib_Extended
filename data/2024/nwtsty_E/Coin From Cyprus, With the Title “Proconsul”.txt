Coin From Cyprus, With the Title “Proconsul”




The coin shown here, found in Cyprus, was minted during the reign of Roman Emperor Claudius, who was in power when Paul and Barnabas visited Cyprus about 47 C.E. One side of the coin shows Claudius’ head and title, and the other side uses the Greek word for “proconsul” to describe the governor of that island. The wording on the coin verifies the accuracy of Luke’s account, in which he identifies Sergius Paulus as “the proconsul” of Cyprus.​—Ac 13:4, 7.
