<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>Gerasenes:</strong> In the parallel accounts of this event (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:28-40:8:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 8:28-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:1-41:5:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mr 5:1-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:26-42:8:39" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Lu 8:26-39</a>), different names are used for where this event took place. For each account, there are also different readings in ancient <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a>. According to the best available manuscripts, Matthew originally used “Gadarenes,” whereas Mark and Luke employed “Gerasenes.” However, as shown in the study note on <strong>region of the Gerasenes</strong> in this verse, both of these terms refer to the same general region.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>region of the Gerasenes:</strong> A region on the <strong>other</strong> (the eastern) shore of the Sea of Galilee. The exact limits of this region are unknown today, and the identification is uncertain. Some link “the region of the Gerasenes” with the area around Kursi, near the steep slopes on the E shore of the sea. Others think that it was the large district radiating from the city of Gerasa (Jarash), which was 55 km (34 mi) SSE of the Sea of Galilee. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:28-40:8:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 8:28</a> calls it “the region of the Gadarenes.” (See study note on <strong>Gerasenes</strong> in this verse and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/8:28$p/E:1001070608/45-45:454">study note on Mt 8:28</a>.) Although different names are used, they refer to the same general area of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, and the regions may have been overlapping. So the accounts are not contradictory.​—See also <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070210/">App. A7</a>, Map 3B, “Activity at the Sea of Galilee,” and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070230/">App. B10</a>.</p>

Mark and Luke evidently drew attention to just one demon-possessed man because Jesus spoke to him and because his case was more outstanding. Possibly, that man was more violent or had suffered under demon control for a longer time. It could also be that after the two men were healed, only one of them wanted to accompany Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:18-41:5:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mr 5:18-20</a>.</p>

The exact meaning may vary, depending on context. In this verse (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:7-41:5:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mr 5:7</a>), the idiom expresses hostility and repulsion, and some have suggested such a rendering as: “Do not bother me!” or “Leave me alone!” In other contexts, it is used to express a difference in viewpoint, or opinion, or to refuse involvement in a suggested action without indicating disdain, arrogance, or hostility.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/2:4$p/E:1001070670/7-7:881">study note on Joh 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>torment me:</strong> A related Greek term is used of “the jailers” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:34-40:18:34" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mt 18:34</a> (see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/18:34$p/E:1001070618/43-43:348">study note</a>). So in this context, the “torment” would seem to refer to a restraining or a confining to “the abyss” mentioned in the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:31-42:8:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lu 8:31</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>Legion:</strong> Likely, this was not the demon-possessed man’s actual name, but it indicates that the man was possessed by many demons. Possibly, the chief one of these demons caused this man to say that his name was Legion. In the first century C.E., a Roman legion usually consisted of some 6,000 men, which may indicate that a large number of demons were involved.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:53$p/E:1001070626/80-80:284">study note on Mt 26:53</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>swine:</strong> Pigs were unclean according to the Law (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:7-3:11:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Le 11:7</a>), but there was a market for pork among the many non-Jews living in the Decapolis region; both Greeks and Romans considered pork a delicacy. The account does not state whether the herders were Jews who were violating the Law.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:14-41:5:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mr 5:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>report to them:</strong> In contrast with Jesus’ usual instructions not to publicize his miracles (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:44-41:1:44" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mr 1:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:12-41:3:12" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:36-41:7:36" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 7:36</a>), he instructed this man to tell his relatives what had happened. This may have been because Jesus was asked to leave the region and would not personally give them a witness; it would also serve to counteract unfavorable reports that might circulate over the loss of the swine.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>all the things Jehovah has done for you:</strong> Speaking to the man who had been healed, Jesus is attributing the miracle, not to himself, but to his heavenly Father. This conclusion is supported by Luke’s use of the Greek word <em>The·osʹ</em> (God) in recording the same event. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:39-42:8:39" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Lu 8:39</a>) Although most Greek <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> read “the Lord” (<em>ho Kyʹri·os</em>) here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:19-41:5:19" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mr 5:19</a>, there are good reasons to believe that the divine name was originally used in this verse and later replaced with the title Lord. Therefore, the name Jehovah is used in the main text.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C1</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079341/3-14">Mr 5:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>Daughter:</strong> The only recorded instance in which Jesus directly addressed a woman as “daughter,” perhaps because of her delicate situation and her “trembling.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:33-41:5:33" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mr 5:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:47-42:8:47" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Lu 8:47</a>) By using this term of endearment, a form of address that signifies nothing about the woman’s age, Jesus emphasizes his tender concern for her.</p>

The Hebrew word often rendered “peace” (<em>sha·lohmʹ</em>) has a broad meaning. It refers to the state of being free from war or disturbance (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:17-7:4:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Jg 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:14-9:7:14" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 1Sa 7:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:8-21:3:8" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Ec 3:8</a>) and can also convey the idea of health, safety, soundness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:6-9:25:6" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1Sa 25:6</a>, ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:5-14:15:5" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2Ch 15:5</a>, ftn.; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:5:24-18:5:24" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 5:24</a>, ftn.), welfare (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:10:3-17:10:3" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Es 10:3</a>, ftn.), as well as friendship (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:9-19:41:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps 41:9</a>). In the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, the Greek word for “peace” (<em>ei·reʹne</em>) was used with the same broad connotations as the Hebrew word to express the ideas of well-being, salvation, and harmony, in addition to the absence of conflict.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>your grievous sickness:</strong> Lit., “your scourging.” The literal meaning of this word refers to a form of whipping often used as torture.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>only exercise faith:</strong> Or “just keep exercising faith.” The Greek verb form used here may indicate continuous action.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="s5"><strong>with great ecstasy:</strong> Or “with great amazement.” The Greek word <em>ekʹsta·sis</em> (from <em>ek,</em> meaning “out of,” and <em>staʹsis,</em> meaning “standing”) refers to a person’s being cast out of his normal state of mind because of amazement, astonishment, or a vision from God. The Greek word is rendered “overwhelmed with emotion” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:8-41:16:8" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Mr 16:8</a> and “amazement” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:26-42:5:26" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Lu 5:26</a>.
