The Table of Showbread




In the first compartment of the tabernacle, called the Holy, there was a table made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold. “The showbread,” or according to the Christian Greek Scriptures “the loaves of presentation,” was placed on that table. (Ex 25:30; Heb 9:2) On Mount Sinai, Jehovah gave Moses a vision that included detailed instructions on how to make this table. (Ex 25:9, 23-29; Nu 8:4) It was to be two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. (See App. B14.) The Hebrew expression rendered “showbread” literally means “bread of the face.” The word for “face” sometimes denotes “presence.” (2Ki 13:23) The showbread was constantly in front of Jehovah’s face as an offering. Every Sabbath, a priest had to place 12 fresh loaves on the table. The loaves were placed in two stacks of six each. (Le 24:4-8) Paul mentions the table of showbread when discussing the old covenant and the tabernacle, comparing such physical things with greater heavenly realities.​—Heb 8:5.
