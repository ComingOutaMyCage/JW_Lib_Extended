When these Christians meet for worship, they likely do so in a modest private home rather than in an elaborate building. In his letter to the Colossians, Paul encouraged them to “keep on teaching and encouraging one another with psalms, praises to God, [and] spiritual songs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:16-51:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col 3:16</a>) So in addition to singing the inspired psalms from the Hebrew Scriptures, they may have sung new compositions based on Christian themes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:26-41:14:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mr 14:26</a>) Paul knew firsthand that “praising God with song” can bring comfort and encouragement.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:25-44:16:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 16:25</a>.</p>
