<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Jesus painted a touching word picture, likening his concern for the people of Jerusalem to the protectiveness of a hen that is sheltering her young with her wings. This illustration, as well as Jesus’ reference to a son who asks his father for an egg (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:11-42:11:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 11:11, 12</a>), indicates that the domestic hen was common in first-century Israel. Though the Greek word <em>orʹnis,</em> used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:37-40:23:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 23:37</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:34-42:13:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 13:34</a>, could refer to any bird, wild or domesticated, in this context it is understood to refer to a hen, the most common and useful of the domestic fowl.</p>
