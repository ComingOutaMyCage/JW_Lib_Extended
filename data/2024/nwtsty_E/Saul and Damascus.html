<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In the first century C.E., the city of Damascus likely had a layout similar to what is shown here. It was an important center for trade, and water drawn from the nearby Barada River (the Abanah of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:12-12:5:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 5:12</a>) made the area around the city like an oasis. Damascus had a number of synagogues. Saul came to that city intending to arrest “any whom he found who belonged to The Way,” an expression used to describe the followers of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:2-44:9:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ac 9:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:9-44:19:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:23-44:19:23" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:4-44:22:4" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 22:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:22-44:24:22" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 24:22</a>) On the road to Damascus, however, the glorified Jesus appeared to Saul. After that, Saul stayed for a time in Damascus at the house of a man named Judas, who lived on the street called Straight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:11-44:9:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 9:11</a>) In a vision, Jesus directed the disciple Ananias to Judas’ house to restore Saul’s sight, and Saul later got baptized. So instead of arresting the Jewish Christians, Saul became one of them. He began his career as a preacher of the good news in the synagogues of Damascus. After traveling to Arabia and then back to Damascus, Saul returned to Jerusalem, likely about the year 36 C.E.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ac 9:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:19-44:9:22" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:16-48:1:17" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ga 1:16, 17</a>.</p>
