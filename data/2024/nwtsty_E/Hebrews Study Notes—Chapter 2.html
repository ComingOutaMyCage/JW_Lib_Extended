<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>That is why it is necessary for us:</strong> Paul links the counsel in this verse to the subject he has been discussing​—the superiority of Christ to the angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:1-58:1:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb 1:1-14</a>) In the past, God spoke by means of imperfect human prophets and even angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:2-58:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb 2:2</a>) Now, in contrast, God has done something even greater; he has spoken by means of his own Son, the one who is at God’s right hand. It is thus necessary to listen to God’s greatest Spokesman.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s5"><strong>pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard:</strong> Paul here uses emphatic language to stress that Christians need to pay particularly earnest, close attention to what they have learned from the teachings of God’s own Son. For Hebrew Christians, there was a danger of being distracted by the powerful influence of Judaism, with its impressive temple, priesthood, and traditions. They needed to maintain their focus. The Greek verb here rendered “pay . . . attention to” was used for mooring a ship or for holding it on course toward harbor. Christians likewise needed to hold on to what they had learned, never loosening their grip. Some scholars have suggested that this is the first part of a nautical <a class="xt" data-xtid="54" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077378/">metaphor</a> that is further developed in the following phrase.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>so that we never drift away:</strong> Paul may be continuing a nautical illustration here. The Greek word rendered “drift away” was sometimes used regarding a ship that was in danger of drifting past its safe harbor. Strong currents or contrary winds could cause a ship to drift, especially if the crew were inattentive. Such a word picture would emphasize Paul’s urgent warning: If the Hebrew Christians allowed themselves to become careless or neglectful, they would likely drift away from the true faith and lose out on salvation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:3-58:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb 2:3</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/3:12$p/E:1001070807/33-33:715">study note on Heb 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:2-58:2:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>2:2</strong></a></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>the word spoken through angels:</strong> This is the third passage in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> to mention that God used angels in transmitting the Mosaic Law to his people. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/7:53$p/E:1001070696/60-60:374">study notes on Ac 7:53;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070152/3:19$p/E:1001070765/38-38:548"> Ga 3:19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:38-44:7:38" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ac 7:38</a>.) The Hebrew Scriptures do not explicitly reveal that fact. However, many Jews in Paul’s day would likely have agreed with this statement. First-century Jewish tradition held that God employed angels to transmit the Law. (Compare <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077411/">Josephus</a>, <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> Book 15, chap. 5, par. 3 [Loeb 15.136].) It is worth noting that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:2-5:33:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 33:2</a>, Moses mentioned that Jehovah was with his “holy myriads” and “his warriors”; the following verses say that Jehovah gave the Law to his people. In verse 2, the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> uses the Greek word for “angels” instead of “warriors.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="s5"><strong>proved to be sure:</strong> Paul stresses how sure the Mosaic Law was by noting that it meted out justice for “every transgression.” It was also firm, or legally binding, over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:3-58:2:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>2:3</strong></a></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>neglected:</strong> The Greek verb rendered “neglected” means “to be unconcerned; not to care about.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:5-40:22:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mt 22:5</a>, where the same verb is rendered “unconcerned.”) Thus, a Christian who neglects his salvation through Christ does not do so unintentionally; rather, his lack of concern is a deliberate choice. That is why Paul urged the Hebrew Christians “to pay more than the usual attention” to the word of God through His Son.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:1-58:2:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb 2:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>For it began to be spoken through our Lord:</strong> God spoke the message of salvation through “our Lord,” that is, Jesus Christ. Many of his listeners became disciples and witnessed to others; they thus <strong>verified,</strong> or confirmed, what Jesus himself said. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mt 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:1-44:1:1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ac 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:39-44:10:43" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 10:39-43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:6" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 1Ti 2:5, 6</a>) Therefore, even believers who may not have seen or heard Jesus in person could still be certain that the message of salvation was conveyed by none other than the Son of God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:8-60:1:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1Pe 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:4-58:2:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>2:4</strong></a></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>God joined in bearing witness:</strong> When the first-century Christians preached about Jesus, Jehovah God confirmed their testimony by enabling them to perform supernatural <strong>signs and wonders and various powerful works.</strong> (See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="201" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077195/">Miracles; Powerful works</a>,” and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/2:19$p/E:1001070691/24-24:448">study notes on Ac 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/4:22$p/E:1001070693/22-22:140"> 4:22</a>.) In some cases, God bore witness by giving them miraculous gifts of the holy spirit, such as speaking in tongues, prophesying, the understanding of inspired expressions, and powers to heal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:4-46:12:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1Co 12:4-11</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/12:4$p/E:1001070745/8-8:652">study note on 1Co 12:4</a>.) These miracles and gifts showed that the newly formed Christian congregation had God’s backing.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/13:11$p/E:1001070746/29-29:637">study note on 1Co 13:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:5-58:2:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>2:5</strong></a></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>the inhabited earth to come:</strong> With this expression, Paul is apparently referring to the future human society on earth under the rulership of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 37:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:5-40:5:5" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Mt 5:5</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/5:5$p/E:1001070605/17-17:807">study note;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2Pe 3:13</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:6-58:1:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb 1:6</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/1:6$p/E:1001070805/25-25:419">study note</a>.) Some scholars claim that in this verse, the Greek expression rendered “the inhabited earth” (lit., “the inhabited”) includes heaven. However, all other occurrences of this term in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> refer to either the whole earth or a part of the earth inhabited by humans. That is one reason why this expression is here rendered “the inhabited earth.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/2:1$p/E:1001070646/5-5:318">study notes on Lu 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/17:31$p/E:1001070706/32-32:324"> Ac 17:31</a>.) The Christian faith includes the hope for some humans to go to heaven (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:1-58:3:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb 3:1</a>), but this verse indicates that God’s original purpose of a paradise earth remains in place.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lu 23:43</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/23:43$p/E:1001070667/38-38:1156">study note</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>in one place a certain witness said:</strong> Paul does not identify either the author of the quotation or the Bible book where it is found. What mattered more to him​—as well as to his faithful readers​—was that Jehovah is the divine Author of this and other Bible prophecies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2Ti 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2Pe 1:21</a>) The quotation that follows is from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 8:4-6</a>, and Paul applies it to Jesus.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/2:9$p/E:1001070806/25-25:501">study note on Heb 2:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>You made him a little lower than angels:</strong> When King David wrote the words quoted here (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps 8:4-6</a>), he was comparing mankind with the mighty angels. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:5-19:8:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps 8:5</a>, ftn.) Humans are creatures of “blood and flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:14-58:2:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb 2:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:144:3-19:144:3" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a>) Angels are superior to humans because they are spirit creatures greater in power and ability. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:11-61:2:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2Pe 2:11</a>) Some Bibles convey the idea “You made him for a little while lower than the angels,” but the Hebrew text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:5-19:8:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps 8:5</a>, from which Paul quotes, does not convey such an idea.​—Regarding the application of this passage to Jesus, see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/2:9$p/E:1001070806/25-25:501">study note on Heb 2:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>you crowned him with glory and honor:</strong> Paul continues his quote from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:6" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps 8:4-6</a>. There David wrote that God created man with a measure of “glory and splendor” and gave humans dominion over the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ge 1:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:6-58:2:8" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Heb 2:6-8</a>) However, Paul shows that this passage also has a deeper meaning; it points prophetically to the one perfect man who descended from Adam, Jesus Christ. As the following verses show, Jesus would be crowned with even greater glory and honor because he was willing to give his perfect human life as a sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb 2:9</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/2:9$p/E:1001070806/25-25:501">study note</a>) By doing so, he would make it possible for obedient humans to regain the original glory and honor that God had bestowed on mankind.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/15:45$p/E:1001070748/63-63:1086">study note on 1Co 15:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:8-58:2:8" data-bid="33-1" class="b"><strong>2:8</strong></a></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="s5"><strong>All things you subjected under his feet:</strong> Paul here quotes from the latter part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:6-19:8:6" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps 8:6</a>. The passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:9" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps 8:4-9</a> can be applied to mortal man in general. But under inspiration, Paul explains several times that this psalm is actually a prophecy about the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:27-46:15:27" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1Co 15:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:22-49:1:22" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Eph 1:22</a>) The words Paul here quotes cannot fully apply to any imperfect human; only the first man Adam was given such authority over earthly creation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ge 1:28</a>) However, Adam failed in his assignment. Jehovah gave Jesus, “the Son of man,” great authority, confident that Christ would succeed where Adam had failed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Mt 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 28:18</a>) By sending his Son to become a human, Jehovah “made him a little lower than angels.” Ultimately, though, Jesus would become the Messianic King, who would have “all things . . . subjected under his feet.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:7-58:2:8" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Heb 2:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="40-1" class="b"><strong>2:9</strong></a></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>Jesus, who was made a little lower than angels:</strong> As explained in the <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070162/2:7$p/E:1001070806/21-21:718">study note on Heb 2:7</a>, Paul applies the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:4-19:8:6" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ps 8:4-6</a> to Jesus. When Jesus came to earth, he was indeed made “a little lower than angels”​—he became “a son of man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:6-58:2:6" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Heb 2:6</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/8:20$p/E:1001070608/34-34:414">study note on Mt 8:20</a>.) As a perfect human, he was a fitting counterpart to Adam. Jesus could thus give his perfect human life as a ransom sacrifice and thereby “taste death for everyone.”​—See also Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="60" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077296/">Son of man</a>,” and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:14$p/E:1001070669/27-27:388$p/E:1001070669/28-28:1269">study notes on Joh 1:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>he might taste death for everyone:</strong> The Greek expression rendered “he might taste” can literally mean eating or drinking a small amount. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:34-40:27:34" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Mt 27:34</a>) However, this expression is also used figuratively. In the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospels</a>, the expression “taste death” is used in the sense of experiencing death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:28-40:16:28" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Mt 16:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:1-41:9:1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Mr 9:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:27-42:9:27" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> Lu 9:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:52-43:8:52" data-bid="44-4" class="b"> Joh 8:52</a>) Jesus tasted death when he gave his life as a ransom. One reference work says that the expression “taste death” describes “the hard and painful reality of dying which is experienced by man and which was suffered also by Jesus.” Additionally, when Jesus was on earth, he witnessed firsthand the consequences of death among humans and felt the grief that afflicts those who lose loved ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:33-43:11:36" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Joh 11:33-36</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:10-58:2:10" data-bid="46-1" class="b"><strong>2:10</strong></a></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>For it was fitting:</strong> Jehovah saw it as fitting, or appropriate, for Jesus to suffer in order for him to become <strong>perfect</strong> in a special sense. The sufferings that he endured trained him further for the assignments that lay ahead of him. He thus became perfectly suited to serve as a sympathetic heavenly High Priest and the Messianic King. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:17" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Heb 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:15-58:4:15" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:8-58:5:9" data-bid="47-3" class="b"> 5:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:1-58:7:1" data-bid="47-4" class="b"> 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:17-58:7:17" data-bid="47-5" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:25-58:7:25" data-bid="47-6" class="b"> 25</a>) So there is no contradiction in saying that a sinless man could still be made perfect.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:22-60:2:22" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1Pe 2:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>the one for whom and through whom all things exist:</strong> This phrase must refer to Jehovah because He is the one who made Jesus “perfect through sufferings,” as this verse says. Jehovah alone is the Creator of the universe. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:36-45:11:36" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ro 11:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Re 4:11</a>.) Of course, expressions similar to this one are also applied to Jesus, who is “the image of the invisible God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Col 1:15</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Joh 1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:10-43:1:10" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:2-58:1:2" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> Heb 1:2</a>.) In his prehuman existence, the Son assisted Jehovah in all His creative works.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070155/1:16$p/E:1001070779/34-34:755">study note on Col 1:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>in bringing many sons to glory:</strong> At the time of Jesus’ baptism, Jehovah used holy spirit, or active force, to beget Jesus as His spirit-anointed Son. As a result, Jesus was “born again” with the hope of returning to life in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:3-43:3:3" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Joh 3:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:5-43:17:5" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 17:5</a>) He became the first of “many sons” to be brought to heavenly glory. Later, at Pentecost 33 C.E., God began bringing more of these “sons to glory” when through Jesus he anointed a group of disciples with holy spirit. They thus became sons of God, like Jesus.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ro 5:12</a>) Since then, Satan has caused death by deceiving and seducing humans in order to alienate them from God.

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="s5"><strong>set free:</strong> Or “emancipate.” By means of his death, Jesus was able to do something that no human priest could do​—bring to nothing the Devil, who is the one causing death.

Thus Jesus could liberate mankind from the paralyzing “fear of death” that held so many in slavery. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul foretold a coming victory over death and clearly stated that “the last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:54-46:15:57" data-bid="101-1" class="b">1Co 15:54-57</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/15:26$p/E:1001070748/38-38:771">study note on 1Co 15:26</a>.)

The basic meaning of the Greek verb translated “is assisting” is “to take hold of.” It may refer to taking a firm hold of someone in order to guide him through a perilous situation.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:9-58:8:9" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Heb 8:9</a>) The verb tense in this verse suggests that Christ comes to the aid of anointed Christians in an ongoing, lasting way.
