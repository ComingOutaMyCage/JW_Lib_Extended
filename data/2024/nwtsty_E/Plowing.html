<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Plowing was often done in the autumn when rains softened soil that had been baked hard by the sun during the hot summer months. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070237/">Appendix B15</a>.) Some plows consisted of a simple pointed piece of wood, perhaps metal-tipped, attached to a beam and pulled by one or more animals. After the soil was plowed, the seed was sown. In the Hebrew Scriptures, the familiar work of plowing was often alluded to in illustrations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:14:18-7:14:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 14:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:3-24:4:3" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Jer 4:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:3" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Mic 4:3</a>) Jesus frequently used agricultural activities to illustrate important teachings. For example, he referred to the work involved in plowing to emphasize the importance of being a wholehearted disciple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:62-42:9:62" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 9:62</a>) If a plowman became distracted from the work at hand, he would make crooked furrows. Similarly, a disciple of Christ who gets distracted or turns aside from carrying out his responsibilities becomes unfit for Godâ€™s Kingdom.</p>
