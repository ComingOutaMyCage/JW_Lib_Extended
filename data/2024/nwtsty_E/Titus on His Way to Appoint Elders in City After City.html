<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">On the island of Crete, Titus traveled from city to city to “make appointments of elders,” as Paul had instructed him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Tit 1:5</a>) Paul had left Titus on Crete to “correct the things that were defective” in the Christian congregations. Sometime later, Paul wrote an inspired letter to Titus. The letter apparently provided Titus with spiritual guidance and with apostolic backing to carry out his assignment in connection with the congregations in Crete. Among other things, the letter contains a list of qualities that Titus should look for in men who were under consideration for appointment as elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:6-56:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Tit 1:6-9</a>) The letter also contains counsel on the importance of “wholesome speech,” on the need to “maintain fine works,” as well as on how to deal with “rebellious men” in the congregation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:10-56:1:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Tit 1:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:13-56:1:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:8-56:2:8" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 2:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:14-56:3:14" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 3:14</a>.</p>
