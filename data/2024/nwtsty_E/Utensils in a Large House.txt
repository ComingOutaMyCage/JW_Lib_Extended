Utensils in a Large House




A house owned by a wealthy Roman family had many utensils. In the kitchen, slaves used pots and pans made of bronze or earthenware. They used larger earthenware jugs and amphoras to store such liquids as wine and olive oil. In the dining room, the Roman family used vessels made of colored glass, bronze, silver, or clay. The house also had vessels for a less honorable use, such as garbage containers and chamber pots. In the Bible, people are sometimes referred to as vessels in a figurative sense. (Ac 9:15) The apostle Paul compares the Christian congregation to “a large house” and individuals in the congregation to “utensils,” or household containers. Just as utensils that have “an honorable use” must be kept separate from utensils that have “a use lacking honor,” Christians must avoid associating closely with anyone in the congregation who would have an unclean influence on others.​—2Ti 2:20, 21.
