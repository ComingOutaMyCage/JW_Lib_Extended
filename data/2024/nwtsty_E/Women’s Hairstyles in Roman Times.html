<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In the first century, many women parted their long hair in the middle, pulled it back, and fashioned it into a bun (1). Some women wore more elaborate hairstyles, braiding and curling their hair (2). To produce curls, hair was wrapped around a calamistrum, a hollow rod that had been heated over coals. Wealthy women wore fancier styles and usually had their hair done by a slave. Elaborately arranged styles required hairpins, combs, ribbons, and hairnets to hold the hair in place. The apostles Paul and Peter advised Christian women against drawing attention to themselves with extravagant hairstyles. Rather, women were encouraged to “adorn themselves . . . with modesty” and a “quiet and mild spirit.” Such qualities are highly valued by Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1Ti 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Pe 3:3, 4</a>.</p>
