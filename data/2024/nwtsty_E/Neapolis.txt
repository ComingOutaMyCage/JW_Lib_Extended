Neapolis




This photograph shows the modern-day city of Kavála, which is built on the site of ancient Neapolis. Located at the northern end of the Aegean Sea, Neapolis served as the port for Philippi, a city that lay a short distance to the northwest. It was at Neapolis that the apostle Paul first entered Europe in response to the call to “step over into Macedonia.” (Ac 16:9, 11, 12) He likely passed through Neapolis again on his third missionary tour. (Ac 20:2, 6) There are few remains of the Roman city, but visitors today can travel on some segments of the Roman-built Egnatian Way (Via Egnatia) nearby. That highway was a major west-east route some 800 km (500 mi) long that helped to connect numerous cities in Europe and reached to the border of Asia. A number of the cities visited by Paul were on the Egnatian Way, including Neapolis, Philippi, Amphipolis, Apollonia, and Thessalonica.​—Ac 17:1.
