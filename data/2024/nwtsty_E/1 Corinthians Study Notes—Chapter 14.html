<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>encourages and consoles:</strong> The Greek words <em>pa·raʹkle·sis</em> (translated “encourages”) and <em>pa·ra·my·thiʹa</em> (translated “consoles”) both convey the idea of “encouragement,” but the word <em>pa·ra·my·thiʹa</em> denotes an even greater degree of tenderness and comfort. The related verb <em>pa·ra·my·theʹo·mai</em> is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:19-43:11:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 11:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:31-43:11:31" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31</a> regarding the Jews who went to console Mary and Martha after the death of their brother, Lazarus.​—See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Th 5:14</a>, where the verb is rendered “speak consolingly.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>interprets:</strong> Or “translates.” The Greek word is here used in the sense “to translate from one language to another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ac 9:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:30-46:12:30" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1Co 12:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:13-46:14:13" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 14:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:27-46:14:27" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 27</a>) However, it also signifies “to clarify the meaning; to explain fully.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/24:27$p/E:1001070668/28-28:277">study notes on Lu 24:27;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/12:10$p/E:1001070745/21-21:478"> 1Co 12:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s5"><strong>the inanimate things:</strong> Or “the lifeless things,” here used to describe musical instruments.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:8-46:14:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>14:8</strong></a></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>trumpet:</strong> The Mosaic Law directed the Israelite priests to use trumpet blasts to signify important announcements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:2-4:10:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nu 10:2-10</a>) For example, when it was time to go into battle, the trumpets sounded a war call. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:9-4:10:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Nu 10:9</a>) If a soldier heard an indistinct trumpet call, he might not know just how to respond. Likewise, in the congregation, vague direction or indistinct communication could cause confusion, disorder, and discouragement.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>interpret:</strong> Or “translate.”​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/14:5$p/E:1001070747/10-10:257">study note on 1Co 14:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>with my mind:</strong> Or “with my understanding.” In this verse, the Greek word <em>nous</em> (often rendered “mind”) is used twice. It is also used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:14-46:14:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1Co 14:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:19-46:14:19" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>say “Amen” to your giving of thanks:</strong> The Greek word <em>a·menʹ</em> is a <a class="xt" data-xtid="49" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077388/">transliteration</a> of the Hebrew <em>ʼa·menʹ,</em> meaning “so be it,” or “surely.” A number of scriptures indicate that those listening to a public prayer said amen at the end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:36-13:16:36" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1Ch 16:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:13-16:5:13" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ne 5:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:6-16:8:6" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 8:6</a>) Paul’s statement shows that those in Christian assembly apparently continued to follow this pattern and joined in the amen to a prayer. However, Paul did not say specifically whether their amen was audible or silent, in their hearts.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="151" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077015/">Amen</a>,” and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/1:25$p/E:1001070718/55-55:647">study note on Ro 1:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>with my mind:</strong> Or “with my understanding.” The Greek word <em>nous</em> used here refers to the ability to think and comprehend. Under inspiration, Paul ranked speaking in tongues as a lesser gift, stating that he would rather speak five words that he and others understood than ten thousand words in a tongue, or language, that were not understood.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:11-46:14:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1Co 14:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:13-46:14:18" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 13-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>instruct others:</strong> Or “instruct others orally.” The Greek verb <em>ka·te·kheʹo</em> literally means “to sound down,” and it may include the idea of oral instruction.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/18:25$p/E:1001070707/31-31:311">study note on Ac 18:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>become young children:</strong> Paul first urges the Corinthians not to become young children, that is, immature or childish, in their understanding of spiritual matters. But he does urge them to “be young children,” that is, childlike, inexperienced, and innocent, “as to badness.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:21-46:14:21" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>14:21</strong></a></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>In the Law it is written:</strong> The quote that follows is taken from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:11-23:28:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa 28:11, 12</a>, so the term “Law” is here used in a broad sense, referring to the entire Hebrew Scriptures.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/10:34$p/E:1001070678/31-31:188">study notes on Joh 10:34;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/2:12$p/E:1001070719/13-13:603"> Ro 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>says Jehovah:</strong> Paul here quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:11-23:28:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa 28:11, 12</a> to show that God would speak to people “with the tongues of foreigners,” but they would refuse to listen. Though Isaiah’s prophecy says that “he [God] will speak,” Paul quotes these words as spoken by God in the first person: “I will speak.” To clarify who made this statement, Paul adds a phrase that occurs hundreds of times in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> to translate Hebrew phrases for “declares Jehovah,” “says Jehovah,” and “this is what Jehovah says.” Some examples are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:11-23:1:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:25-23:22:25" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 22:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:16-23:28:16" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 28:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:1-23:30:1" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 30:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:9-23:31:9" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 31:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:10-23:33:10" data-bid="24-6" class="b"> 33:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="24-7" class="b"> 43:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="24-8" class="b"> 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:18-23:49:18" data-bid="24-9" class="b"> 49:18</a> (quoted at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:11-45:14:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ro 14:11</a>); <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:4-23:52:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">52:4, 5;</a> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:5-30:1:5" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Am 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:2:3-33:2:3" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Mic 2:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:12-34:1:12" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Na 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:2-39:1:2" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Mal 1:2</a>. So for the reasons mentioned in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C</a>, the Hebrew Scripture background strongly suggests that the divine name was originally used in this verse and was later replaced with the title Lord.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070243/3-6">App. C3 introduction;</a> <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001079346/54-60">1Co 14:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>an unbeliever or an ordinary person comes in:</strong> Besides “believers,” that is, those who had accepted Christ and been baptized (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:13-44:8:13" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ac 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:31-44:16:34" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 16:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:8-44:18:8" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 18:8</a>), “unbelievers” were also welcome to attend Christian meetings (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:22-46:14:22" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1Co 14:22</a>). “An unbeliever” (Greek, <em>aʹpi·stos</em>) and “an ordinary person” (Greek, <em>i·di·oʹtes</em>) who attended these meetings no doubt progressed in studying and applying God’s Word at varying rates. Yet, they benefited by hearing truths that reproved them, or caused the secrets of their heart to “become evident.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:23-46:14:25" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1Co 14:23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:14" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 2Co 6:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5"><strong>a God not of disorder but of peace:</strong> Paul here contrasts disorder with peace. He describes Jehovah as “the God of peace” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:9-50:4:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Php 4:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:23-52:5:23" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 1Th 5:23</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:20-58:13:20" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Heb 13:20</a> and as “the God who gives peace” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:33-45:15:33" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ro 15:33</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="40-1" class="b">16:20</a>. God-given peace forms the foundation for order and unity in the Christian congregation. Paul was not implying that doing things in an organized way would, in itself, result in peace. Rather, by conducting their worship in an orderly manner, the Corinthians would enjoy meetings in a peaceful environment that would serve “for building up,” so that “all may be encouraged.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:26-46:14:32" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1Co 14:26-32</a>) Orderly meetings of worship would reflect the qualities and character of the God of peace, bringing him honor.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="s5"><strong>let the women keep silent in the congregations:</strong> Paul has already given the direction to “keep silent” to those speaking in tongues without an interpreter and to those prophesying while another receives a revelation. In this context, he gives direction to women who were speaking out of turn during the congregation meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:28-46:14:28" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1Co 14:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:30-46:14:30" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:34-46:14:34" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 34</a>) Perhaps some women were interrupting or challenging the men who took the lead in teaching. Paul encouraged those women who had questions or concerns to “ask their husbands at home” rather than disrupt the meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:35-46:14:35" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1Co 14:35</a>) Additionally, Paul is here inspired to uphold the Scriptural direction that God assigns men to handle the oversight positions among his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:12-54:2:12" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1Ti 2:12</a>) The apostle left no doubt that he greatly valued women as fellow ministers or preachers of the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:1-45:16:2" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ro 16:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:2-50:4:3" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Php 4:2, 3</a>) His inspired direction did not exclude women from participating in congregation meetings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:5-46:11:5" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1Co 11:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:25" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Heb 10:23-25</a>.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>Was it from you that the word of God originated . . . ?:</strong> Paul asked the <a class="xt" data-xtid="57" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077370/">rhetorical question</a> here to remind the Corinthians that theirs was not the first congregation to be formed; nor had “the word of God” been declared to them alone. They were part of a large association of believers. Rather than introduce new ways of doing things in the congregation, they were to follow the direction of the apostles. Doing so would promote orderliness, unity, and spiritual growth.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="s5"><strong>is gifted with the spirit:</strong> All Christians may ask for and receive guidance and help from the holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Lu 11:13</a>) Also, Christians with the heavenly calling are anointed with holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2Co 1:21, 22</a>) However, this expression applies to one who had received a special, miraculous gift of the holy spirit. The expression is translated from the Greek word <em>pneu·ma·ti·kosʹ,</em> which has the basic sense of “pertaining to the spirit; spiritual.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:1-46:14:1" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1Co 14:1</a>, it is translated “spiritual gifts.” Here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:37-46:14:37" data-bid="53-1" class="b">1Co 14:37</a>, near the close of his discussion of miraculous gifts, Paul mentions both prophesying and being “gifted with the spirit,” indicating, as in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:1-46:14:1" data-bid="54-1" class="b">verse 1</a>, that he is still referring to miraculous gifts of the holy spirit.</p>
