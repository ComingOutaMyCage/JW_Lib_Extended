Scorpions




Of the over 600 varieties of scorpions, generally ranging in size from less than 2.5 cm (1 in.) to 20 cm (8 in.), about a dozen types have been encountered in Israel and Syria. Although the scorpion’s sting is usually not fatal to humans, there are several varieties with venom that is proportionately more potent than that of many dangerous desert vipers. Of the kinds found in Israel, the most poisonous is the yellow Leiurus quinquestriatus (shown here). The great pain caused by a scorpion’s sting is noted at Re 9:3, 5, 10. Scorpions were common in the wilderness of Judea and on the Sinai Peninsula with its “fearsome wilderness.”—De 8:15.
