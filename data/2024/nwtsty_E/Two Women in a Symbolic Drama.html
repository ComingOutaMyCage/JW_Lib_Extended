<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">In his letter to the Christians in Galatia, Paul mentions “a symbolic drama” in which Abraham’s wife, Sarah, and his secondary wife, Hagar, play special roles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:24-48:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ga 4:24</a>) Paul writes that Hagar, a slave, corresponds to “the Jerusalem today,” the capital of natural Israel in Paul’s day. Hagar’s offspring pictures Jews who choose to remain bound to the Mosaic Law and its system of animal sacrifices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:25-48:4:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ga 4:25</a>) Sarah, a free woman, represents “the Jerusalem above,” God’s symbolic woman, his heavenly, wifelike organization of spirit creatures. She also produces symbolic offspring, Christ and his spirit-anointed brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ga 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:28-48:3:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:26-48:4:26" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 4:26</a>) Jesus’ brothers and their associates render worship to Jehovah by their Christian way of life, including making public declaration to his name and gathering at congregation meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb 10:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:25-58:10:25" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 13:15</a>) In the book of Galatians, Paul shows that the only way worshippers of God can be truly free is by faithfully following Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:1-48:5:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ga 5:1</a>.</p>
