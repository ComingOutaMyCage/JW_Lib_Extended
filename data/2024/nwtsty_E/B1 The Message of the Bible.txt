The Message of the Bible

Jehovah God has the right to rule. His method of ruling is best. His purpose for the earth and for mankind will be fulfilled.









After 4026 B.C.E.
“The serpent” questions Jehovah’s right to rule and his way of ruling. Jehovah promises to raise up an “offspring,” or a “seed,” who will eventually crush the serpent, Satan. (Genesis 3:1-5, 15, footnote) However, Jehovah allows time for humans to rule themselves under the serpent’s influence.







1943 B.C.E.
Jehovah tells Abraham that the promised “offspring” will be one of his descendants.—Genesis 22:18.







After 1070 B.C.E.
Jehovah assures King David and later his son Solomon that the promised “offspring” would come through their family line.—2 Samuel 7:12, 16; 1 Kings 9:3-5; Isaiah 9:6, 7.







29 C.E.
Jehovah identifies Jesus as the promised “offspring” who is the Heir to David’s throne.—Galatians 3:16; Luke 1:31-33; 3:21, 22.







33 C.E.
The serpent, Satan, briefly cripples the promised “offspring” by having Jesus killed. Jehovah raises Jesus to life in heaven and accepts the value of Jesus’ perfect life, thus providing the basis to forgive sins and to give Adam’s descendants everlasting life.—Genesis 3:15; Acts 2:32-36; 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22.







About 1914 C.E.
Jesus hurls the serpent, Satan, to the earth, confining him there for a short time.—Revelation 12:7-9, 12.







Future
Jesus imprisons Satan for 1,000 years and then destroys him, symbolically crushing his head. Jehovah’s original purpose for the earth and for mankind is fulfilled, his name is cleared of reproach, and his way of ruling is vindicated.—Revelation 20:1-3, 10; 21:3, 4.
