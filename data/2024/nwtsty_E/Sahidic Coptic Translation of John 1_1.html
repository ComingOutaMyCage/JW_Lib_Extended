Coptic was spoken in Egypt in the centuries immediately following Jesus’ earthly ministry. Along with Syriac and <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a>, Coptic was one of the first languages into which the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> were translated. Translations into Coptic were available by the third century C.E., so they can give us insight into how the Greek text was understood at that time. This may be of special interest when it comes to the much debated second part of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 1:1</a>, which in many translations reads: “And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Unlike Koine Greek, Syriac, and Latin, the Sahidic Coptic dialect does have an indefinite article (in some ways corresponding to “a” and “an” in English). As shown here, the two occurrences of the Coptic word for “God” (highlighted) look slightly different—the first one (1) with the <a class="xt" data-xtid="36" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077363/">definite article</a> (circled in red) and the second one (2) with the indefinite article (circled in red). Thus, when rendered literally into English, the translation would read: “And the Word was with <strong>the</strong> God, and the Word was <strong>a</strong> god.”—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:1$p/E:1001070669/10-10:2796">study note on Joh 1:1</a> for more information regarding the rendering “and the Word was a god.”</p>
