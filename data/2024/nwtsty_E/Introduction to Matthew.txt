Noteworthy Facts:

  Evidence indicates that Matthew originally wrote his Gospel in Hebrew just eight years after Jesus’ death; he may personally have translated it into Greek.

  It has been estimated that Matthew’s Gospel contains about a hundred references to the Hebrew Scriptures. Some 40 of these are actual quotations.

  Matthew’s account of Jesus’ life was likely written primarily with the Jewish audience in mind.

  Matthew had been a tax collector, which may explain why he was explicit in his mention of money, figures, and values. (17:27; 26:15; 27:3)

  Matthew alone mentions Jesus’ repeated insistence that mercy is required in addition to sacrifice. (9:9-13; 12:7; 18:21-35)

  Matthew uses the term “Kingdom” more than 50 times.

  In the first 18 chapters, Matthew highlights the Kingdom theme, leading him to depart from a chronological arrangement. However, the last ten chapters (19 to 28) generally follow a chronological sequence.

  Over 40 percent of Matthew’s Gospel account is not found in any other Gospel. This includes at least ten illustrations: the weeds in the field (13:24-30), the hidden treasure (13:44), the pearl of high value (13:45, 46), the dragnet (13:47-50), the unmerciful slave (18:23-35), the workers and the denarius (20:1-16), the father and two children (21:28-32), the marriage of the king’s son (22:1-14), the ten virgins (25:1-13), and the talents (25:14-30).
