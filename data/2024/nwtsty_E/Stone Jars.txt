Stone Jars




Shown here are stone jars from first-century Jerusalem. Although jars were usually earthenware (Isa 30:14; La 4:2), in connection with the wedding at Cana, the Bible mentions jars made of stone. (Joh 2:6) Quite a few stone vessels have been found in Jerusalem. It has been suggested that stone vessels were commonly used because they were not considered susceptible to ceremonial defilement in contrast with vessels made of other materials, such as clay. (Le 11:33) This may explain why the apostle John mentions the connection between the stone vessels used to store the water and “the purification rules of the Jews.”
