<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">The artifacts shown in the photo (left) are just some of the medical equipment used by physicians in Roman times. Some physicians worked with high-quality tools like scalpels, scissors, and forceps. They also used medicines from plant matter, including antiseptic substances like wine and vinegar. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:34-42:10:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 10:34</a>.) Medical practices were not regulated by the State. While some physicians were professionals​—skilled at treating diseases or performing surgery​—others fraudulently pretended to be doctors. A physician’s income and social standing may have been determined by his patients. Some doctors worked exclusively for a wealthy person or family. Others were doctors for a village, a city, or a military hospital. Some physicians worked at home, whereas others visited patients in their homes. “The beloved physician” Luke traveled with Paul during some of the apostle’s missionary journeys.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:14-51:4:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col 4:14</a>.</p>
