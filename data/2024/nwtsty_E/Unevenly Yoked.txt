Unevenly Yoked




This illustration shows a bull and a donkey yoked together for work. The Mosaic Law did not allow such a practice. Bulls were far stronger than donkeys, so the animals would cause each other discomfort when they pulled a plow or hauled a load. (De 22:10; Pr 12:10) Paul used this practice as a word picture when he wrote that Christians should “not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.”​—2Co 6:14.
