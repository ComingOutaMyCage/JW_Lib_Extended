Jesus Heals a Woman




The frightened woman gazes up at Jesus. Trembling, she confesses to touching Jesus’ garment in order to be healed of an illness she has suffered from for 12 years. Jesus does not condemn her; rather, he kindly says: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” (Lu 8:48) Jesus performed this miracle while on his way to heal Jairus’ daughter. (Lu 8:41, 42) These miracles show that Jesus has the power to heal all kinds of illnesses and that when he rules over mankind, none of his subjects will say: “I am sick.”​—Isa 33:24.
