The Theater and Surroundings in Ephesus




The theater shown in this video could hold 25,000 people, making it the largest theater in Asia Minor in Paul’s day. Located at the intersection of two of the principal thoroughfares in Ephesus, the theater was a prominent part of life in that city. Roman theaters were used not only for theatrical performances but also for hosting debates. It was into this theater that a mob dragged Paul’s traveling companions when the silversmith Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen stirred up a riot against Paul.—Ac 19:23-29.
