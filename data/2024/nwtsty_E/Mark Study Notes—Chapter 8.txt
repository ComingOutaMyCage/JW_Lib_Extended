MARK
Study Notes​—Chapter 8

8:2
feel pity: Or “feel compassion.”​—See study note on Mt 9:36.
8:8
large baskets: Or “provision baskets.” The Greek word sphy·risʹ used here seems to denote a type of basket that is larger than the ones used on an earlier occasion when Jesus fed about 5,000 men. (See study note on Mr 6:43.) The same Greek word is used for the “basket” in which Paul was lowered to the ground through an opening in the wall of Damascus.​—See study note on Ac 9:25.
8:9
about 4,000 men: Only Matthew’s parallel account (Mt 15:38) mentions the women and the young children when reporting this miracle. It is possible that the total number of those miraculously fed was over 12,000.
8:10
Dalmanutha: This name is not mentioned in other Biblical or non-Biblical sources, but it was preserved in Mark’s Gospel. Though the exact location is uncertain, it seems to have been near the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, since the area is called Magadan in Matthew’s parallel account. (See study note on Mt 15:39.) Dalmanutha may have been another name for Magadan.
8:12
sighed deeply: Mark, who frequently records how Jesus felt and reacted (Mr 3:5; 7:34; 9:36; 10:13-16, 21), uses a verb found only here in the Christian Greek Scriptures. This intensive form of a related verb, used at Mr 7:34 (see study note), expresses a strong emotional reaction. This deep sigh may have reflected his exasperation over the Pharisees’ demand for a sign while they stubbornly ignored the evident demonstrations of power that they had already seen.
8:15
leaven: Or “yeast.” Often used figuratively in the Bible to denote corruption and sin, “leaven” here refers to corrupt teaching and influence. (Mt 16:6, 11, 12; 1Co 5:6-8) The repetition of the word in this verse suggests that “the leaven” of the Pharisees was different from that of Herod and his party followers, the Herodians. This latter group was more political than religious. An example of their nationalistic “leaven” was the question about the paying of taxes that the two groups used in an attempt to trap Jesus.​—Mr 12:13-15.
Herod: Some ancient manuscripts read “Herodians.”​—See Glossary, “Herod, party followers of.”
8:19
baskets: Reporting on the two occasions when Jesus miraculously fed the crowds (see study notes on Mr 6:43; 8:8, 20 and parallel accounts at Mt 14:20; 15:37; 16:9, 10), the accounts consistently distinguish between the types of baskets used for collecting leftovers. When he fed the 5,000 men, the Greek term koʹphi·nos (“basket”) is used; when he fed the 4,000 men, the Greek word sphy·risʹ (“large basket”) is used. This indicates that the writers were present or had received the facts from reliable eyewitnesses.
8:20
large baskets: Or “provision baskets.”​—See study notes on Mr 8:8, 19.
8:22
a blind man: Mark is the only Gospel writer to record Jesus’ healing of this blind man.​—Mr 8:22-26.
8:27
Caesarea Philippi: See study note on Mt 16:13.
8:28
John the Baptist: See study notes on Mt 3:1; Mr 1:4.
Elijah: See study note on Mt 11:14.
8:29
the Christ: See study note on Mt 16:16.
8:31
Son of man: See study note on Mt 8:20.
elders: Lit., “older men.” In the Bible, the Greek term pre·sbyʹte·ros refers primarily to those who hold a position of authority and responsibility in a community or a nation. Although the term sometimes refers to physical age (as at Lu 15:25; Ac 2:17), it is not limited to those who are elderly. Here it refers to the leaders of the Jewish nation, who are often mentioned together with chief priests and scribes. The Sanhedrin was made up of men from these three groups.​—Mr 11:27; 14:43, 53; 15:1; see study note on Mt 16:21 and Glossary, “Elder; Older man.”
chief priests: See study note on Mt 2:4 and Glossary, “Chief priest.”
scribes: See study note on Mt 2:4 and Glossary, “Scribe.”
8:33
Get behind me: According to the parallel account at Mt 16:23, Jesus adds: “You are a stumbling block to me.” (See study note on Mt 18:7.) Jesus thus strongly rebuked Peter. Jesus refused to allow anything to hinder him from fulfilling his Father’s will. His words may also have reminded Peter of his proper place as a supportive follower of his Master.
Satan: See study note on Mt 16:23.
8:34
come after me: Or, according to some ancient manuscripts, “follow after me.”
let him disown himself: Or “let him give up all right to himself.” This indicates a person’s willingness to deny himself utterly or to relinquish ownership of himself to God. The Greek phrase can be rendered “he must say no to himself,” which is fitting because it may involve saying no to personal desires, ambitions, or convenience. (2Co 5:14, 15) The same Greek verb is used by Mark when describing Peter’s denial of Jesus.​—Mr 14:30, 31, 72.
torture stake: See study note on Mt 16:24.
8:35
life: Or “soul.”​—See Glossary, “Soul.”
8:36
life: Or “soul.”​—See Glossary, “Soul.”
8:37
life: Or “soul.”​—See Glossary, “Soul.”
8:38
adulterous: Or “unfaithful.” In a spiritual sense, adultery denotes unfaithfulness to God on the part of those who are joined to him in a covenant. The false religious practices of natural Israel were a violation of the Law covenant, making the Israelites guilty of spiritual adultery. (Jer 3:8, 9; 5:7, 8; 9:2; 13:27; 23:10; Ho 7:4) For similar reasons, Jesus denounced as adulterous the generation of Jews in his day. (Mt 12:39; 16:4) If Christians who are in the new covenant defile themselves with the present system of things, they commit spiritual adultery. In principle, this would be true of all those who are dedicated to Jehovah.​—Jas 4:4.
