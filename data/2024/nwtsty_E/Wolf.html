(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:8-35:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hab 1:8</a>) Wolves are fierce, voracious, bold, and greedy, frequently killing more sheep than they can eat or drag away. In the Bible, animals and their characteristics and habits are often applied in a figurative sense, picturing both desirable and undesirable traits. For example, in Jacob’s deathbed prophecy, the tribe of Benjamin is described figuratively as a fighter like a wolf. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:27-1:49:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 49:27</a>) But in most occurrences, the wolf is used to picture such undesirable qualities as ferocity, greed, viciousness, and craftiness. Those compared to wolves include false prophets (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:15-40:7:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 7:15</a>), vicious opposers of the Christian ministry (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:3-42:10:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Lu 10:3</a>), and false teachers who would endanger the Christian congregation from within (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 20:29, 30</a>). Shepherds were well-aware of the danger posed by wolves. Jesus spoke of “the hired man” who “sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees.” Unlike the hired man, who “does not care for the sheep,” Jesus is “the fine shepherd,” who surrendered “his life in behalf of the sheep.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:11-43:10:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joh 10:11-13</a>.</p>
