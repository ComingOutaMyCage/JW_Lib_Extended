The Tent




The arrangement for worship at the sacred tent, or tabernacle, in ancient Israel “is an illustration.” (Heb 9:9) By means of this arrangement, Jehovah revealed that he would forgive the sins of mankind on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. For example, at the tabernacle on the Day of Atonement, the high priest performed a ceremony that had great symbolic meaning. (Heb 9:6, 7) From this video, learn how some of the features of that ceremony pointed to activities that Jesus would perform as “a great high priest.”​—Heb 4:14.
