When he fed about 5,000, the Greek term <em>koʹphi·nos</em> (rendered “basket”) is used; when he fed the 4,000, the Greek word <em>sphy·risʹ</em> (rendered “large basket”) is used. This indicates that the writers were present or had received the facts from reliable eyewitnesses.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s5"><strong>Caesarea Philippi:</strong> A town situated at the headwaters of the Jordan River at an elevation of 350 m (1,150 ft) above sea level. The town is some 40 km (25 mi) N of the Sea of Galilee and near the SW foot of Mount Hermon. It was named Caesarea by Philip the <a class="xt" data-xtid="74" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077387/">tetrarch</a>, son of Herod the Great, in honor of the Roman emperor. In order to distinguish it from the seaport city of the same name, it was called Caesarea Philippi, which means “Caesarea of Philip.”​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070230/">App. B10</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>the Christ:</strong> Peter identifies Jesus as “the Christ” (Greek, <em>ho Khri·stosʹ</em>), a title equivalent to “the Messiah” (from Hebrew <em>ma·shiʹach</em>), both meaning “Anointed One.” Here “Christ” is preceded by the <a class="xt" data-xtid="36" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077363/">definite article</a> in Greek, evidently as a way of emphasizing Jesus’ office as the Messiah.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/1:1$p/E:1001070601/9-9:215">study notes on Mt 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/2:4$p/E:1001070602/14-14:144"> 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="s5"><strong>the living God:</strong> An expression used to highlight that Jehovah is alive and active in contrast with the lifeless gods of the nations (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:15-44:14:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ac 14:15</a>), such as the gods worshipped in the region of Caesarea Philippi (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:13-40:16:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mt 16:13</a>). This term also occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:5:26-5:5:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">De 5:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:10-24:10:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Jer 10:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s5"><strong>son of Jonah:</strong> Or “Bar-jonah.” Many Hebrew names included the Hebrew word <em>ben</em> or the Aramaic word <em>bar,</em> both meaning “son,” followed by the name of the father as a surname. The use of the Aramaic loanword <em>bar</em> in several proper names, such as Bartholomew, Bartimaeus, Barnabas, and Bar-Jesus, is evidence of the influence of Aramaic on the Hebrew spoken in Jesus’ day.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>flesh and blood:</strong> Or “a human,” a common Jewish expression. In this context, it evidently refers to fleshly or human thinking.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:16-48:1:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ga 1:16</a>, ftn.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>You are Peter, and on this rock:</strong> The Greek word <em>peʹtros</em> in the masculine gender means “a piece of rock; a stone.” Here it is used as a proper name (Peter), the Greek form of the name Jesus gave Simon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:42-43:1:42" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Joh 1:42</a>) The feminine form <em>peʹtra</em> is rendered “rock,” and it may denote bedrock, a cliff, or a mass of rock. This Greek word also occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:25" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mt 7:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:60-40:27:60" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 27:60;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:48-42:6:48" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Lu 6:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:6-42:8:6" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:33-45:9:33" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> Ro 9:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:4-46:10:4" data-bid="21-6" class="b"> 1Co 10:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:8-60:2:8" data-bid="21-7" class="b"> 1Pe 2:8</a>. Peter evidently did not view himself as the rock on which Jesus would build his congregation, since he wrote at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:4-60:2:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1Pe 2:4-8</a> that Jesus was the long-foretold “foundation cornerstone,” chosen by God himself. Similarly, the apostle Paul referred to Jesus as the “foundation” and “the spiritual rock.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:11-46:3:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1Co 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:4-46:10:4" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 10:4</a>) So Jesus was evidently using a play on words, saying in effect: ‘You, the one I called Peter, a Piece of Rock, have discerned the true identity of the Christ, “this rock,” the one who will serve as the foundation of the Christian congregation.’</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>congregation:</strong> This is the first occurrence of the Greek term <em>ek·kle·siʹa.</em> It comes from two Greek words, <em>ek,</em> meaning “out,” and <em>ka·leʹo,</em> meaning “to call.” It refers to a group of people summoned or called together for a particular purpose or activity. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="77" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077066/">Glossary</a>.) In this context, Jesus foretells the formation of the Christian congregation, made up of anointed Christians, who as “living stones” are being “built up into a spiritual house.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:4-60:2:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1Pe 2:4, 5</a>) This Greek term is frequently used in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> as an equivalent of the Hebrew term rendered “congregation,” which often refers to the entire nation of God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:3-5:23:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">De 23:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:30-5:31:30" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 31:30</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:38-44:7:38" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ac 7:38</a>, the Israelites who were called out of Egypt are referred to as a “congregation.” Similarly, Christians who are “called . . . out of darkness” and “chosen . . . out of the world” make up “the congregation of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1Pe 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Joh 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:2-46:1:2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 1Co 1:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s5"><strong>the Grave:</strong> Or “Hades,” that is, the common grave of mankind. (See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077125/">Grave</a>.”) The Bible speaks of the dead as being within “the gates of death” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:18-19:107:18" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps 107:18</a>) and “the gates of the Grave” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:38:10-23:38:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa 38:10</a>), that is, subject to the power of death. Jesus promises victory over the Grave, meaning that “the gates” of the Grave will open to release the dead by means of a resurrection. His own resurrection confirmed the truthfulness of his promise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:21-40:16:21" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mt 16:21</a>) Because the congregation is built on Jesus, the one who can release its members from death, it cannot be overpowered by or permanently restrained by the Grave.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:31-44:2:31" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ac 2:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:18-66:1:18" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Re 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:13-66:20:14" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 20:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>keys of the Kingdom of the heavens:</strong> In the Bible, those who were given certain keys, whether literal or figurative, were entrusted with a degree of authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:9:26-13:9:27" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1Ch 9:26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:20-23:22:22" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Isa 22:20-22</a>) So the term “key” came to symbolize authority and responsibility. Peter used these “keys” entrusted to him to open up for Jews (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:22-44:2:41" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ac 2:22-41</a>), Samaritans (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ac 8:14-17</a>), and Gentiles (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:38" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ac 10:34-38</a>) the opportunity to receive God’s spirit with a view to their entering the heavenly Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="s5"><strong>bind . . . loosen:</strong> Or “lock . . . unlock.” Evidently referring to decisions forbidding or allowing certain actions or developments.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/18:18$p/E:1001070618/26-26:335">study note on Mt 18:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5"><strong>will already be bound . . . will already be loosened:</strong> The unusual construction of Greek verbs here (future form of “to be” combined with perfect passive participle of “bind” and “loosen”) indicates that whatever decision Peter made (“whatever you may bind”; “whatever you may loosen”) would be made after the corresponding decision was made in heaven; it would not precede it.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/18:18$p/E:1001070618/27-27:909">study note on Mt 18:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="s5"><strong>elders:</strong> Lit., “older men.” In the Bible, the Greek term <em>pre·sbyʹte·ros</em> refers primarily to those who hold a position of authority and responsibility in a community or a nation. Although the term sometimes refers to physical age (as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:25-42:15:25" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Lu 15:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:17-44:2:17" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Ac 2:17</a>), it is not limited to those who are elderly. Here it refers to the leaders of the Jewish nation who are often mentioned together with chief priests and scribes. The Sanhedrin was made up of men from these three groups.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:23-40:21:23" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mt 21:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:3-40:26:3" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:47-40:26:47" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 47,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:57-40:26:57" data-bid="40-4" class="b"> 57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:1-40:27:1" data-bid="40-5" class="b"> 27:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:41-40:27:41" data-bid="40-6" class="b"> 41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:12-40:28:12" data-bid="40-7" class="b"> 28:12</a>; see Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="78" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077089/">Elder; Older man</a>.”</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="s5"><strong>Get behind me:</strong> Jesus here strongly “rebuked” Peter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:8:33-41:8:33" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Mr 8:33</a>) Jesus refused to allow anything to hinder him from fulfilling his Father’s will. Some lexicons define this <a class="xt" data-xtid="48" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077368/">idiom</a> as: “Get out of my sight!” and some Bible translations render it: “Get away from me.” His words may also have reminded Peter of his proper place as a supportive follower of his Master; he was not to be a <strong>stumbling block,</strong> that is, an obstacle in Jesus’ path.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>Satan:</strong> Jesus was not identifying Peter with Satan the Devil but was referring to him as a resister, or opposer, which is the meaning of the Hebrew expression <em>sa·tanʹ.</em> Jesus may have implied that Peter, by his action on this occasion, had allowed himself to be influenced by Satan.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="s5"><strong>stumbling block:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/18:7$p/E:1001070618/8-8:594">study note on Mt 18:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="s5"><strong>let him disown himself:</strong> Or “let him give up all right to himself.” This indicates a person’s willingness to deny himself utterly or to relinquish ownership of himself to God. The Greek phrase can be rendered “he must say no to himself,” which is fitting because it may involve saying no to personal desires, ambitions, or convenience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Co 5:14, 15</a>) The same Greek verb is used by Matthew when describing Peter’s denial that he knew Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:34-40:26:35" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Mt 26:34, 35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:75-40:26:75" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 75</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="s5"><strong>torture stake:</strong> Or “execution stake.” In classical Greek, the word <em>stau·rosʹ</em> primarily referred to an upright stake or pole.
