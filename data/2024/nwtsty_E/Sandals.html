<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">In Bible times, sandals consisted of flat soles made of leather, wood, or other fibrous material strapped to the foot by leather laces. Sandals were used as symbols in some types of transactions and as a word picture. For example, a widow under the Law removed a sandal from the man who refused to perform brother-in-law marriage with her, and his name was reproachfully called “The house of the one who had his sandal removed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:25:9-5:25:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">De 25:9, 10</a>) The transfer of property or of right of repurchase was represented by a person’s handing his sandal to another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:7-8:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ru 4:7</a>) To untie another’s sandal laces or to carry his sandals was considered a menial task often done by slaves. John the Baptist referred to this practice to denote his inferiority to the Christ.</p>
