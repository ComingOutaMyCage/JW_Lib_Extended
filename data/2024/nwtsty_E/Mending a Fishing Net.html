<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="se">Fishing nets were expensive, and maintaining them required hard work. Much of a fisherman’s time was spent mending, washing, and drying nets​—chores he did at the end of every fishing trip. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:2-42:5:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 5:2</a>) Matthew used three Greek terms to describe fishing nets. The general term, <em>diʹkty·on,</em> can evidently embrace various types of nets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:21-40:4:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 4:21</a>) The term <em>sa·geʹne</em> refers to a large dragnet that was let down from a boat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:47-40:13:48" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 13:47, 48</a>) A smaller net, <em>am·phiʹble·stron,</em> which means “something thrown,” was evidently cast into shallow water by fishermen who were on or near the shore.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:18-40:4:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 4:18</a>.</p>
