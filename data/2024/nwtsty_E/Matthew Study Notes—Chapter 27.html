<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Pilate, the governor:</strong> The Roman governor (prefect) of Judea appointed by Emperor Tiberius in 26 C.E. His rule lasted about ten years. Pilate is mentioned by non-Biblical writers, including Roman historian <a class="xt" data-xtid="101" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077385/">Tacitus</a>, who wrote that Pilate ordered the execution of Christ during the reign of Tiberius. A <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a> inscription with the words “Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea” was found in the ancient Roman theater in Caesarea, Israel.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070230/">App. B10</a> for the domain ruled by Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:3-40:27:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>27:3</strong></a></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>felt remorse:</strong> While the Greek word <em>me·ta·meʹlo·mai</em> used here can have positive connotations (rendered “feel regret” or “regret” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:29-40:21:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 21:29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:32-40:21:32" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:8-47:7:8" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2Co 7:8</a>), there is no indication that Judas was truly repentant. When referring to repentance before God, the Bible uses a different term, <em>me·ta·no·eʹo</em> (rendered “repent” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:2-40:3:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mt 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:7-42:15:7" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Lu 15:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Ac 3:19</a>), which signifies a strong change in thinking, attitude, or purpose. Judas’ actions of returning to the very men he had conspired with and then committing suicide show that his thinking remained distorted, not changed for the better.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:4-40:27:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>27:4</strong></a></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>innocent:</strong> Some ancient <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> read “righteous.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:35-40:23:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mt 23:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:5-40:27:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>27:5</strong></a></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>temple:</strong> The Greek word <em>na·osʹ</em> used here can refer to the entire complex, including its courtyards, and not only to the inner sanctuary of the temple itself.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>hanged himself:</strong> Luke’s account of Judas’ death, recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:18-44:1:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ac 1:18</a>, reports that Judas fell and his body burst open. Matthew seems to deal with <em>how</em> he committed suicide, while Luke describes the <em>result.</em> Combining the two accounts, it appears that Judas hanged himself over a cliff, but at some point the rope or tree limb broke so that he plunged down and burst open on the rocks below. The topography around Jerusalem allows for such a conclusion.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:6-40:27:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>27:6</strong></a></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>sacred treasury:</strong> This term may refer to the portion of the temple called “the treasury” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:20-43:8:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joh 8:20</a>, apparently located in the area called the Court of the Women, where there were 13 treasury chests. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070231/">App. B11</a>.) It is believed that the temple also contained a major treasury where the money from the treasury chests was brought.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>price of blood:</strong> Or “blood money,” that is, money received for shedding blood.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:7-40:27:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>27:7</strong></a></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>they used the money:</strong> Matthew alone specifies that the chief priests used the 30 silver pieces to purchase a piece of property. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:18-44:1:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ac 1:18, 19</a> attributes the purchase to Judas, but this is evidently because the chief priests purchased the field with the money Judas provided.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s5"><strong>potter’s field:</strong> Since the fourth century C.E., this field has been identified with a location on the S slope of the Hinnom Valley, just before it joins the Kidron Valley. This seems to have been an area where potters pursued their craft. As shown at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:8-40:27:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mt 27:8</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:19-44:1:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ac 1:19</a>, the field came to be known as “Field of Blood,” or <em>Akeldama.</em>​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">App. B12</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>strangers:</strong> That is, Jews visiting from other lands or Gentiles.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s5"><strong>to this very day:</strong> This expression indicates a lapse of some time between the events considered and the time of writing. Matthew’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> was probably written about 41 C.E.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:</strong> The quotation following these words appears to be drawn principally from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Zec 11:12, 13</a> but is paraphrased by Matthew, who under inspiration applied it to the circumstances fulfilling it. In Matthew’s time, Jeremiah was placed first among the prophetic books, and his name may have applied to the whole collection of these books, including Zechariah.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/1:22$p/E:1001070601/44-44:267">study note on Mt 1:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s5"><strong>Jehovah:</strong> In this quote from the Hebrew Scriptures (see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/27:9$p/E:1001070627/24-24:436">study note on Mt 27:9</a>), the divine name, represented by four Hebrew consonants (transliterated <em>YHWH</em>), occurs in the original Hebrew text.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070241/">App. C</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:11-40:27:11" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>27:11</strong></a></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>Are you the King of the Jews?:</strong> No king in the Roman Empire could rule without Caesar’s consent. So Pilate apparently concentrated his interrogation on the issue of Jesus’ kingship.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s5"><strong>You yourself say it:</strong> This reply is evidently an affirmation of the truth of Pilate’s statement. (Compare <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:25$p/E:1001070626/44-44:591">study notes on Mt 26:25,</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/26:64$p/E:1001070626/93-93:375"> 64</a>.) Though Jesus confesses to Pilate that he really is a king, it is in a sense that differs from what Pilate imagines, since Jesus’ Kingdom is “no part of this world” and thus no threat to Rome.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:33-43:18:37" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Joh 18:33-37</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:15-40:27:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>27:15</strong></a></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s5"><strong>custom . . . to release a prisoner:</strong> This incident is mentioned by all four <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> writers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:6-41:15:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mr 15:6-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:16-42:23:25" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Lu 23:16-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:39-43:18:40" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Joh 18:39, 40</a>) There is no basis or precedent for this custom in the Hebrew Scriptures. However, it seems that by Jesus’ day, the Jews had developed this tradition. The practice would not have seemed strange to the Romans, since there is evidence that they released prisoners to please the crowds.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:19-40:27:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>27:19</strong></a></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>judgment seat:</strong> Usually a raised outdoor platform from which seated officials could address crowds and announce their judicial decisions.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s5"><strong>a dream:</strong> Evidently of divine origin. Matthew is the only <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> writer to include this incident in the inspired account.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:24-40:27:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>27:24</strong></a></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s5"><strong>washed his hands:</strong> A symbolic gesture used to claim innocence and freedom from responsibility in a matter. This Jewish custom is mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:6-5:21:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">De 21:6, 7</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:6-19:26:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps 26:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="s5"><strong>Let his blood come upon us and upon our children:</strong> That is, “We and our descendants take responsibility for his death.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:26-40:27:26" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>27:26</strong></a></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="s5"><strong>whipped:</strong> The Romans flogged victims using a terrible instrument known in <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a> as a <em>flagellum,</em> from which the Greek verb used here (<em>phra·gel·loʹo,</em> “to whip”) is derived. This instrument consisted of a handle into which several cords or knotted leather thongs were fixed. Sometimes the thongs were weighted with jagged pieces of bone or metal to make the blows more painful. Such floggings caused deep contusions, tore the flesh to ribbons, and could even lead to death.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:27-40:27:27" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong>27:27</strong></a></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="s5"><strong>governor’s residence:</strong> The Greek term <em>prai·toʹri·on</em> (derived from the <a class="xt" data-xtid="90" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077407/">Latin</a> <em>praetorium</em>) designates the official residence of the Roman governors. In Jerusalem, the residence was probably the palace built by Herod the Great, situated in the NW corner of the upper city, that is, of the southern part of Jerusalem. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">App. B12</a> for the location.) Pilate stayed in Jerusalem only on certain occasions, such as festivals, since there was a potential for unrest. His usual residence was in Caesarea.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:28-40:27:28" data-bid="31-1" class="b"><strong>27:28</strong></a></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="s5"><strong>scarlet cloak:</strong> The type of cloak or robe worn by kings, magistrates, or military officers. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:17-41:15:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mr 15:17</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:2-43:19:2" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Joh 19:2</a> say that it was a purple garment, but in ancient times, “purple” was used to describe any color that had a mixture of red and blue. Also, angle, light reflection, and background could have influenced the observer’s perception of the exact color. This variation in describing the color shows that the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> writers did not simply copy one another’s accounts.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:29-40:27:29" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><strong>27:29</strong></a></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>crown . . . reed:</strong> Along with the scarlet cloak (mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:28-40:27:28" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mt 27:28</a>), Jesus was given mock attributes of royalty​—thorns for a crown and a reed for a scepter.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="s5"><strong>kneeling before him:</strong> Kneeling, normally a gesture of respect toward a superior, was another way that the soldiers mocked Jesus.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/17:14$p/E:1001070617/15-15:122">study note on Mt 17:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="s5"><strong>Greetings:</strong> Or “Hail.” Lit., “Be rejoicing.” They hailed him as they would have hailed Caesar, evidently to ridicule the claim that he was a king.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:32-40:27:32" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong>27:32</strong></a></p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="s5"><strong>Cyrene:</strong> A city located near the North African coast, SSW of the island of Crete.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070234/">App. B13</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="s5"><strong>compelled into service:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/5:41$p/E:1001070605/92-92:385">study note on Mt 5:41</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="s5"><strong>torture stake:</strong> Or “execution stake.”​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="85" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077306/">Stake</a>”; “<a class="xt" data-xtid="65" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077328/">Torture stake</a>”; see also <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/10:38$p/E:1001070610/57-57:331">study notes on Mt 10:38</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/16:24$p/E:1001070616/50-50:297">16:24</a>, where the term is used in a figurative sense.</p>

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="s5"><strong><em>Golgotha:</em></strong> From a Hebrew word meaning “skull.” (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:17-43:19:17" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Joh 19:17</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:53-7:9:53" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Jg 9:53</a>, where the Hebrew word <em>gul·goʹleth</em> is rendered “skull.”) In Jesus’ day, the site was outside the city walls of Jerusalem. However, the location remains uncertain. (See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070232/">App. B12</a>.) The Bible record does not state that Golgotha was on a hill, though it does mention that some observed the execution from a distance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:40-41:15:40" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mr 15:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:49-42:23:49" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Lu 23:49</a>.</p>

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="s5"><strong>gall:</strong> The Greek word <em>kho·leʹ</em> here refers to a bitter liquid made from plants or a bitter substance in general. Matthew records that this event was a fulfillment of the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:21-19:69:21" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps 69:21</a>, where the <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> uses this Greek word to render the Hebrew word for “poison.” Apparently, women of Jerusalem had prepared the mixture of wine and gall to dull the pain of those being executed, and the Romans did not object to its use. The parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:23-41:15:23" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Mr 15:23</a> says that the wine was “drugged with myrrh,” so the drink evidently contained both myrrh and bitter gall.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="s5"><strong>he refused to drink it:</strong> Jesus evidently wanted to have full possession of all his faculties during this test of his faith.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:35-40:27:35" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><strong>27:35</strong></a></p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="s5"><strong>they distributed his outer garments:</strong> The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:23-43:19:24" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Joh 19:23, 24</a> adds complementary details not mentioned by Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Combining the four <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> accounts would give the following picture: Roman soldiers apparently cast lots over both the outer garment and the inner one; the soldiers divided the outer garments “into four parts, one for each soldier”; they did not want to divide the inner garment, so they cast lots over it; and the casting of lots for the Messiah’s apparel fulfilled <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:18-19:22:18" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 22:18</a>. It was evidently customary for the executioners to keep their victims’ clothes, so criminals were stripped of their clothing and possessions before being executed, making the ordeal all the more humiliating.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="s5"><strong>by casting lots:</strong> See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077174/">Lots</a>.”</p>

<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="s5"><strong>robbers:</strong> Or “bandits.” The Greek word <em>lei·stesʹ</em> may include robbing by using violence and at times could refer to revolutionaries. The same word is used of Barabbas (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:40-43:18:40" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Joh 18:40</a>), who according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:19-42:23:19" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Lu 23:19</a> was in prison for “sedition” and “murder.” The parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:32-42:23:33" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Lu 23:32, 33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:39-42:23:39" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 39</a> describes the men as “criminals” from a Greek word (<em>ka·kourʹgos</em>), which literally means “one who engages in doing bad or evil.”</p>

<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="s5"><strong><em>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?:</em></strong> Though some consider these words to be Aramaic, they were likely contemporary Hebrew, somewhat influenced by Aramaic.

This was a cheap drink that poor people, including Roman soldiers, commonly drank to quench their thirst.

<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="s5"><strong>to save him:</strong> Some ancient <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077377/">manuscripts</a> add: “Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out.” Other important manuscripts do not contain those words. A similar statement is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:34-43:19:34" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Joh 19:34</a>, but according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:33-43:19:33" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Joh 19:33</a>, Jesus was already dead when this occurred. Most authorities, including the editors of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="104" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077433/">Nestle-Aland</a> Greek text and the United Bible Societies Greek text, believe that the words of John’s account were later added to Matthew’s account by <a class="xt" data-xtid="35" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077362/">copyists</a>. Even <a class="xt" data-xtid="105" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077417/">Westcott</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="106" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077373/">Hort</a>, who included these words in their Greek text in double brackets, stated that the sentence “must lie under a strong presumption of having been introduced by scribes.” Considering that there are different manuscript readings for Matthew’s account and that there is no uncertainty regarding the reading in John’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>, the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:33-43:19:34" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Joh 19:33, 34</a> evidently presents the events in correct order, namely, that Jesus was already dead when the Roman soldier pierced him with the spear. Therefore, these words are omitted in this translation at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:49-40:27:49" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Mt 27:49</a>.</p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="s5"><strong>yielded up his spirit:</strong> Or “expired; ceased to breathe.” The term “spirit” (Greek, <em>pneuʹma</em>) may here be understood to refer to “breath” or “life force,” which is supported by the use of the Greek verb <em>ek·pneʹo</em> (lit., “to breathe out”) in the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:37-41:15:37" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Mr 15:37</a> (where it is rendered “expired” or, as in the study note, “breathed his last”). Some suggest that the use of the Greek term rendered “yielded up” means that Jesus voluntarily stopped struggling to stay alive, since all things had been accomplished. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:30-43:19:30" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Joh 19:30</a>) He willingly “poured out his life even to death.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:12-23:53:12" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Isa 53:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:11-43:10:11" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> Joh 10:11</a>.</p>
