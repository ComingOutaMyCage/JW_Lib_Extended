<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Onesimus arrives at the home of his master, Philemon, in Colossae, bringing him a letter from the apostle Paul, who is under house arrest in Rome. Sometime earlier, Onesimus had run away to Rome, where he became a Christian because of his contact with Paul. Learning of Onesimus’ situation, Paul encouraged him to return to Philemon. Onesimus may have wondered what treatment to expect because Philemon may have had the legal right to mete out severe punishment. In his letter to Philemon, Paul appeals to him to receive Onesimus kindly, not just as a slave but as a Christian brother. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:15-57:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phm 15-17</a>) Paul also expresses his confidence that Philemon will comply. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:21-57:1:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phm 21</a>) The letter harmonizes with the rest of the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, which contain many exhortations to all Christians to treat one another as brothers—regardless of wealth or social position.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ro 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:20-46:16:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1Co 16:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:15-51:4:15" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Col 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:9-52:4:10" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1Th 4:9, 10</a>.</p>
