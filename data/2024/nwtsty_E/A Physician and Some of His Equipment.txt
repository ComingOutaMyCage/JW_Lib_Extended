A Physician and Some of His Equipment




The artifacts shown in the photo (left) are just some of the medical equipment used by physicians in Roman times. Some physicians worked with high-quality tools like scalpels, scissors, and forceps. They also used medicines from plant matter, including antiseptic substances like wine and vinegar. (Compare Lu 10:34.) Medical practices were not regulated by the State. While some physicians were professionals​—skilled at treating diseases or performing surgery​—others fraudulently pretended to be doctors. A physician’s income and social standing may have been determined by his patients. Some doctors worked exclusively for a wealthy person or family. Others were doctors for a village, a city, or a military hospital. Some physicians worked at home, whereas others visited patients in their homes. “The beloved physician” Luke traveled with Paul during some of the apostle’s missionary journeys.​—Col 4:14.
