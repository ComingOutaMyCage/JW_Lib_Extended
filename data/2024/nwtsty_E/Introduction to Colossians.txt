Introduction to Colossians


Writer: Paul

Place Written: Rome

Writing Completed: c. 60-61 C.E.





Noteworthy Facts:

  Apparently, Paul had not visited Colossae. The congregation there was probably founded by Epaphras. (Col 1:7, 8; 2:1; 4:12) Paul, however, knew several Christians in Colossae. He names Archippus, Philemon, and Apphia. He also mentions the newly converted Onesimus, who was from Colossae.​—Col 4:9, 17; Phm 1, 2, 10.

  Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians apparently toward the end of his first imprisonment in Rome, or about 60-61 C.E. He dispatched the letter along with the one to Philemon. (Col 4:7-9; Phm 10-12) Paul directed that this letter to the Colossians be read in the nearby congregation of Laodicea and that the Colossians also read a letter that he had sent to the Laodiceans.​—Col 4:16.

  Paul emphasizes Christ’s central role in God’s arrangement. Christ is “the firstborn of all creation” and “the head of the body, the congregation.” “Through him . . . all other things” are reconciled to God, and through Christ’s sacrifice “the sacred secret . . . has been revealed.” (Col 1:13-22, 26-28; 2:2, 3) By increasing their knowledge of Christ’s role, the Christians in Colossae will be motivated to reject false teachings, deceptive philosophy, Jewish traditions, and worship of the angels.​—Col 2:8, 13-23.

  The letter to the Colossians is very much like Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. The two letters were composed about the same time, and it is possible that similar circumstances prevailed in each of those cities. Compare the following scriptures:
  Paul’s ministry in behalf of the people of the nations​—Eph 3:1-7; Col 1:24-29.

  The Mosaic Law taken out of the way by Christ’s death on the torture stake​—Eph 2:1-5, 13-16; Col 2:13, 14.

  The unity of the body, that is, the Christian congregation, under the head, the Christ​—Eph 4:16; Col 2:19.

  The old personality and the new​—Eph 4:20-25, 31, 32; Col 3:8-10, 12, 13.

  Encouragement to sing praises to God​—Eph 5:19; Col 3:16.

  Advice to Christian households​—Eph 5:21-23; 6:1-9; Col 3:18-25; 4:1.

  Paul sent Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister, both to Ephesus and to Colossae.​—Eph 6:21, 22; Col 4:7, 8.



  The letter to the Colossians is included with other letters of Paul in the papyrus codex known as P46, believed to date from about 200 C.E. This shows that the early Christians viewed the letter to the Colossians as one of Paul’s inspired writings. Early writers also confirm that Paul wrote the letter. Among them are Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Origen, and Tertullian.
