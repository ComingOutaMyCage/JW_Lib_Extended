This manuscript contains a large part of the Greek text of the Good News (or, <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>) According to John. The first page of this manuscript begins with the title (highlighted) <em>Eu·ag·geʹli·on Ka·taʹ I·o·anʹnen</em> (“Good News According to John”). Titles were evidently not part of the original text but were added later by <a class="xt" data-xtid="35" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077362/">copyists</a>. The use of such titles along with the name of the writer may have come about for practical reasons, providing a clear means of identification of the books.</p>
