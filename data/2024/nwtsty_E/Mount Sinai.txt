Mount Sinai




Mount Sinai, also known as Mount Horeb, is described in the Scriptures as “the mountain of the true God.” (Ex 3:1, 12; 24:13, 16; 1Ki 19:8; Ac 7:30, 38) At the foot of Mount Sinai, the Law covenant went into effect. (Ex 19:3-14; 24:3-8) For this reason, the apostle Paul referred to the Mosaic Law as the covenant “from Mount Sinai.” (Ga 4:24) Paul wrote that Mount Sinai is “a mountain in Arabia,” but its exact location is uncertain. (Ga 4:25) According to traditional views, it is part of a granite ridge (shown here in the center of the photo) that is situated on the Sinai Peninsula between the two northern arms of the Red Sea.
