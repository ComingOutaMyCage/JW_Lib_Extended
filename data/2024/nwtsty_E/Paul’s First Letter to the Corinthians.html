<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">Shown here is a page from a papyrus codex referred to as P<sup>46</sup>. Parts of it (Papyrus Chester Beatty 2) are housed in Dublin, Ireland, and parts of it (Papyrus Michigan Inv. 6238), in Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. This leaf is kept at the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin. The codex is believed to date from about the year 200 C.E. It consists of 86 somewhat damaged leaves from a codex that originally may have had 104 leaves. It contains nine of Paul’s inspired letters. Highlighted is the title, which reads “Toward [or, “To”] Corinthians 1.” This papyrus collection provides evidence that from an early date, scribes identified Bible books by titles.</p>
