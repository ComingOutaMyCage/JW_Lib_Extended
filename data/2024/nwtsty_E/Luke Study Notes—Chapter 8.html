<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>Mary who was called Magdalene:</strong> The woman often called Mary Magdalene is first mentioned here in the account of Jesus’ second year of preaching. Her distinguishing name, Magdalene (meaning “Of, or Belonging to, Magdala”), likely stems from the town of Magdala. This town was located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, about halfway between Capernaum and Tiberias. It has been suggested that Magdala was this Mary’s hometown or place of residence. Mary Magdalene is mentioned most prominently in connection with the death and resurrection of Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:55-40:27:56" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 27:55, 56,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:61-40:27:61" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 61;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:40-41:15:40" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Mr 15:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:10-42:24:10" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Lu 24:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:25-43:19:25" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Joh 19:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>Joanna:</strong> This is a shortened feminine form of the Hebrew name Jehohanan, meaning “Jehovah Has Shown Favor; Jehovah Has Been Gracious.” Joanna, one of the women who had been cured by Jesus, is mentioned only twice in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a> and only in Luke’s <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a> account.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:10-42:24:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lu 24:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>were ministering to them:</strong> Or “were supporting (providing for) them.” The Greek word <em>di·a·ko·neʹo</em> can refer to caring for the physical needs of others by obtaining, cooking, and serving food, and so forth. It is used in a similar sense at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:40-42:10:40" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lu 10:40</a> (“attend to things”), <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:37-42:12:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lu 12:37</a> (“minister”), <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:8-42:17:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lu 17:8</a> (“serve”), and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:2-44:6:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ac 6:2</a> (“distribute food”), but it can also refer to all other services of a similar personal nature. Here it describes how the women mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:2-42:8:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">verses 2 and 3</a> supported Jesus and his disciples, helping them to complete their God-given assignment.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="s5"><strong>My mother and my brothers:</strong> Jesus here makes a distinction between his natural brothers, some of whom apparently lacked faith in him (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:5-43:7:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Joh 7:5</a>), and his spiritual brothers, his disciples. He shows that regardless of how precious the ties are that bind him to his relatives, his relationship with those <strong>who hear the word of God and do it</strong> is even more precious.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s5"><strong>a violent windstorm:</strong> This expression renders two Greek words that could literally be translated “a hurricane of wind.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/4:37$p/E:1001070632/32-32:405">study note on Mr 4:37</a>.) Such storms are common on the Sea of Galilee. Its surface is about 210 m (690 ft) below sea level, and the air temperature is warmer on the sea than in the surrounding plateaus and mountains. Those conditions result in atmospheric disturbances and strong winds that can quickly whip up waves.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s5"><strong>region of the Gerasenes:</strong> A region <strong>on the side opposite,</strong> that is, the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The exact limits of this region are unknown today, and its identification is uncertain. Some link “the region of the Gerasenes” with the area around Kursi, near the steep slopes on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. Others think that it was the large district radiating from the city of Gerasa (Jarash), which was 55 km (34 mi) SSE of the Sea of Galilee. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:28-40:8:28" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mt 8:28</a> calls it “the region of the Gadarenes.” (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/8:28$p/E:1001070608/45-45:454">study notes on Mt 8:28;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070145/5:1$p/E:1001070633/4-4:477"> Mr 5:1</a>.) Although different names are used, they refer to the general area of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, and the regions may have been overlapping. Thus, there is no contradiction between the accounts.​—See also <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070210/">App. A7</a>, Map 3B, “Activity at the Sea of Galilee,” and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1001070230/">App. B10</a>.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s5"><strong>a demon-possessed man:</strong> Matthew (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:28-40:8:28" data-bid="26-1" class="b">8:28</a>) mentions two men, but Mark (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:2-41:5:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">5:2</a>) and Luke refer to one. Mark and Luke evidently drew attention to just one demon-possessed man because Jesus spoke to him and because his case was more outstanding. Possibly, that man was more violent or had suffered under demon control for a longer time. It could also be that after the two men were healed, only one of them wanted to accompany Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:37-42:8:39" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Lu 8:37-39</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s5"><strong>torment me:</strong> A related Greek term is used of “the jailers” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:34-40:18:34" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mt 18:34</a>. So in this context, the “torment” would seem to refer to a restraining or a confining to “the abyss” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:31-42:8:31" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Lu 8:31</a>.​—See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/18:34$p/E:1001070618/43-43:348">study note on Mt 18:34</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="s5"><strong>the abyss:</strong> Or “the deep.” The Greek word <em>aʹbys·sos,</em> meaning “exceedingly deep” or “unfathomable; boundless,” refers to a place or condition of confinement or imprisonment. It occurs nine times in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>​—here, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:7-45:10:7" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ro 10:7</a>, and seven times in the book of Revelation. The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Re 20:1-3</a> describes the future casting of Satan into the abyss for a thousand years. The legion of demons who entreated Jesus not to send them “into the abyss” may have had that future event in mind. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:28-42:8:28" data-bid="36-1" class="b">verse 28</a>, one of the demons asked Jesus not to “torment” him. In the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:29-40:8:29" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Mt 8:29</a>, the demons asked Jesus: “Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?” So the “torment” the demons feared would seem to refer to their being confined or imprisoned in “the abyss.”​—See <a class="xt" data-xtid="125" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077007/">Glossary</a> and <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070144/8:29$p/E:1001070608/50-50:216">study note on Mt 8:29</a>.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="s5"><strong>swine:</strong> Pigs were unclean according to the Law (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:7-3:11:7" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Le 11:7</a>), but there was a market for pork among the many non-Jews living in the Decapolis region. Both Greeks and Romans considered pork a delicacy. The account does not state whether “the herders” were Jews who were violating the Law.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:34-42:8:34" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Lu 8:34</a>.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="s5"><strong>keep on relating what God did for you:</strong> In contrast with Jesus’ usual instructions not to publicize his miracles (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:44-41:1:44" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Mr 1:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:12-41:3:12" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:36-41:7:36" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 7:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:14-42:5:14" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> Lu 5:14</a>), he instructed this man to tell his relatives what had happened. This may have been because Jesus was asked to leave the region and would not personally give them a witness. The man’s testimony would also serve to counteract unfavorable reports that might circulate over the loss of the swine.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="s5"><strong>the whole city:</strong> The parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:20-41:5:20" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Mr 5:20</a> says “in the Decapolis.” So the city mentioned here apparently refers to one of the cities in the Decapolis region.​—See Glossary, “<a class="xt" data-xtid="47" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077079/">Decapolis</a>.”</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="s5"><strong>only:</strong> The Greek word <em>mo·no·ge·nesʹ,</em> traditionally rendered “only-begotten,” has been defined as “the only one of its kind; one and only; the only one or member of a class or kind; unique.” The term is used in describing the relation of both sons and daughters to their parents. In this context, it is used in the sense of an only child. The same Greek word is also used of the “only” son of a widow in Nain and of a man’s “only” son whom Jesus cured of a demon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:12-42:7:12" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Lu 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:38-42:9:38" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 9:38</a>) The Greek <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> uses <em>mo·no·ge·nesʹ</em> when speaking of Jephthah’s daughter, concerning whom it is written: “Now she was his one and only child. Besides her, he had neither son nor daughter.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:34-7:11:34" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Jg 11:34</a>) In the apostle John’s writings, <em>mo·no·ge·nesʹ</em> is used five times with reference to Jesus.​—For the meaning of the term when used about Jesus, see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/1:14$p/E:1001070669/31-31:1168">study notes on Joh 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070147/3:16$p/E:1001070671/23-23:1000"> 3:16</a>.</p>
