<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="s5"><strong>I am sending the brothers:</strong> See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/16:3$p/E:1001070749/8-8:923">study note on 1Co 16:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s5"><strong>not as something extorted:</strong> The Greek word here rendered “something extorted” is usually translated “greed” or “greediness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:15-42:12:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 12:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:29-45:1:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ro 1:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:19-49:4:19" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Eph 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 5:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Col 3:5</a>) Therefore, the Greek expression indicates that Paul and his coworkers did not take up a collection with the wrong motive, in a spirit of greed. Paul did not pressure the Christians in Corinth into contributing to the relief work. He gave them no reason to feel as if someone had exploited them or extorted the funds from them. The giving was to be voluntary, out of a generous and cheerful heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Co 9:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:6-47:9:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>9:6</strong></a></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s5"><strong>whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully:</strong> The expression “bountifully” describes sowing an abundance of material blessings or benefits. Paul encourages the Christians in Corinth to sow bountifully, that is, to show generosity in connection with the relief ministry for the brothers in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:26-45:15:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ro 15:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:4-47:8:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2Co 8:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:1-47:9:1" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 9:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 7</a>) Those brothers had apparently suffered many hardships, perhaps losing many of their possessions as a result of persecution from the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:14-52:2:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Th 2:14</a>) Paul indicates that the Corinthian Christians would also “reap bountifully,” receiving such blessings as God’s undeserved kindness and favor, as well as the assurance that they too would be cared for in a material way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:8-47:9:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2Co 9:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:10-47:9:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10</a>) All the brothers would give glory to God and thank him, either for the privilege of giving or for the assistance that they received.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:11-47:9:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Co 9:11-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>9:7</strong></a></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="s5"><strong>has resolved in his heart:</strong> In discussing the relief effort to help the needy Christians in Judea, Paul was confident that the Christians in Corinth desired to contribute to the effort. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:4-47:8:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2Co 8:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:6-47:8:6" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:10-47:8:10" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:1-47:9:2" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 9:1, 2</a>) Now the Corinthians needed to turn their willingness and zeal into action. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:3-47:9:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Co 9:3-5</a>) Paul did not want to pressure them, for a person can hardly be “a cheerful giver” when he or she is coerced. Paul trusted that they had <em>already resolved</em> to give. The Greek word rendered “resolved” in this verse means “to decide beforehand; to determine ahead of time.” So Paul points out that a genuine Christian gives after he has considered ahead of time the needs of fellow believers and how he can contribute toward filling those needs.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s5"><strong>grudgingly:</strong> Or “reluctantly.” The Greek expression rendered “grudgingly” literally means “out of sadness (grief).”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s5"><strong>under compulsion:</strong> The Greek expression for “under compulsion” means “from necessity” or “under pressure.” Giving cannot result in real happiness to the giver if it is forced, causing one to feel pressured to give. Thus, Paul indicates that in the early Christian congregation, making contributions was to be completely voluntary.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:10-5:15:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">De 15:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="s5"><strong>for God loves a cheerful giver:</strong> God is very pleased with a Christian who gives with the right motive to support true worship or to assist fellow believers. “A cheerful giver” is truly happy <em>because</em> he or she is able to give. Throughout history, God’s people have received joy from giving of themselves and their resources to support Jehovah’s worship. For example, the Israelites of Moses’ day joyfully supported the construction of the tabernacle. Those “with a willing heart” cheerfully gave gold, silver, wood, linen, and other things as a voluntary “contribution for Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:4-2:35:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex 35:4-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:4-2:36:7" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 36:4-7</a>) Centuries later, King David, along with princes, chiefs, and others, contributed generously toward the temple of Jehovah to be built by David’s son Solomon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:3-13:29:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1Ch 29:3-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:9-47:9:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>9:9</strong></a></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s5"><strong>has distributed widely:</strong> In his discussion of giving aid to needy fellow believers, Paul quotes the Greek <a class="xt" data-xtid="29" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077384/"><em>Septuagint</em></a> translation of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:112:9-19:112:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps 112:9</a> (111:9, <em>LXX</em>), where the Greek word here rendered “distributed widely” is used to render the corresponding Hebrew term. Both the Greek and the Hebrew terms literally mean “to scatter.” In this context, the expression conveys the figurative idea of generous or abundant giving or distributing. Thus, it could also be translated “has distributed generously.” The truly generous person does not fear that his freehearted giving, even if it sometimes exceeds his actual financial means, will bring him to poverty.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:8-47:9:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2Co 9:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:10-47:9:10" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s5"><strong>His righteousness:</strong> Paul continues to quote from the Hebrew Scriptures. (See study note on <strong>has distributed widely</strong> in this verse.) The one who does kind and beneficial deeds, such as giving generously to the poor, shows that he has the quality of “righteousness.” A person who conducts himself in harmony with God’s will and righteous standards rather than his own has the hope of doing so forever.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:1-40:6:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mt 6:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 33</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:12-47:9:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>9:12</strong></a></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s5"><strong>public service:</strong> Paul applies this term to <strong>the ministry,</strong> or the relief work, that was carried out “to provide well for the needs of” the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem and Judea. Such work, or service, was truly of great benefit to fellow worshippers. The Greek word <em>lei·tour·giʹa,</em> used here, and the related words <em>lei·tour·geʹo</em> (to render public service) and <em>lei·tour·gosʹ</em> (public servant, or worker) were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to refer to work or service for the State or for civil authorities and done for the benefit of the people. In the <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077365/">Christian Greek Scriptures</a>, these terms are frequently used in connection with the temple service and the Christian ministry. For this usage, see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070146/1:23$p/E:1001070645/43-43:985">study notes on Lu 1:23;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/13:2$p/E:1001070702/6-6:1705"> Ac 13:2;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/13:6$p/E:1001070730/18-18:797"> Ro 13:6;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/15:16$p/E:1001070732/17-17:903"> 15:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="se"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:13-47:9:13" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>9:13</strong></a></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s5"><strong>relief ministry:</strong> This is translated from the Greek term usually rendered “ministry,” which shows that relief efforts in behalf of needy believers are a vital aspect of the Christian ministry, part of “sacred service.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ro 12:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:7-45:12:7" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7</a>; see <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/11:29$p/E:1001070700/15-15:893">study notes on Ac 11:29;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070149/15:31$p/E:1001070732/35-35:604"> Ro 15:31;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070151/8:4$p/E:1001070757/6-6:690"> 2Co 8:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s5"><strong>contribution:</strong> The Greek word <em>koi·no·niʹa</em> conveys the basic idea of sharing, and the meaning varies according to context. (See <a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070148/2:42$p/E:1001070691/62-62:334">study notes on Ac 2:42;</a><a href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/1:9$p/E:1001070734/12-12:253"> 1Co 1:9</a>.) Here it conveys the idea of giving that is motivated by a feeling of fellowship. The same word is similarly used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb 13:16</a>: “Do not forget to do good and <em>to share what you have with others,</em> for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”</p>
