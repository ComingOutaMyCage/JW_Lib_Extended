1 THESSALONIANS
Study Notes​—Chapter 3

3:1
we: Paul may have been alone in Athens, later departing for Corinth, where Silas and Timothy rejoined him. (Ac 18:5) So he may have used “we” as applying to himself. While it cannot be ruled out that either Silas or Timothy was with Paul in Athens, it does not seem likely, since he had left them behind in Beroea.​—Ac 17:13, 14.
3:2
minister: Some ancient manuscripts read “fellow worker,” using the same Greek word (sy·ner·gosʹ) that appears at 1Co 3:9 (see study note), where Paul speaks of Christians as “God’s fellow workers.”
3:3
we cannot avoid suffering such things: Or “we are appointed to this.” This does not mean that Christians were individually appointed to suffer certain trials. Rather, Jehovah and his Son knew that the Christian congregation as a whole would suffer persecution as a result of the witnessing work. (Mt 10:17, 21-23; 23:34; Joh 16:33) However, persecution often served to help, not hinder, their preaching. For example, when Christians had to flee Jerusalem because of severe persecution, they spread the message in the lands to which they were scattered.​—Ac 8:1-5; 11:19-21.
3:5
faithfulness: The Greek word used here (piʹstis) can be rendered by such terms as “faith” (Mt 8:10; Ro 1:17; 1Th 3:2, 10), “faithfulness” (Mt 23:23), and “trustworthiness” (Tit 2:10). In this context (1Th 3:5-7), piʹstis indicates that the Thessalonian Christians were remaining firm and sticking to their faith despite adversity. It thus highlights their “faithfulness,” or loyalty, to God when they were under trial. Their example of faithfulness encouraged Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, who were experiencing “distress and tribulation.”​—1Th 3:7.
the Tempter: This designation for Satan the Devil, used twice in the Christian Greek Scriptures, is a form of the Greek verb “to tempt; to test.” (Mt 4:3) Other forms of the same verb are used to describe the activities of Satan, for example, at 1Co 7:5 and Re 2:10.
3:7
distress: Lit., “necessity.” The term used here is also rendered “times of need.” (2Co 6:4; 12:10) So Paul may be referring to situations in which he and his companions were lacking the basic necessities of life.
3:8
we are revitalized: Lit., “we live.” The Greek word meaning “to live” is here used figuratively in the sense of feeling a renewed life, of being joyful, refreshed, and freed from anxiety.
3:10
make supplications: See study note on Ac 4:31.
3:13
at the presence of our Lord Jesus: See study note on 1Th 2:19.
