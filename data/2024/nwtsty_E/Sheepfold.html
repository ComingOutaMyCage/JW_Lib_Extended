Shepherds kept their flocks in the safety of a sheepfold during the night. In Bible times, sheepfolds were roofless structures of different shapes and sizes, often with stone walls and only one opening. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:16-4:32:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 32:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:3-9:24:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1Sa 24:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:6-36:2:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Zep 2:6</a>) John speaks of entering a sheepfold “through the door,” which was guarded by a “doorkeeper.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:1-43:10:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joh 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:3-43:10:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3</a>) In a community sheepfold, more than one flock might spend the night, and the doorkeeper would keep watch to protect the sheep. In the morning, the doorkeeper would open the door for the shepherds. Each shepherd would collect his flock by calling out to the sheep, and his sheep would recognize the voice of their shepherd and respond. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:3-43:10:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joh 10:3-5</a>) Jesus referred to this practice to illustrate the way he cared for his disciples.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:7-43:10:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joh 10:7-14</a>.</p>
