<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p2" data-pid="2">The first letter to the Thessalonians is the earliest of Paul’s inspired writings. Paul visited Thessalonica about 50 C.E. during his second missionary tour. The congregation that was formed there soon had to contend with opposition, which forced Paul and Silas to leave the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:1-44:17:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ac 17:1-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:13-44:17:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Describing his stay in Thessalonica, Paul said that he and his companions worked “night and day” so that they would not put “an expensive burden” on the brothers in Thessalonica. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:5-52:2:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Th 2:5-9</a>) Since Paul was a tentmaker, he may have worked at this trade to support himself in the ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:2-44:18:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 18:2, 3</a>) No doubt, as Paul worked, he also preached to all those whom he met.</p>
