Garments Worn by a Pharisee in Jesus’ Day




The Pharisees took the statements found at De 6:6-8 and 11:18 literally. Motivated by self-righteousness and superstition, they strapped a scripture-containing case to their left arm and, at times, bound one to their forehead. In addition, the Pharisees not only wore fringes on their garments, as directed in the Law, but also lengthened the fringes so that they were more conspicuous.—Nu 15:38; Mt 23:5.
