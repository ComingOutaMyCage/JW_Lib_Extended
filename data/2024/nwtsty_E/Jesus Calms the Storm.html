The men are terrified that they will drown, and they cry for help. Jesus, who is sleeping, wakes up and commands the sea: “Hush! Be quiet!” Immediately, the storm abated, and “a great calm set in.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:35-41:4:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mr 4:35-41</a>) This miracle indicates that when Jesus rules the earth, he and his Father will never allow severe weather to harm subjects of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Re 21:4</a>) Mark is not present on this occasion, but he still records the event in the action-packed and fast-moving style of writing that is characteristic of his <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077366/">Gospel</a>. The vivid description and the details mentioned in this account may indicate that he obtained the information from someone who was onboard, possibly Peter.</p>
