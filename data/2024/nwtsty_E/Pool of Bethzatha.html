That gate was located in the NE corner of the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:1-16:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ne 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:32-16:3:32" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:39-16:12:39" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 12:39</a>) Or “the Sheep Gate” mentioned by John may have been built at a later date than the one mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. North of the temple mount, archaeologists have discovered the remains of a large pool that seems to match the description given by John. Excavations reveal a pool consisting of two basins and embracing an overall area of about 46 by 92 m (150 by 300 ft). The Gospel account says that the pool had “five colonnades” and could accommodate “a multitude” of sick and disabled people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:2-43:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joh 5:2, 3</a>) The wall separating the northern and southern basins likely included one of these five colonnades, and the other four likely lined the outer perimeter of the pool area.</p>
