Metal Mirror




The photo (left) shows a bronze mirror that dates to the third or second century B.C.E., and the illustration (right) shows what such a mirror may have looked like in the first century C.E. Craftsmen in Corinth produced bronze products, including mirrors that were famous for their high quality. However, ancient metal mirrors did not have as fine a reflecting surface as glass mirrors today. In his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul contrasts looking into a metal mirror with seeing face-to-face.​—1Co 13:12.
