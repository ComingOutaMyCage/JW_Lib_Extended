Your voluntary contributions help to cover these expenses and also support the worldwide work. For your convenience, clearly marked contribution boxes are located throughout the facility. If possible, however, please donate online by visiting <a href="https://donate.jw.org/">donate.jw.org</a>. All donations are very much appreciated.
