<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">VOL. XIV.     APRIL 15, 1893.     NO. 8.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE WORD WAS A GOD.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God, and the Logos was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God.  The same was in the beginning with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God.  All things were made by him [the Logos], and without him was not anything made that was made.&quot;--`John 1:1-3`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Apostle gives us in these words a brief statement of our great Redeemer's pre-human history.  We adopt the word Logos as one of our Lord's many names.  Dr. Adam Clarke also advocates its use in this manner, saying, &quot;This term </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[Logos]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should be left untranslated, for the very same reasons why the names </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are left untranslated.  As every appellative of the Savior of the world was descriptive of some excellence in his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">person, nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or work, so the epithet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Logos,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which signifies a word spoken, speech, eloquence, doctrine, reason, or the faculty of reasoning, is very properly applied to him.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another difference, between the above translation and the common version, is the addition of the italicized words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  These are supplied in order to give the reader the true sense of the Greek text, in which the presence or absence of the Greek article is very important. In the above translation </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> represents the article, while </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shows that the article is lacking.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With this translation verified and appreciated (as can be done by consulting any Greek Testament or any Greek scholar), these verses, long doubtful and obscure to so many, become luminous.  In them John tells the same story that our Lord tells us over and over again (See `Rev. 1:8,11,17`; `2:8`; `3:14`; `21:6`; `22:13`), that he is the beginning and the ending, the first and the last, of the creation of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle Paul adds his testimony in the same line, saying, He &quot;is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation: for by him were all things created....All things were created by him and for him.&quot; (`Col. 1:15`.) The Heavenly Father had no beginning, but is from everlasting to everlasting the same. Our Lord's great honor is shown in that he was not only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God's creation but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">last.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  From this we are to understand that the great Jehovah did not directly employ his own power in creating either men or angels; but that he delegated his power to his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Only</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-begotten Son--using him as his honored agent and representative in every case--in every respect giving him the pre-eminence over all others; second only to himself.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE ALMIGHTY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   But although our Redeemer had always occupied the place of honor in the heavenly courts, it was not until his faithful obedience to the Father had been tested to the extent of his changing nature to that of man, and then giving himself as fallen man's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he received his present unexcellable glory and</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1515 : page 115::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">honor.  It is since his resurrection that the message has gone forth--&quot;All power in heaven and in earth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is given</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto me.&quot; (`Matt. 28:18`.) Consequently it is only since then that he could be called the Almighty (as in `Rev. 1:8`).  The Heavenly Father has always been almighty, and</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1515 : page 116::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all-power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all-might</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was never </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">given</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to him, but was his eternal possession.  But now that he has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">given</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the same power to his Only-begotten and well-pleasing Son, our Saviour, both we and angels delight to know it, and delight to honor him whom the Father has so highly honored, and whom he has instructed us to honor, saying: &quot;That all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.&quot;-- `John 5:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The reasons leading up to our Lord's present great exaltation are clearly stated by the Apostle, as examined below.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ROBBERY TO BE EQUAL TO GOD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Apostle's words in `Philippians 2:6` have (by a bad translation, at the hands of those whose judgments were warped by an erroneous view) been turned about and made to say the very reverse of what he intended.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle is showing Christ's faithfulness or loyalty and obedience to the Father.  Not satisfied with referring to his earthly course, he goes back of it to the time when our Lord was a spirit being, before he humbled himself by his translation or change of nature to a lower one, --from spiritual to human nature.  The Apostle seems to have had Satan's course in his mind,--contrasting his wrong course and its end with Christ's proper course and its glorious results.  Satan did not hesitate to rob God of his glory, saying, &quot;I will ascend above the stars [above the other bright ones of the angelic host--I will be a leader, a chief], I will be like the Most High&quot; [I will pose as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">another</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Potentate a rival and peer of Jehovah]. (`Isa. 14:14`.) But, says the Apostle, Christ, when a spirit being in God's form, thought not of robbery to be God's equal, &quot;but [on the contrary, in obedience to the Father's plan] stripped himself [of the glory and dignity already enjoyed], taking a bond-servants form, being made in the likeness of men.  And [afterward], being in the likeness of men [&quot;Made flesh&quot;--`Jno. 1:14`], he [still further, and in harmony with the same obedient spirit] humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, [and, yet more humiliating] even the death of the cross.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [because he did not attempt to usurp, but on the contrary was humble] God hath supremely exalted him, and given to him a name [honor, title, dignity] above every [other] name.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What a wonderful contrast!  Satan, who attempted to rob God of his honor and station, is cast out, and will ultimately be destroyed. Christ, who humbled himself in every sense of the word, has been exalted to the very position which Satan coveted.  And the Apostle recounts this matter in order to enforce upon all followers of Christ that, like their Master, they should be humble and unassuming--humbling themselves that they, too, may be exalted in due time.--See the context: `verses 3-5`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE GODHEAD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Godhead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occurs three times in the Scriptures--`Acts 17:29`; `Rom. 1:20`; `Col. 2:9`. It is a meaningless word, and merely a bad translation.  It should be rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Divinity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deity,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and then would be intelligible.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">MIGHTY GOD, EVERLASTING FATHER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   These are among the great titles of our glorified Lord, predicted through `Isaiah--9:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In our issue of June, 1892, in which this subject was much more thoroughly examined, we showed the meaning of the word &quot;God&quot; to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mighty one.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We gave instances in which this same word (in Hebrew, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">El</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Elohim</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">) is used when referring to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">great</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men and angels.  Our Lord would be reverenced and titled Very Mighty or Very Great.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The signification of the title, &quot;Everlasting Father&quot; or Father Forever, is seen when we remember that the special meaning of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">father</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life-giver.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Jehovah is the Life-giver of all creatures in the sense that he is the fountain from which all life originally proceeded.  But after man had forfeited his God-given privilege, by disobedience, he needed a new life. And Jehovah sent forth his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Only</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-begotten Son, to become man's Life-giver, by redeeming man's life with his own and then giving the new life to whoever will accept it under the terms of the New Covenant, which he mediated.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Since all of our race have thus been redeemed, and restitution to human perfection is thus provided for all, through this Life-giver,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1515 : page 117::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">he will be known to the redeemed world as their Father Forever, the one through whom their redeemed, restitution life was obtained. The propriety of this is evident when it is remembered that the restitution life which our Lord will give the world was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">purchased</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by him with his own precious [life] blood.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;little flock&quot; now being selected as &quot;members of his body,&quot; his &quot;bride,&quot; would also have been of this class of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">children of Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were it not for their high-calling to become his &quot;brethren,&quot; &quot;body&quot; or &quot;bride,&quot; and to experience the change of nature which this calling implies and necessitates.  To fit these for their &quot;high-calling,&quot; they are begotten </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (from the restitution-life hopes obtained through faith in Christ), to the divine nature. (`2 Pet. 1:4`.)  This divine nature was not purchased by our Lord Jesus; hence he is not the father or giver of it.  Jehovah alone gives it: hence the Apostle declares, &quot;The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath begotten us,&quot; and Christ is &quot;not ashamed to call them Brethren.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE RACE IN ADAM.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Ye shall not surely die.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Satan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Gen. 3:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   God's blessing upon his prime agents, in his purpose of peopling the earth--&quot;Be fruitful and multiply&quot;--embraces in it the full power and authority of the agents to bring forth the race entrusted to them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's purpose did not contemplate a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> race, but he had made bountiful provisions for the happiness of a race of perfect beings, reflecting moral and intellectual qualities the exact counterparts of his own; and while he well knew and had arranged for all possible contingencies, he did not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">design</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them.  He could not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">design</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or &quot;do evil that good might come.&quot; In his purpose the race was already </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and hence </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the agents prepared and empowered through his blessing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This recognition of things that are not (yet) is lawful and right in view of the certainty of the agents employed and the steadfastness of purpose in him who &quot;worketh all things after the counsel of his will&quot; and according to his own purposes.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Contending for change of forms of Scriptural expressions upon the grounds of grammatical construction cannot affect the recorded condition and facts of experience.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To say that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;By</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Adam all die&quot; does not change the relationship nor responsibility of Adam--Levi is said to have paid tithes to Melchisedec while yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the loins of his father. (`Heb. 7:10`.)  The case is not altered whether we say the tithes were paid </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Abraham or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Abraham.  Adam, then, did not represent a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> race, neither was he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">on trial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> race, but he certainly did stand for and represent a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">living</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> race--God's purposes were centered here: outside of Adam God had made no</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1516 : page 118::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">provision, unless as contingencies should arise to make them necessary for the completion of his benevolent plans.  In Adam were wrapped the destinies of the race; from him it should inherit life, and that life was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in him,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so that, instead of not living </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him, mankind had no other source of existence; and when the hour of Adam's testing came, the crisis of the race had come, and the fatal sequence is that he entailed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon mankind instead of any right to life.  Thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Adam all die, while yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him, for none had yet been born when he fell under condemnation.  The sentence was pronounced, and its justice is open to the investigation of all intelligences; and the very throne of Jehovah depends upon its being found &quot;True and righteous altogether.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus we see that the race never had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> its inheritance was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for a condemned thing is already </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and can only resolve to &quot;dust as it was.&quot;  Evolution upwards, or out of death, is wholly impossible; for there is nothing left. The &quot;dying now&quot; is not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;a double infliction</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the penalty,&quot; but a carrying out of the sentence--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no hope but in a Ransom--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a man's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life for a man's life.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  That only can remove the legal hindrance and permit the call, &quot;Return, ye children of men,&quot; without impugning the exact justice of the penalty.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus we see that Satan can devise no scheme offering hope for man except it be upon his prolific lie.  And so we find this according to the latest deduction (erroneously drawn from Scripture statements of God's designs and foreknowledge) to be as follows: &quot;Hence death as a result of sin could not have been, either in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fact or design,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> more than </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">temporary.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The wages of sin is death--looking forward to deliverance --eternal life!&quot;  In other words, &quot;Ye shall not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">surely</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> die.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Good men of all ages have conceived of deliverance upon reasonable hopes within their experience and conceptions of God, having no grounds for a formulated theory save the one that makes God a liar; but how much severer ought our judgment to be, if we, after seeing God in the amazing revelations of himself, should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wilfully</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reject the only basis and means of the designed and soon to be accomplished deliverance, and insist upon the same errors?</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1516 : page 118::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SELF-EXAMINATION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In `2 Cor. 13:5`, Paul says, &quot;Try your own selves whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.  Or know ye not, your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?&quot; The context apparently shows that the Corinthians had accused Paul of having no influence over them for good, and his ministry as being weak and insignificant.  Paul replies by telling them to look at their present condition as compared with their past, see the change that has taken place in their lives, see the possession they now have, and in the light of these things let them say whether his influence over them has been for good or not, or if his ministry is weak and insignificant.  Again, in `1 Cor. 11:28`, the same Apostle says, &quot;Let a man examine himself.&quot;  But in this Paul means only to interpose a caution to prepare the receiver to eat the Lord's supper worthily.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is impossible to know ourselves by looking at the present.  We only partly know ourselves as we see our life in the past.  Every day our actions surprise us, and frequently we find that we have done the very thing we never thought we would do.  I suppose Abraham did not really know the strength of his faith till called upon to sacrifice Isaac.  In the light of that trial he could estimate the real strength of his faith.  In the shortness of memory we fail to profit by past mistakes.  In every action of ours there are so many details giving rise to so many causes of actions which may differ in each action, thus making it impossible for us to judge truly of our own condition.  The Greeks had a favorite motto among their philosophers, &quot;Know thyself;&quot; but by this they did not mean to teach that by merely looking into their own actions they came to understand their own character and became able to estimate their real worth, but</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1516 : page 119::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">rather that each one should examine the basis and facts of his philosophy for himself, and not be content to receive them second-hand. Then, again, many people do not grow better from rigid self-introspection.  The bad only see good and excuses for the evil in their lives. The good only see evil in theirs, and sadden their lives by deploring it.  One of the saintliest women I ever knew, and whom all reverenced, began to direct her attention to her own life, to examine it, to search it, and to question whether she did truly believe or not, till in a few months she concluded she had no faith, that her life was full of evil deeds, that she was unsaved and had no hope, and that there was none for her; and in this state she lives to-day.</font><br />

The Christian only grows Godlike, strong in faith and hope, as he learns to look away from himself to the Son of Man.  It is said that one of the gifted painters of the world stood before the masterpiece of the greatest genius of the age.  This he never hoped to rival, nor even to equal, yet the infinite superiority did not crush him, nor cause him to despair.  He saw realized those conceptions that had long floated vaguely before him in unsubstantial form; in every line and touch he felt a spirit immeasurably superior.  As he stood gazing at it his heart swelled with emotion, his feelings became elevated, and he turned away exclaiming, &quot;And I, too, am a painter.&quot;  Let the hesitating believer look on Christ, the embodiment of the highest and holiest of all conceptions, till his heart can feel his spirit and touch, then he can turn to the world, believing and declaring, &quot;I, too, am a Christian.&quot;             --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sel.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ROMANIST DESIGNS ON AMERICAN CITIES.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">BY C. CHINIQUY, A FORMER ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   When, in 1852, it became evident that my plan of forming a colony of French Canadians on the fertile plains of Illinois was to be a success, D'Arcy McGee, then editor of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Freeman's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Journal,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the official paper of the Bishop of New York, wrote me to know my views, and he determined immediately to put himself at the head of a similar enterprise in favor of the Irish Roman Catholics.  He published long and able articles to show how the Irish people, with few exceptions, were demoralized and kept down in the cities, and how they would soon be raised to the top if they could be induced to exchange city grog-shops and saloons for the rich lands of the West.  Through his influence a large assembly, principally composed of Irish priests, to which I was invited, met at Buffalo in the Spring of 1853.  But what was</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1517 : page 120::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">his disappointment when he saw that the greater part of these priests were sent by the bishops of New York, Albany, Boston, etc., to oppose and defeat his plans!  He vainly spoke with the most burning eloquence for the support of his pet scheme.  The majority of the priests coldly answered him in the name of their bishops: &quot;We are determined, like you, to take possession of the United States and rule them; but we cannot do that except by acting secretly, and by using the utmost wisdom.  If our plans were known they would certainly be defeated. What does a skilful general do when he wants to conquer a country?  Does he scatter his soldiers over the farm lands and spend their time and energies in plowing the fields and sowing the grain?  No.  He keeps them well united around his banners, and marches at their head to the conquest of the strongholds.  He subdues the large cities one after the other; he pulls down the high towers and the citadels which he meets on his way.  Then the farming countries are conquered and become the price of his victory without moving a finger.  So it is with us.  Silently and patiently we must mass our Irish Roman Catholics in the great cities of the United States.  Let us remember that in this country the vote of one of our poorest journeymen, covered with rags, has as much weight in the scale of power as the vote of the millionaire Astor, and that if we have two votes against the millionaire's one, he becomes as powerless as an oyster.  Then let us multiply our voters, let us call on poor but faithful Irish Catholics, and gather them from the far corners of the world into the very hearts of those proud citadels which the Yankees are so proudly building up under the name of New York, Boston, Chicago, Albany, Buffalo, Troy, etc.  Under the shadows of those great cities the Americans consider themselves as a giant and an unconquerable race.  They look upon the Irish Catholic with the utmost contempt, as only fit to dig their canals, sweep their streets, or humbly cook their meals in their kitchen.  Let no one awake these sleeping lions to-day; let us pray God that they may sleep and dream their sweet dreams a few years more.  How sad will be their awakening when, with our outnumbering votes, we will turn them out, and forever, from every position of power, honor and profit! What will these hypocrite sons and daughters of the fanatical Pilgrim Fathers say when not a single judge, not a single school-teacher, not even a single policeman will be elected if he be not a devoted Irish Catholic?  What will those so-called giants think and say of their unsurpassed ability, skill and shrewdness when not a single governor, senator, or member of congress will be elected if he be not sincerely devoted to our Holy Father, the Pope?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;What a sad figure those Protestant Yankees will cut when we will not only elect the President, but fill and command the armies, man the navy, and have the key of the public treasury in our hands!  It will then be the time for our devoted Irish Catholics to give up their grog-shops to become the governors and judges of the land.  Then our poor and humble Irish mechanics will come out from the damp ditches and the canals to rule the cities in all their departments, from the stately mansion of mayor to the more humble, though not less noble, position</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1518 : page 120::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of school-teacher.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then, yes, we will rule the United States, and lay them at the feet of the Vicar of Jesus Christ, that he may put an end to their godless system of education, and sweep away those impious laws of liberty of conscience which are an insult to God and man.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Poor D'Arcy McGee was left almost alone when the vote was taken.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the Irish Roman Catholics were taught to consider San Francisco as their &quot;promised land,&quot; and the rich inheritance God had in store for them.  The consequence is, that when you find only a few American, German and English millionaries in San Francisco, you count more than fifty Irish Catholic millionaries in that city.  It is to San Francisco that you must come to have an idea of the number of great and powerful organizations with which the Church of Rome is preparing herself for the impending conflict, through which she hopes to destroy the system of education, and every vestige of liberty and human rights in the United States, as she bravely and publicly announced it not long ago in her most popular</font><br />

There is, ere long, to be a State religion in this country, and that State religion is to be Roman Catholic.  The Catholic is to wield his vote for the purpose of securing Roman Catholic ascendency in this country.  All legislation must be governed by the will of God, unerringly indicated by the Pope.  Education must be controlled by Catholic authorities; and, under education, the opinions of the individual and the utterances of the press are included.  Many opinions are to be furnished by the secular arm, under the authority of the church, even to war and bloodshed.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Catholic</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">World,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> July, 1870.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;While a State has rights, she has them only in virtue and by permission of the superior authority, and that authority can only be expressed through the church.  Protestantism of every form has not had and never can have any right where Catholicity has triumphed, and therefore we lose the breath we spend in declaiming against bigotry and intolerance and in favor of religious liberty, or the right of any man to be of any religion as best pleases him.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Catholic</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Review,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> July, 1870.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to more easily drill the Irish Catholics, and prepare them for the impending conflict, the Jesuits have organized them into a great number of secret societies.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Almost all these secret associations are military ones.  They have their headquarters in San Francisco, but their rank and file are scattered all over the United States, from the Pacific to the Atlantic ocean.  They number 700,000 soldiers, who, under the name of United States Volunteer Militia, are officered by the most skilful and able generals of the great Republic.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SOLOMON AND HIS WRITINGS--PROVERBS,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ECCLESIASTES AND SOLOMON'S SONG.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   These three productions come down to us from Jewish archives of sacred religious literature; and, notwithstanding the imperfections of the writer, they come with clear indications of divine supervision and inditement. The wisdom expressed is above that which is natural to our fallen humanity. It is not necessary to the reverent study of the moral philosophy therein set forth that we should either forget or ignore the defective moral character of Solomon; for even the story of his life with its checkered manifestations of virtue and vice is no inconsiderable part of the lesson of these books.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `1 Kings 3:11,12` we have the assurance of the divine inspiration of the wisdom of Solomon: &quot;And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">behold,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have done according to thy word.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.&quot;  But while we recognize and duly appreciate the wisdom of Solomon, we also mark his typical character, and perceive that only as a type of Christ could the fulness of the promise belong, of wisdom and riches superior to any preceding or succeeding him.  In this light the statement of our Lord (`Matt. 12:42`)--&quot;A greater than Solomon is here&quot;--is in perfect harmony with `1 Kings 3:12`.  His peaceful and prosperous reign, his famed wisdom and his marvelous wealth and glory were typical of the Millennial reign of Christ, though it all falls far short of the glory of the antitype-- as types always do.  As a type, the peace of his reign in contrast with the warlike reign of his father David is strikingly similar to the predicted peace of Christ's reign in contrast with the turmoil and war and confusion</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1517 : page 122::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of the Gospel age which precedes and prepares the way for the reign of his Son and for the building and establishment of the glorious temple of God, whose living stones are now being made ready, even as David similarly prepared the materials with which Solomon built the typical temple.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Song of Solomon, though in the form of an oriental love song, is really an allegorical representation of the mutual love of Christ and the Church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Book of Ecclesiastes seems to have been written in later life, when the heart had grown sick with excess of sensuous pleasures and the lack of the real happiness which comes from a close and perfect walk with God, when he turned from all his riches and honors with the sad refrain, &quot;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.&quot;  From his own experience he proves the truth of his theme, and counsels to others a different course from that which he himself had pursued, saying, &quot;Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth....Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.&quot;--`Eccl. 12:1,13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Book of Proverbs was probably the latest production of Solomon, when not only the promised wisdom from above, but also an experience gained under very peculiar and varied circumstances found expression in numerous concise and pithy sayings for the guidance and instruction of all who would live godly.  These are frequently quoted and referred to in the New Testament.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WISDOM'S WARNING OF PRESENT DANGER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">II. QUAR., LESSON V., APR. 30, `PROV. 1:20-33`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.&quot; --`Heb. 12:25`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;The reverence of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The reverence of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.&quot;--`Prov. 9:10`; `1:7`; `Job 28:28`; `Psa. 111:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Book of `Proverbs` is a poem, the first nine chapters of which are a discourse on wisdom, which is personified.  (The major part of the Book consists of the proverbs of Solomon, some of which--`chapters 25-29` --were collected and added later by King Hezekiah.  `Chapters 30` and `31`, however, do not claim Solomon for their author.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been inferred that the personification of wisdom in this Book was meant to represent Christ; but when we consider that wisdom is one of the divine attributes, it is evident that wisdom existed even before our Lord Jesus, although he was the beginning of the creation of God, the first born of every creature.  But so perfectly did our Lord Jesus exemplify the divine wisdom that it is not at all strange that some have inferred that wisdom, here, personified Christ, instead of recognizing Christ as the personification of that wisdom which from eternity was an attribute of Jehovah.  It is described by the Apostle `James (3:17`) as coming &quot;from above,&quot; and as being &quot;first pure, then peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In contrast with this heavenly wisdom he places what the Apostle Paul (`1 Cor. 3:19`) calls &quot;the wisdom of this world,&quot; which James says &quot;descendeth not from above, but is earthly;&quot; and, worse than that, it is &quot;sensual;&quot; and, worse still, it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;devilish.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It is the kind of wisdom which delights in envying and strife and confusion and every evil work. (`Jas. 3:14-16`.)  It is the wisdom of selfishness which, regardless of the rights and interests of others, seeks to grasp and hold every thing for self. This kind of wisdom, Paul says, &quot;is foolishness with God; for it is written [`Job 5:13`], 'He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.'&quot; --`1 Cor. 3:19`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All of the fallen human nature have more or less of the earthly wisdom of selfishness, which disposition continually gravitates lower and lower unless it is resisted and displaced by the heavenly wisdom whose fruits are love, mercy and truth.  This heavenly wisdom, we are told, has its beginning in the reverence of the Lord.  That is, we must look away from our own narrow thoughts, plans and schemes and allow our minds to dwell upon the grandeur of God's benevolent, loving and glorious character until a gleam of his glory awakens in us a feeling of admiration, veneration and love, and then of longing to be conformed to his image. And while we, as God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faithful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> children, thus look and hold ourselves in position to receive the impressions from above, the divine likeness is traced upon our hearts, as we study God's revelation; and the heavenly wisdom begins to manifest itself in the peaceable fruits of righteousness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who thus reverence him, the Lord is pleased to recognize as his sons, and to acquaint them with his plans for their salvation through the great redemption which his</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1518 : page 123::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">wisdom provided; and to such the counsels of these Proverbs are addressed, while warnings are given to others.  Thus we read--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`CHAPTER 1:8,9`--&quot;My son, hear the instruction of thy Father [God], and forsake not the law of thy mother [God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">covenant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of justification and regeneration in which we are begotten to newness of life]: for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.&quot;  Those only are accounted sons, who are thus begotten of the truth and in covenant with God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSES 10-19`. &quot;My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not,&quot; etc.  The counsel here, while it has reference to all enticements of sinners, has special reference to a condition of things which was prophetically foreseen--not necessarily by Solomon, but by the Lord who indited the matter, merely using Solomon as his mouthpiece.  The picture drawn corresponds exactly with that condition of things predicted by other prophets, and by the apostles, which was to come to pass in the end or harvest-period of the Gospel age, when great Corporations, Trusts and Monopolies, on the one hand, and Unions and Labor Federations on the other, would offer their enticements to the iniquitous business of shedding innocent blood and fattening on the spoils of the slain.-- See `Jas. 5:1-6`; `Mal. 3:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These two parties are now addressing everyone: the Capitalistic party addresses its temptations only to those who have money and influence of which they desire to make use; the Labor-Union party addresses all others.  But the voice of the Lord, the voice of true Wisdom, says to all God's people: &quot;My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.&quot;  Both of these parties present </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">worldly-wise</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> arguments based on selfishness --opposed to justice as well as to love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Capitalism says, and truly, We have the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brains,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but are in the minority: we are prosperous, but less contented than ever.  Let us enlarge our ambitions; let us unify our interests so that our rule and prosperity may be prolonged, even though the masses are awaking and may attempt resistance, in this dawn of a new era.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Laborism says, and truly, If we were ignorant and asleep in the past, we are awake now; if we were contented in the past with less, we are discontented now with more. Let us unite our muscle and skill and squeeze Capitalism into subjection to us; let us appropriate the fruit of their brains.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Both are saying, &quot;Come with us [join our Union or Trust], let us lay wait for blood&quot; [for opportunities to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">squeeze the life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> out of those under our power: let us make, for instance, a &quot;corner&quot; in wheat; let us buy up all the wheat in the market, fix our own prices and so control the market that we can </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">financially kill</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the small dealers and wring the revenue out of the public--the masses, both rich and poor.  Or let us play this game in oil or corn or any other commodity. Or let us make a corner in the skilled-labor market, by getting up a strong Union and ordering a strike; by &quot;boycotting&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1519 : page 123::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">all who oppose us, and by financially killing fellow workmen who will not join with us.  Let us look out for Number One, --ourselves.  Thus both combinations seek to prey upon each other for selfish ends, and generally to the disregard of justice].  &quot;Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause.&quot;  [Let us watch for our opportunity to take advantage of their ignorance of our movements, etc.  And generally it is the innocent who suffer most from such conspiracies.] &quot;Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole as those that go down into the pit.&quot;  [Present efforts are not for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">existence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> merely (for all are prosperous as never before), but for control.  Capitalism wants full control, and Laborism wants no less.  Each would swallow up the smaller of his own kind, and then effectually crush the other.  Thus, say they], &quot;We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil.&quot;  Thus, like ocean wreckers, they would grow rich upon the losses and injuries of others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Union&quot; is the watchword of both these great opposing parties.  Both sides cry (`Verse 14`):--&quot;Cast in thy lot with us; let us all have one purse&quot;[--let us put our money and skill together; thus only we can succeed, and control the markets, and reap the harvest]. But what saith the Lord?--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path; for their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.  Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.  [Each party can see the devices of the other, and each &quot;snare&quot; and device will be check-mated by the other side; and ultimately each party will become entangled in the snare set for the other.  As we read,--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But they [these conspirators] lay wait </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for their [own] blood;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they lurk privily for</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1519 : page 124::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their [own] lives.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain, who taketh away the life [or living] of the owners thereof&quot; --for the time is coming when the overwhelming numbers of those oppressed by these systems will arise in their fury like the raging waves of the sea, and anarchy will prevail--the predicted &quot;time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation.&quot; (`Dan. 12:1`.)  And who but the blind cannot see this very trend of events to-day? But who but &quot;the wise&quot; will heed these instructions of the Lord--the instructions of Wisdom?--`Dan. 12:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Wisdom [the voice of righteousness and of prudence--the voice of God] crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets; she crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates, in the city she uttereth her words.&quot;  This is truer to-day than at any other time in the world's history. Never before were the obligations of human brotherhood forced upon the attention of all men as they are to-day; and men are coming </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to see,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though they be not free to admit it, that the only solution of the great social problem now before the world is found in the &quot;golden rule.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We will have to act on that new rule we hear so much talk of in the papers nowadays,&quot; said a business man recently to a perplexed associate.  &quot;What's that?&quot; said his friend.  &quot;The golden rule,&quot; he replied, and his friend assented.  Yes, the &quot;golden rule&quot; is coming to the front, even in the newspapers, and men are obliged to consider it, whether they are ready to act upon it or not.  Thus wisdom crieth in the streets in the city--everywhere--saying,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 22`. &quot;How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity [--will you prefer to remain in ignorance of the just and right ways of the Lord]? and the [proud] scorners delight in their scorning [of justice and truth], and fools hate [that real] knowledge [which cometh from above, preferring the ways of selfishness]?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 23`. &quot;Turn you at my reproof.&quot; But they will not turn, because, as the Psalmist says (`Psa. 2:1-3`), they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;imagine a vain</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thing&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--they &quot;take counsel together against the Lord and against his Anointed [King, who has come to rule in righteousness, and whose presence and power is now </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forcing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon the minds and consciences of men the perplexing questions of this eventful hour, and their only right solution].&quot;  However, they will not be permitted to plead the excuse of ignorance of the right ways of the Lord; for the Lord says,--</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSES 24-27` are in exact agreement with the prophecy of `Psalm 2:4,5` showing not only that men will not heed the reproofs and counsels of this hour, but also predicting the disastrous results that will ensue. When the Lord has clearly set before men the momentous issues of this &quot;day of preparation,&quot; and they have disregarded them, and scorned the reproofs which the occasional outbreaks of dissatisfaction and discord shall have brought, then he will begin to speak to them in more positive and commanding tones, saying--&quot;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">calamity;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I will mock when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your fear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cometh --when your fear cometh as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">desolation,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and your destruction cometh </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as a whirlwind;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when distress and anguish cometh upon you.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The thoughtful observer of the present social and political aspect of the world can easily see that if the voice of Wisdom and Prudence be not heeded among men the culmination of the present unrest will be a terrific </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whirlwind.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  (See also `Jer. 25:31,32`.) &quot;He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.  Then shall he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">speak unto them</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> IN HIS WRATH, and vex them in his sore displeasure.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSES 28-32`. It will not avert the trouble for men to call upon the Lord then.  If they despise his counsel and reproofs to such an extent as to make necessary the exhibition of his wrath and righteous indignation for their correction, the Lord will not cease to scourge them because of their crying, but the penalty of their evil courses shall be given in such measures as to make a lasting impression.  It will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be &quot;a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation;&quot; &quot;no, nor ever shall be&quot; (`Dan. 12:1`; `Matt. 24:21`), because so thorough will be the correction that it will never again need to be repeated.  &quot;Therefore shall they eat </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the fruit of their own way</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [for the &quot;whirlwind&quot; of trouble will be the natural</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">result of their selfishness], and be filled [to satisfaction] with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their own devices.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  For the turning away of the simple [from their ignorance will be to the earthly wisdom of selfishness and not to the heavenly wisdom with its fruit of love and peace, and will work their injury.  It] shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.&quot; Their own feet will be caught in the snares they had set for others.  The very fact that, by their selfish, oppressive and unrighteous course, they were able to amass great fortunes will, by inciting the jealousy and hatred of the masses, make them a prey in the time of trouble--special targets for the venomous arrows of hatred.--`Jas. 5:1-6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 33` is a promise in which the few, who are wise enough to heed the instructions of Wisdom, may take comfort, even in the midst of the calamities that shall overwhelm the world.  &quot;The Lord knoweth them that are his,&quot; and &quot;The angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that are his, and delivereth them.--`Psa. 34:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The voice of heavenly Wisdom found clear and forcible expression through the lips of our Savior, who was the personification of God's wisdom as well as of his love.  His message was that Love, not Selfishness, should be the rule of life, if true happiness would be obtained.  &quot;Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them&quot; states this law in practical form.  It has sounded down the centuries since, awakening thought and civilization wherever heard.  It is the greatest </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">leveller</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">equalizer;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for it ignores class and caste.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But alas! many respect it merely because it lifts them up; and, when getting up from the slough of despond themselves, they forget to practice this precept toward others who are lower down than they.  Thus many have used and are using the precept of Love in a selfish spirit.  They desire that those more favored shall exercise this principle of Love toward them, but they will not exercise it themselves toward those above or those below their own social plane.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Only the &quot;little flock&quot; are to any appreciable extent even seeking to obey in spirit this voice of God--this voice of heavenly Wisdom: and these are often misjudged and misunderstood, as was their Lord and Redeemer, by the world in general, whose motive power is Selfishness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The civilized world stands to-day in a false position: professing to be Christ's Kingdom and to be ruled by his law of Love, it is really the kingdom of the Prince of this world--Satan--and operates in general under his law of Selfishness.  God will demonstrate this as soon as he has finished the selection of the &quot;Bride,&quot; the &quot;Body&quot; of Christ.  He will show the difference between the holding of a truth in unrighteousness and the practice of a truth in its real spirit or intent.  The result will be the breaking into pieces of these false kingdoms of Christ (`Rev. 19:15`), the establishment of the true, spiritual Kingdom of Christ, the full enlightenment of all the people and the full establishment of the law of Love, in fact as well as in name.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is as a means toward this end that God is now permitting the world to run riot in the spirit of this world (Selfishness) that the counsel of heavenly Wisdom may be justified when those moved by earthly wisdom (Selfishness) shall be snared in their own devices.</font><br />

Those who have this kind of wisdom--viz., that attitude of heart and mind which fits us to receive the instruction of the Lord and to profit by it--are sure to get understanding of whatever truth is meat in due season for them.  &quot;The wise shall understand.&quot;  And in the understanding of God's ways there is joy and peace and blessing which the world can neither give nor take away. `Verse 18` is a beautiful reference to the restitution to the trees of life and the Edenic bliss, of all who shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;lay hold upon&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;retain&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that heavenly wisdom of meekness and entire submission to the will of God.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The simple teachings of these proverbs are so plain as to need no explanation; but they are worthy of careful and prayerful pondering. They suggest a series of questions for self-examination which every child of God would do well to propound to himself in the quiet retreat of his accustomed place of prayer.  Let him not ask himself, Am I </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in every thought, word and deed, knowing that none of the fallen are so; but let him ask (`verse 1`), Do I love instruction and knowledge? am I seeking for it daily in the line of God's Word and providences? and am I ready to consider and heed reproof rather than to spurn and resent it?  `VERSE 2`. Are the purposes of my heart all pure and upright, bringing with them a constant sense of the Lord's favor?  `VERSE 3`. Am I rooted and grounded in the principles of righteousness, so that I will not swerve and cannot be moved? `VERSE 4`. Am I faithfully acting my part in my station in life--in my relationships to my fellow-men and my family?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 5`. Am I keeping a vigilant guard over my thoughts, that they stray not into forbidden paths?  `VERSE 6`. Am I ever ready to defend the righteous against the snares of the wicked?  In these days when the wicked are devising perverse doctrines to overthrow the faith of the righteous, am I zealous in my endeavors to establish them in the right ways of the Lord?  `VERSES 7 and 8` are precious promises to the righteous. `VERSE 9`. &quot;He that is despised and laboreth for himself is better than he that aimeth after honor and lacketh bread.&quot;  How true!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 10`. The truly righteous extend their tender mercies to the lower creation, as well as to human kind.  `VERSE 11`. The true child of God is no idler or visionary dreamer.  `VERSES 12-14`. The rewards of virtue and the penalties of wrong-doing are sure to follow, sooner or later, and every act will meet its just deserts in due time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 15` cannot be too carefully considered --&quot;The way of a fool is right in his own eyes.&quot;  Herein is the danger of an evil course: it is deceptive to those who take it: the wrong-doer, having succeeded in justifying himself, finds the downward course smooth and slippery, until the retracing of his steps becomes almost impossible.  &quot;But he that hearkeneth unto the counsel of the Lord is wise.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">`Golden Text`</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is very suggestive.  A righteous life may indeed be compared to a tree of life of whose virtues others may partake and live.

No such stumbling stones as enticing saloons will then be permitted to stand in the way to tempt the weak.

Few, if any, women of the Lord's choice--few of those who will be of his &quot;little flock&quot;--will have all the points of Lemuel's ideal woman.</font><br />

At about the same time you and others of the Church were commemorating the death of our precious Redeemer, we, in this place, were assembled for the same purpose, there being twenty-two present, seven of whom symbolized by immersion the entire consecration and baptism of their wills into Christ.</font><br />

We spent parts of two days in study and thanksgiving, ending last evening by keeping our Lord's supper in commemoration of his death.  After a careful study of the symbols, bread and wine, discerning the Lord's broken body and shed blood, realizing that the whole body or &quot;loaf&quot; is to be broken as the head has been, and thanking God for the gift of his Son and for the privilege of being broken in his service, we gladly partook of the emblems.

The meeting was opened by an appropriate hymn, followed by prayer; then another hymn, after which a portion of Scripture was read and a suitable article selected from the TOWER.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We considered the true import of the emblems, how they not only signified our Lord's sacrifice by which we are justified to human life and all its rights, but also how they signified our own consecration to be joined in sacrifice with him and to be dead with him.  With additional remarks I endeavored to make the subject clear, and as plain as possible.  After the lesson we sang another hymn, then prayed, after which the sacrament was administered.  Then a final prayer and closing hymn.</font><br />

A few days later a gentleman called to thank me for the tract I had left at his office, and desired to know whether he could not get more for his Sunday School.  Have supplied him with 150 copies of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thy Word is Truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which he has promised to distribute next Sunday.  I hope some good may result therefrom.  On a separate sheet I enclose his subscription to the TOWER.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--For the Memorial Supper and all day Friday meetings, we obtained the use of a small Baptist meeting house. About sixty brethren and sisters of this city and vicinity met to commemorate the Lord's death. We had a very blessed season, the Lord manifesting his grace among us.  On Friday about forty gathered for a season of Bible study and communion.  Friday evening we had baptism services, and fifteen symbolized their immersion into Christ.  Since then four others have asked to be baptised.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With love and greetings in Christ,</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">KEEP ORDERS SEPARATE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We are always pleased to hear from TOWER readers everything pertinent to their spiritual welfare and the progress of the truth.  In fact, we are disappointed to get a mere business order, and nothing more, from personal friends. But please always keep your general letter separate from your business order.  This will be to your advantage, as well as ours.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">MARKED CLIPPINGS IN ENVELOPES.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Friends who have access to Literary Magazines and prominent daily papers often notice interesting items of news more or less related to the topics discussed in the TOWER; and many of them send these to the Editor.  This kindness is very helpful, and is highly appreciated. We suggest to these friends that, instead of sending the entire paper, they clip the interesting items, and write on the back, or on the margin, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the name and date</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the paper or magazine from which it is taken.  In an unsealed envelope, one cent postage will do.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ADDRESSES FOR FREE READING MATTER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Many of the friends send in long, written and printed lists of excellent addresses, of parties likely to become interested, to have TOWERS and TRACTS sent them.  This is an excellent work, and we are glad to send out matter freely to such.  But just now the office is so overcrowded with work that many of these lists must lie over for a long time, because no one has the time to address the wrappers.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We suggest, therefore, that our friends who have the time for it can help along the cause by writing the addresses in a plain hand on wrappers (about the center), and mailing us the addressed wrappers, which can readily be filled and sent out.  The wrappers should be about 5 x 10 inches; or address-labels could be written 1 x 3 inches, which we could have pasted on wrappers.  These can be mailed to us at the rate of two ounces for one cent.  Those who have many addresses, but who cannot procure suitable paper, may drop us a postal card, and we can send what is needed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This, of course, does not apply to cases where only a few names are sent in, nor when the sender lacks the time for writing the labels.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Colporteurs, who would water the seeds of truth which they are planting, should be careful to note those they meet who seem to be specially consecrated to the Lord, and should send in their addresses for TOWER samples.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">1893 &quot;DAILY BREAD CALENDARS&quot; FREE.</font></b><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Messrs. Ward and Co., of New York City, importers of &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; Calendars, for 1893, have kindly donated to our readers the remnant of their stock of these calendars. So now whoever will send five cents each for the mailing may order them of us.  If several TOWER readers choose to order together, they may do so.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course over one-third of the year is gone, but daily texts for over two hundred days are as good as ever.  This food, taken at or before breakfast, should mean a blessing for the entire day.  These Calendars retail generally at 35 to 50 cents, plus postage.</font><br />
