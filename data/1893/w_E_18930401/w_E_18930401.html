<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question.&quot;--`Acts 24:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked.&quot;--`Acts 17:32`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--The prophet David &quot;spake of the resurrection of Christ: that his soul was not left in hades.&quot;--`Acts 2:31`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--Christ was proved or &quot;declared to be the Son of God with power...by the resurrection from the dead.&quot;--`Rom. 1:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;Now if Christ be preached, that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?&quot;-- `1 Cor. 15:12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;But if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen.&quot;--`1 Cor. 15:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;And if Christ be not risen, then is our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">preaching</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> vain;--and your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is also vain;-- and we are false witnesses;--and ye are yet in your sins; and they that are fallen asleep in Christ are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perished.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`1 Cor. 15:14-18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;But Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is risen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the dead, and become a first-fruits of them that slept.&quot;-- `1 Cor. 15:20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;For since by a man [Adam] came death, by a man also [Christ] came the resurrection of the dead.&quot;--`1 Cor. 15:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;The God and Father of our Lord Jesus ...hath begotten us again unto a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hope of life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&quot;--`1 Pet. 1:3`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--The Apostles &quot;taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection of the dead.&quot;--`Acts 4:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--At Athens, Paul &quot;preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection.&quot;--`Acts 17:18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--Paul said, &quot;I count all things but loss... that I may know him [Christ] and the power of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection;...if by any means I might attain unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [chief] resurrection of the [chief] dead.&quot;--`Phil. 3:8-11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;Blessed and holy are all they that have part in the first [chief] resurrection.&quot;--`Rev. 20:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just [justified believers] and the unjust&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unjustified].--`Acts 24:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--Some &quot;concerning the truth have erred, saying, that the resurrection is past already.&quot;-- `2 Tim. 2:18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No other doctrine is made so prominent in the New Testament as that of the Resurrection; except it be that of the second coming of our Lord and his kingdom glory, or his first advent and sacrifice for sins.  And yet, so far has modern popular theology drifted away from that of our Lord and his Apostles that, the resurrection of the dead is scarcely ever preached upon today; and it would be a great convenience, indeed, to many ministers of all denominations, if the entire doctrine of the resurrection could be expunged from the Bible: It would save them from many perplexing questions which they can only ignore or seek to evade, instead of answering them.  What a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proof</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this furnishes that the Bible is not what infidels assert--the work of knavish priests.  Had such made it they would have made it more to their pleasement --to support their theories.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1508 : page 100::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FALSE VIEWS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   If the reader ever heard one sermon on the resurrection from any so-called &quot;orthodox&quot; pulpit he was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">remarkably favored.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And yet that is scarcely true, either, for what he heard was probably such a medley, such a confusion, that his ideas were worse confounded after hearing than before.  Such exceptional ones probably heard such a discourse as was reported in the public press about two years ago, delivered by a very learned and able Presbyterian Doctor of Divinity to a Brooklyn audience.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This D.D. explained that the resurrection will consist in a regathering and revivifying of all the bones and sinews and flesh and skin, etc., that ever constituted human bodies, regardless of how they had been disposed of, by fire or mouldering or otherwise: No matter if parts had been destroyed by accident or eaten by</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1509 : page 100::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">fishes or beasts of prey; or if they had rotted and gone as fertilizer into various fruits, vegetables, grasses, etc., and thus been over and over again transformed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He explained &quot;the last day&quot; to mean a final twenty-four hours before the burning up of the world, and pictured that an after portion of that twenty-four hours would be devoted to a work of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judging</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the world, while the forepart would be occupied by the resurrection work; and he pictured the air black with hands, arms, feet, fingers, bones, skins, sinews, etc., of the billions who have lived and died, seeking the other parts of their bodies; and that then the souls would come from heaven and hell and be imprisoned in those resurrected bodies.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What an unscriptural and nonsensical view! And yet, how could the man think or preach differently on the subject seeing that he believed firmly in a &quot;resurrection of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which very words nearly all &quot;orthodox&quot; creeds of &quot;Christendom&quot; recite?  And how could a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be resurrected in any other way than by gathering together again the various parts and members which once composed it?  In no other way, of course.  And if the &quot;resurrection of the body&quot; is the resurrection specified in the Bible, we as well as others are shut up to the nonsensical and ludicrous view expressed by the Brooklyn D.D., as above stated.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE BIBLE DOCTRINE REASONABLE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   But the Bible contains no such statement; and such an inference is as unwarranted as it is unreasonable.  The reason which led to this statement that the resurrection would be merely that of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is quite evident.  The teaching had gradually crept into the Church that what seems to the five senses to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not such in reality: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">none are dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--saints nor sinners --but all more alive than ever, when to us they appear to be dead.  With this idea before the mind, many lose sight of the Scriptural teaching of a &quot;resurrection of the dead&quot; [beings, persons, souls]; and hence they altered it to suit their changed ideas, although it is still &quot;a very inconvenient doctrine to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">get around.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Because after having preached in the funeral discourse that the deceased is &quot;free now&quot; and &quot;no longer hampered and encumbered with a body,&quot; it is confusing to read from the Bible as a part of the funeral service about the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;hope</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of a resurrection of the dead,&quot; when they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hope</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that their friends are not dead, and would be glad to hope that they would never have anything more to do with what they term the &quot;prison-house of clay&quot;--the body.  It is confusing, too, to read the Apostle's words (specially intended and suited for such an occasion) about the second coming of Christ, and the blessing at that time, by a resurrection of &quot;them that sleep in Jesus&quot; (`1 Thes. 4:14-18`); and the expression, &quot;Wherefore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one another with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">these</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">words,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> only adds to their confusion; for no other words would be so comfortless to them; because of the unscriptural views they entertain.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But while, as we have seen, the theory of a &quot;resurrection of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the recovery and reorganization of the original atoms of matter-- is nonsensical, as well as without Scriptural warrant, let none so regard the doctrine of the resurrection of the soul or being, which is taught in the Bible, and which is reasonable.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ANASTASIS--RESURRECTION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In the Bible the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is found only in the New Testament; it is the translation of the Greek word, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the meaning of which, as given by Prof. Young's Concordance</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1509 : page 101::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a standard authority), is, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A standing or</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rising up.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Liddell &amp; Scott's Lexicon defines the word similarly, viz., </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A making to stand or</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rise up; awakening, restoration.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">*</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Other Greek words are used when referring to the temporary awakening of dead ones who afterward died again, as in the case of Lazarus, Jairus' daughter and others; but neither the Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor its English equivalent, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is used in such cases.  We are not questioning that the English word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is often used with only a limited signification; but we are calling attention to the restricted use of the Greek word.  And we insist that it is only by giving it the full weight of its meaning that the importance of our Lord's work as man's Redeemer can be fully appreciated. To say that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> given once for all by our Lord secured a resurrection </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(anastasis)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all, and then to define that word as merely signifying a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">re-awakening,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to a spark of life as now enjoyed, would be to rob the Lord of the honor of his great work, by robbing the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;anastasis&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of its full import.  Our claim is that this word contains the thought of a full restitution of all that was lost--human perfection --and not merely re-animation.  It was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that was lost that our Lord died to recover; and the promise of a resurrection is therefore the promise of the restoration of what was lost and redeemed.  This has been provided for all, and must be given or offered to all--whether then they accept of it or reject it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To get the full force of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;restoration,&quot; &quot;rising up&quot;--we must remember from what a height man has fallen into death.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection (anastasis)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> secured for mankind by their Redeemer is a full and complete raising </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (or restoration) to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all that was lost,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all, by one man's (Adam's) disobedience.  &quot;For as by a man [Adam] came death [with all the degradation which that word implies--mental, moral and physical, culminating in utter dissolution --utter loss], even so by a man also [the man Christ Jesus] came </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[i.e.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was secured] the resurrection&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--a complete restoration to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that was lost; a full </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rising up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the grand heights of perfection--the image and likeness of God at first enjoyed].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Millennial age is to be the resurrection day for the world of mankind; but it will be optional with each individual whether or not he ever attains this grand perfection, provided </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all in Christ.  It may at first seem strange to say that the dead will be obliged to co-operate in the matter of their own resurrection (to perfection) or else never obtain it; but such is the Scriptural representation.  The dead will not be required to aid or co-operate in their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awakening</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from their graves; for &quot;there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave&quot; (`Eccl. 9:10`; `Psa. 6:5`), and they, therefore, could neither assent to nor oppose their awakening.  That work will be done for the world by their glorified Redeemer, who declares, &quot;All that are in their graves shall hear the voice of the Son of Man and come forth: [that is, all will be awakened;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   *In one exceptional passage another word is used, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">egersis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Matt. 27:53`); but there are reasons for seriously doubting the genuineness of this verse and the `preceding one`. However, these peculiar verses are found in part in the oldest Greek Manuscript yet discovered; hence we may not discard them, although they are very difficult to harmonize with other scripture statements: for instance, if it was the earthquake which occurred at the moment of our Lord's death that opened those graves, it seems peculiar that they should stay thus three days before coming out of their graves after our Lord's resurrection (wrong or at least unusual word used for resurrection).  And they could not be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfected by anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because it is written that Christ should be the first to thus rise from the dead.  Then again, who were these &quot;saints&quot; or holy ones?  They were not holy ones of the New or Gospel Dispensation; for it did not begin, and the disciples did not obtain &quot;liberty to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sons</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God&quot; (`John 1:12`) until Pentecost, fifty days later.  And if they were holy ones of the Jewish or previous dispensations, their awakening could be only similar to that of Lazarus,--to die again; because the Apostle Paul, later than this, after recounting the most notable of the holy ones of by-gone times, declared, &quot;These all having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise [chief of which is the resurrection of everlasting life], God having provided some better thing for us [the Gospel Church], that they without us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">should not be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">made perfect.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Heb. 11:39,40`.)  Hence the holy ones of by-gone dispensations are not (in the divine plan as here stated) to experience their full resurrection until after the Gospel age--until the Millennial age; for the entire period of the Gospel age is set apart to the development and perfecting of the Church which is Christ's &quot;bride&quot; or &quot;body&quot; or &quot;temple.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1509 : page 102::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">but there will be two classes, who will be awakened under different conditions, as our Lord proceeds to show, saying,] they that have done good [that is, those consecrated ones who are good and acceptable to God through Christ] to a resurrection life [That is to say, this class will come forth from death with a perfect life, a completely resurrected or raised </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life, over which death shall no longer have any power or control]; and they that have practiced evil [surely this includes all of the fallen race except the few above referred to, the consecrated, holy ones] unto a judgment [or trial] resurrection&quot; [--an opportunity for full raising up if they will conform to the discipline and chastisements of that thousand-year judgment-day of Christ's reign].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In harmony with this, the true and full meaning of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--a complete or full raising </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">out of death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--is our Lord's expression to the Sadducees who inquired concerning a woman of many husbands, &quot;In the resurrection </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[anastasis]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whose wife shall she be? (`Luke 20:33`.) Our Lord avoided giving them a direct reply, perhaps because it would have required a long discourse concerning the future, for which they in their cavilling spirit were wholly unready, and perhaps because the due time for information respecting God's methods and dealings during the Millennial age were not yet due to be explained.  So our Lord's reply, in effect, was,--Ye err, because ye do not understand the Scriptures respecting how matters will then be, nor do ye appreciate the great power of God by which he is able to work all things according to the counsel of his own wise plan. Then, turning the subject away from the suppositionary case suggested by the Sadducees, our Lord took occasion to drop a word of instruction respecting the first or chief resurrection --the resurrection of the blessed and holy. (`Rev. 20:6`.)  A knowledge of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection would be meat in due season to them that stood by, while a direct reply to the question would not be, so our Lord said: &quot;The sons</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1510 : page 102::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of this period marry and are given in marriage, but those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that period and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the resurrection [anastasis]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">out from dead ones</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will neither marry nor be given in marriage; neither can they die any more: then, like the angels they will be, and sons of God--becoming sons by THE resurrection.&quot; The emphasis on &quot;resurrection&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; here, intensified by the expression </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;out from dead ones,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> leaves no room for doubt that the Lord referred to the First Resurrection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It will be perceived that in this statement our Lord omits any reference to the masses of the world and their opportunities for restitution to human perfection through a judgment-resurrection, a resurrection depending upon their co-operation, during Christ's Millennial reign, when, under him, their head, the saints (the holy ones who shall be accounted worthy of that first or chief resurrection to spirit conditions) shall judge the world.--`1 Cor. 6:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">RESURRECTION OF THE SOUL.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   There is nothing in the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor yet in the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to limit or in any way determine the nature or organism of the one who experiences resurrection.  If a resurrection of the body were predicted, then it would imply that exactly the same </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would be raised up: and, since the human family are all flesh-beings, it would imply that the very same bodies now possessed, with exactly the same atoms of matter, would be &quot;raised up.&quot; For the exact meaning of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must be born in mind, viz., </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;restored&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;raised up.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Liddell &amp; Scott.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If then the human body which dies were the thing to which resurrection is promised, nothing more or less than the same body with its same atoms, same defects, and the same peculiarities, could be expected: and, as a result, resurrection would be merely a renewal of present, unfavorable, fallen conditions.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But it is not the bodies of men that God promises to resurrect, but the men themselves --the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (in the English Bible translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">souls).</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It was Adam as a whole that sinned, --Adam, the living soul (being), and not merely his body.  It was Adam as a whole, as a living soul (being), that was sentenced to death, and it was the souls of his posterity yet in his loins, unborn (`Heb. 7:9,10`; `Exod. 1:5`; `1 Cor. 15:22`),</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1510 : page 103::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">that shared in him the penalty--&quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that sinneth, it shall die.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In harmony with this it would seem reasonable that when Christ redeemed man from this death-penalty, his soul must have paid man's penalty.  And so we find it clearly stated of our Redeemer:--His anguish was a &quot;travail of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul:&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was &quot;exceeding sorrowful, even unto death:&quot;  &quot;He poured out his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto death:&quot;  &quot;He made his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an offering for sin&quot;--a corresponding price for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Adam and all in him.  Thus God redeemed our SOULS </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">from destruction.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Psa. 49:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And it is those souls condemned in Adam's soul, and redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ's soul, that are to have a resurrection.  The Scriptures, when speaking of this, do not always use the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it is always implied; as, for instance, in the statement, &quot;As in Adam all [souls--beings] die, even so all [souls, beings] in Christ shall be made alive;&quot; and again, &quot;There shall be a resurrection of the dead [souls, beings], both of the just [souls, beings] and of the unjust [souls, beings].&quot;  Wherever character is expressed, as here by the words &quot;just&quot; and &quot;unjust,&quot; it is evident that not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bodies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are meant; for although we might say lean or fat, beautiful or homely bodies, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">character</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cannot be predicated of bodies merely: a body cannot be either just or unjust: the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soul</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">or being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is always understood where character is asserted or implied.  [What is the &quot;soul?&quot; will be more fully discussed at some future time.]</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   While a soul or being is more than a mere body, yet there can be no being, no existence, no soul, without a body.  But then, again, there are different kinds of bodies,--&quot;There is a natural [animal] body and there is a spiritual body&quot; says the Apostle, explaining this question. (`1 Cor. 15:44`.)  And the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">kind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of body determines the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the being or soul.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beings with spirit-bodies are spirit beings, or heavenly beings--as God, and angels; a further distinction being shown amongst these spirit-beings in that those possessed of inherent life (immortality,--God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ) are said to be &quot;of the divine nature&quot;--far above angels, etc. (`Eph. 1:21`.) And this is the grade of spirit body and being promised to the overcoming &quot;bride&quot; or &quot;body of Christ,&quot; the &quot;royal priesthood.&quot; `2 Pet. 1:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beings with the highest order of fleshly bodies, of the earth, earthy, are called human beings; --animal souls or beings; the highest of all earthly or fleshly beings or souls,--originally in God's likeness; and, as his representative Adam was, the King of Earth.--`Psa. 8:5,6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the human family is evidently a fleshly, earthly race, and not a heavenly or spiritual one; and since the inspired Apostle assures us of this fact, saying, &quot;That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is animal,&quot; &quot;the first man was of the earth, earthy.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:46,47`), we must conclude that, unless something should occur to work a change, the promise of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection (anastasis,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;raising </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;restoring&quot;), when applied to Adam and his family, would mean simply a restoration of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (soul) to its original powers possessed before his sin and fall--when he was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> likeness of his Creator, and upright.--`Gen. 1:27`; `Eccl. 7:29`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> merely signifies to &quot;raise </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as from a fallen to an upright, or from an imperfect to a perfect condition; and since it applies to the soul or being of man, it is evident that unless there be some </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of nature since the fall of the race in Adam, raising </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would imply nothing more and nothing less than raising all the way </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to that standard of perfection and divine likeness represented and lost in Adam.  Of the vast multitude of the human family it is true, that they are of the earth, earthy; of human nature, like father Adam, except that they have fallen farther from the divine image in which they were created in him.  But this is not true of all, as we shall see.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostles Paul and Peter clearly explain to us that during this Gospel age God has been selecting a peculiar people, a little flock, to be joint-heirs with Christ, their Redeemer and Lord, in the Millennial Kingdom, which is to bless all the families of the earth.  And they no less clearly assure us that those who shall be of that &quot;bride&quot; class will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">their resurrection, to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature, that thereafter they may be with their Lord, and be like him, and see him as he is.-- See `2 Pet. 1:4`; `1 John 3:2`.  Compare also our Lord's words in `John 17:24`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same authoritative teachers assure us that, in order to secure such a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their resurrection (necessary to all who will be members of that Kingdom), a certain </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must take place in them before death.  This latter </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is Scripturally called a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begetting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the spirit, and the resurrection </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is called a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">birth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the spirit.  That which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">born</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the spirit will be a spirit-being, and no longer a human-being.  As that which is begotten and born of the flesh is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so that which is begotten and born of the spirit is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spirit.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Nicodemus, and the Jews generally, thought that when the due time should come their nation would become God's Kingdom--a fleshly kingdom under a fleshly Messiah.  But our Lord corrected Nicodemus' error, and assured him that all who would ever become members of that Kingdom, or who should even see it, would have to be begotten and born again,--a second time,--of the spirit of God.--See `John 3:5-7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostles explain that the begetting to this new nature comes </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only to believers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> already justified by faith in the Redeemer; and that, while the justification of believers comes to each as a free gift through Christ, this begetting to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creatures &quot;of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature&quot; comes to us directly from the Father, and that as a result of our full consecration to him. The Truth, the word of God's grace,--&quot;our high calling which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of God&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--is the begetting and quickening influence which starts the new, consecrated life in all who are properly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exercised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thereby.  The Apostle says: &quot;The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`1 Pet. 1:3`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Gospel age is exclusively devoted to this work of begetting and quickening and preparing of the true Church, the &quot;little flock,&quot; for birth to the divine nature, and thus to an inheritance in the promised Kingdom which flesh and blood (souls or beings of human nature) cannot inherit, nor even see. (`John 3:3,5`.) The resurrection of the Church includes the resurrection of Christ Jesus, who is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Church which is his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Eph. 1:22,23`.) This resurrection is not only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chief</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection in the sense of being the grandest and most wonderful &quot;raising </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> far above human and angelic natures--to the very pinnacle of glory and power, the divine nature-- but it will also be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first in order.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And upon its completion, all other features of God's great plan for human salvation wait and depend.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This first (chief) resurrection began over eighteen centuries ago, when the head of the Church arose, the first-born from the dead. Since then, one after another, a &quot;little flock&quot; of believers, after sharing in justification under the New Covenant sealed by the Redeemer's sacrifice, consecrating themselves to the Lord and becoming joint-heirs with Christ in the Abrahamic Covenant (`Gal. 3:29`), have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and quickened to this course of action by the exceeding great and precious promises of God, and sealed by the holy spirit of promise, which continually, by God's Word</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1511 : page 104::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and providences, bears witness that they are &quot;accepted in the Beloved;&quot; and that if they suffer with him they shall also reign with him; --if they be dead with him they shall also live with him. (`Rom. 6:8`; `8:17`.)  &quot;Beloved, now are we the sons of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the divine nature, witnessed by the spirit of adoption which enables us to recognize God as our Father]; but it doth not yet appear what we shall be [what shall be the peculiarities of our new bodies which we shall receive when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">born</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the dead as sharers in Christ's resurrection], but we [do] know that when he [Christ] shall appear, we shall be like him; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we shall see him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as he is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [not as he was]; and none can see spirit beings as they really are except such as are also spirit beings--even as none except those begotten of the spirit can now understand spiritual things.--`1 Cor. 2:14`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">TWO ORDERS OR CLASSES RESURRECTED:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ONE IN THE HEAVENLY, THE OTHER</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">IN THE EARTHLY LIKENESS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Apostle Paul gives a most complete discourse on this subject. (`1 Cor. 15:12-28,35-55`.) First, he proves that faith in a resurrection</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1511 : page 105::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">is a part of Christian doctrine, without which the entire fabric would be senseless.  Secondly, having proved the doctrine, he shows that our Lord's resurrection is God's guarantee of a resurrection to all our race, for which Christ died.  He proceeds to prove this fact and its reasonableness (`verse 21`) in that as by Adam came death to all, so by the man Christ Jesus the resurrection blessing is made applicable to all.  Notice, however, that although a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to perfection is made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">applicable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to all, by God's plan, it does not follow that all will obtain it.  It is only for those who shall successfully pass a judgment or trial to prove their worthiness of it under God's conditions --the New Covenant.  It is made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">applicable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to all, in that the terms will be such that all may avail themselves of the offer, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Next the Apostle shows that &quot;as all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Adam died, even so all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ will be made alive </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[i.e., fully</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> escape death], but each in his own order or class.--`Verses 22,23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He next pointedly shows, in a few words, what we are here seeking to elaborate: namely, that only those who get into Christ by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;faith in his blood&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will ever get the perfect life which he has provided, and will make possible of attainment to all.  And he shows that of these who come into Christ, into the household of faith, there will be more than one class or order--each one in Christ will be made alive, or fully &quot;raised </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up&quot; out of death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his own proper class or order.  These orders he shows to be two.  The &quot;first-fruit&quot; class, the &quot;members of his body,&quot; will be first in order and first in rank.  Because associated with Christ in sacrificing, during this age, they shall be accounted worthy to have part in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection --the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chief</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection.--`Phil. 3:8-11`; `Rom. 6:5`; `Rev. 20:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Afterward [that is, next in order, or the remainder of those to be made alive in Christ, will be], those who are Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">during</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his [second] presence [during his Millennial reign]. Then will come the end [the finish of the great salvation which he began by the sacrifice of himself once for all], when he shall deliver the [Millennial] kingdom to God the Father,-- when he [Christ] shall have put down [by love or by force] all rule and all authority and power [opposed to righteousness, truth and love;--opposed to God and his perfect law]. For he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet.  [His Millennial Kingdom, having been arranged for the very purpose of releasing those who shall desire to be in harmony with God, when made fully aware of his real character and plan, and of destroying all who, under similar knowledge, are wilful opponents of God and righteousness, cannot cease until all these ends are fully accomplished.  The enemies to be humbled in the dust include not only evil forces, moral and physical, but also all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">persons</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who wilfully become associates in and parts of those evil things.  The enemies will therefore be both animate and inanimate.] Even the last enemy, THE death shall be destroyed: for he [the Father] hath subjected </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things under his [Christ's] feet.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was an easy matter for those whom Paul addressed to believe that when the Millennial Kingdom should be in operation sin and sinners would be brought low; but the point most difficult to them, and the one which the Apostle was now seeking to impress, was that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death which had reigned over and conquered the race through Adam's sin had now become an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemy,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an opponent of God's plan: and hence would surely be destroyed by the reign of Messiah.  Death had not always been an enemy or an opposer of God's plan: once it was his servant, executing upon fallen man the penalty pronounced by God.  But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> since Christ had paid the ransom price for Adam and for all condemned in him, this Adamic death is no longer to be accounted as a servant of God to execute justice, but as an enemy which the Redeemer of men is fully authorized and empowered to destroy--thus liberating from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">its</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bondage all for whom he died--&quot;every man,&quot; all who died in Adam. (`Rom. 8:31-39`.)  This destruction of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death from which Christ redeemed us, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death, does not have any thing to do with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Death, to which, under Christ's rule, all will be subjected who, when released from the Adamic death and granted a new trial for life, are found wilful sinners.  The second death will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">friend</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1511 : page 106::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">rather than the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of all who love righteousness; for in it &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abominable,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and they only shall be destroyed--and that utterly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verses 27,28`, show that Jehovah alone is superior to our Lord Jesus, and that after subduing sin and death Christ as well as all things will be subject to the Father, who will be recognized as THE GREAT I AM, in whom the all in all of majesty and power will inhere.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Having thus proved the fact of a general resurrection, and having shown the two orders-- the Christ order, including every member of the body of the Christ who is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and a sharer of his glory and divine nature, and having shown the other class who will get life in Christ during the Millennial reign, the Apostle comes to particulars respecting these two classes (`verses 35-54`), in answer to a supposed question--&quot;How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">First, he treats the two classes together, saying, It is with man in death and resurrection as with the planting of grain and its reappearance. If you sow barley you expect barley; if you sow wheat you expect wheat to come up. So of whatever kind or nature a person is when he dies, he will be of that same nature, perfected, in the resurrection;--a resurrection will be a raising up of the same </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">kind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that goes into death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All men are of the human nature, of the Adamic family, of the earth, earthy.  Hence, with the exception of those begotten by the word of divine promise to the new spiritual nature (and who by reason of this change belong to &quot;the order of Melchisedec&quot; and are &quot;new creatures in Christ,&quot; &quot;members of his body&quot;), all the race of Adam die in Adam's nature, human nature; and if raised up to perfection would attain the perfection of man-hood.  But those begotten of the spirit to the spiritual nature will, when resurrected, be perfect spirit-beings. To the Adamic seed God has given a grand and wonderful human or flesh body, whose grandeur may be conjectured if we can imagine all the grand qualities and gifts which we see exhibited exceptionally in poets, philosophers, musicians, orators, mathematicians and physical prodigies combined in one person.  These human qualities lost by all the race to a greater or less extent will still belong to those of the Adamic </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who shall be fully resurrected out of the death-loss sustained in Adam's fall.  But to the new seed, which is Christ (Head and members), God has promised a yet more glorious spirit-body, the wonders of which we but little comprehend as yet.--`1 John 3:2`; `1 Cor. 2:9-10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `verses 39-41`, the Apostle introduces a description of the first or chief resurrection, in which the Church is especially interested, and shows that as there are various grades of earthly beings (fish, fowl, cattle and man), of which man is the lord or chief, so also in the spirit realm there are various degrees or grades of beings--the angelic being one, and the divine nature chief of all.  So he reasons that as we can conceive of harmony and perfection, with variety, in the earth, perfect horses, dogs, cattle and men, so we can likewise conceive of similar variety in perfection amongst spirit beings. We may judge something of what human perfection will be by imagining all the wonderful powers of mankind exercised to the full by each. But although we know less about the spirit realm, we do know that spirits, powers and glories differ from human powers and glories. The glories yet diversities of the spirit world being well illustrated by those of the sun, moon and stars.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE FIRST RESURRECTION DESCRIBED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In `verse 42` the Apostle fully reaches his topic saying, &quot;Thus is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dead.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some who fail to see the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> classes or orders in resurrection, and who claim that all will obtain spirit bodies in resurrection, urge that the above words apply to all who shall ever be resurrected, and that the description following is therefore applicable to all.  But if the careful student will take his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emphatic Diaglott</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or any Greek New Testament he will see that the words &quot;resurrection&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; are both emphasized in `verse 42`; as though the Apostle would say, Thus will be the special or first resurrection, of the special class of the dead.  To ignore this feature of the Greek is to blind one's self to the real force of God's Word.  It may</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1511 : page 107::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">be asked, May it not have been a custom with the Apostle to use emphasis when speaking of the resurrection in general?  We answer, No;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1512 : page 107::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and refer the student to other instances of the use of the same expression without emphasis in the same chapter. (See `verses 12,13,21`.) And be it noticed that in each of these verses the words &quot;resurrection&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; do not refer to a special class and a special order of resurrection, as in `verse 42`.  Furthermore, notice that whenever the Lord or the Apostles refer to the resurrection of the overcomers, the word resurrection is in every case made emphatic, and when the word occurs in a general way it is without emphasis.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the following texts </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is without the Greek </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">article</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and hence shows no emphasis,-- indicates no special peculiarity: `Matt. 22:23`; `Mark 12:18`; `Luke 2:34`; `20:27`; `John 5:29`. (Here, instead of emphasizing the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by adding the article, the special resurrection is pointed out by calling it a resurrection of life, because those who share it will be perfected in life at once; the contrast being shown again in the statement that the others will come forth to a judgment-resurrection or a perfecting obtainable only through judgments, discipline, etc.); `Acts 17:32`; `23:6,8`; `24:15-21`. (As already noticed the Apostle is here showing that his faith in a resurrection or perfecting is not only for those </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> justified, but that it extends beyond this small class and includes a hope of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfecting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for many </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ignorant, sinful, unjustified), `Acts 26:23`; `Rom. 1:4`; `1 Cor. 15:12,13,21`; `Heb. 6:2`; `11:35`; `1 Pet. 1:3`; `3:21`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the following texts </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has the Greek </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">article,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> showing emphasis and indicating that the first or special resurrection is surely meant: `Matt. 22:28,30,31`; `Mark 12:23`; `Luke 14:14`. (This text should not be understood to mean that Simon would be rewarded for his kind act by a share in the special resurrection, but that he would get </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reward for it after </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> special resurrection of the Christ shall have introduced the new Kingdom--when Simon and the world in general will be granted full opportunity for life everlasting in and by a judgment-resurrection.); `Luke 20:33,35,36`; `John 11:24,25`; `Acts 1:22`; `2:31`; `4:2,33`; `17:18`; `Rom. 6:5`; `1 Cor. 15:42`; `Phil. 3:10,11`; `2 Tim. 2:18`; `Rev. 20:5,6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mark well that it is not our claim that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without the article, never refers to the Lord's resurrection; but that the emphasis when used with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> always marks the statement as relating to the chief or spiritual resurrection. The apostles frequently spoke of our Lord's resurrection without calling attention to the fact that it was of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">superior</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> kind, just as we frequently do.  They indeed often and properly enough use the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">egeiro</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in speaking of our Lord's resurrection (as in `Acts 5:30`); but this word simply means, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;to awaken, arouse,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stir</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Liddell &amp; Scott).  This word is used in speaking of the temporary </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awakenings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of our Lord's miracles; as, for instance, in referring to the awakening of Lazarus (`Jno. 12:1,9,17`), of Jairus' daughter (`Mark 5:41`) and of the son of the widow of Nain (`Luke 7:14`).  This word is also used without reference to dead people: for instance, when our Lord was asleep during the storm on the lake--the disciples </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;awoke [egeiro]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him&quot; and &quot;he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">arose [egeiro]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and rebuked the winds.&quot; (`Matt. 8:25,26`.)  &quot;It is high time to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awake [egeiro]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> out of sleep,&quot; the Apostle urges. (`Rom. 13:11`.)  And again he says, &quot;Awake </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[egeiro]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thou that sleepest.&quot; (`Eph. 5:14`) referring to the thoughtless.  These comments apply also to the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anistemi</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> frequently rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">arise, arose,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc., but never rendered resurrection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But not so with the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (resurrection): it is never used except with reference to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raising up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of dead beings,--souls.  And we hold that its use agrees in every instance with the thought of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> raising all the way </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to perfection (and that it never refers to a mere reanimation or awakening) except it be in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instance out of the forty-three above noted. That one instance is in `Heb. 11:35`, where </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occurs twice, rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised to life again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The first of these is generally understood to refer to the re-awakening of two children, by Elijah and Elisha; but we believe that had he referred to these the Holy Spirit would have guided the Apostle to the use of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">egeiro</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as in the case of Jairus' daughter</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1512 : page 108::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and the others awakened by our Lord.  We prefer, therefore, to understand the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anastasis</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> here the same as in the other forty-two uses of the word--a full raising up to perfection-- and hence must suppose that the Apostle means that certain women, although not sharers in the battles, were sharers in the losses and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --their faith in God's promises permitting them to look into the future and to trust God for the resurrection of their dead ones; indeed, to sorrow not as others who have no such hope.  This view finds support also in `verse 39`: &quot;These all, whose </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was attested, did not obtain the promised blessing, God having provided a superior portion for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [the bride, the body of Christ], that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without us might not be made perfect.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, dear readers, let us remember that the reward, &quot;Well done!&quot; and the chief resurrection are not for those who have a clear knowledge and strong faith, merely, but for those who through their knowledge and faith become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;overcomers&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in deed and in truth. But the more clearly we see that a full, complete resurrection of being is freely provided for all of Adam's race in our great Redeemer's sacrifice, the more we can appreciate that sacrifice and the more we should love and esteem both the Giver and the Gift.  And the more clearly we see that the attainment of the spiritual </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">plane</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of perfect being, to which believers during this Gospel age have been called, is dependent on three things--(1) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begetting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the spirit, under the sanctifying power of the word of his grace, (2) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">quickening</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to activity in God's service and to self-sacrifice by a still fuller appreciation and under the same sanctifying influences of the same spirit of the Truth, and (3) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a resurrection-birth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the perfection of the new nature to which we were begotten and quickened--the more grace it will give us in considering what manner of persons we should be, as copies of our Redeemer, if we would make our calling and election sure.  And the more clearly we see that a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">trial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or judgment in the present life is essential to a part in the chief resurrection, the more reasonable it will appear that all of the world, who during the next age will be granted an opportunity for everlasting life under perfect conditions, must have a trial or judgment, and that therefore the period of Christ's reign is the thousand-year judgment-day and that a judgment-resurrection will progress therein --the willing and obedient obtaining perfection and life at its close, the disobedient, rejecting that gracious provision, being then &quot;destroyed from among the people.&quot;--`Acts 3:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us who have been begotten of the Spirit, with the great Apostle, count all other prizes but as loss and dross that we may win Christ-- win a membership in that glorious body--and be found in him; if by any means (by fellowship in his sufferings) we may obtain a share in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection.--`Phil. 3:8`.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ISRAEL RETURNING TO THE HOLY LAND.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;There are now over 100,000 Jews in the Holy Land.  The Jewish population there is larger than it has been at any time since the end of the first century of the Christian era. Nearly four-fifths of them have gone thither from other countries within the last few years, and they have been going thither this year more steadily than ever before.  In former times only a small number of Jews were permitted to live in the country, but the restrictions upon their settlement in it and upon their ownership of land have been removed, and they are now at liberty to re-people it and take possession of it. The number of Jews who have returned to Palestine during the dozen years in which they have been free to enter has been greater than the number who returned after the Babylonian captivity, twenty-four centuries ago.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In the city of Jerusalem itself, according to a report of the British Consul there, the Jewish population is now fully 40,000, and a large part of the real estate in and around the city is in Jewish hands.  The number of synagogues, schools of learning, hospitals, and other public institutions is constantly increasing, the water system has been improved, new streets have been opened beyond the walls, telegraphs and electric lights have been introduced, several factories have been set up, and the new railway to Jaffa has already stimulated the activity of the population in various ways.  'Palestine will soon be ready for the Jewish race,' says Rev. Dr. Kelt, of the Episcopal Church of Jerusalem, in a letter to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">London Times.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The reports from the northern part of Palestine are favorable.  There is activity at Acre and along the route to Damascus.  The wheat raisers there are rejoicing in the prospect of finding markets for their crops; so are the raisers of olives and other fruits.  The soil in that region is well adapted to the growth of cotton.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A number of important public works have been undertaken in various parts of the country between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean; and we hear of yet other projects in which the Hebrew capitalists of England and France are prepared to invest all the money that may be needed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It will undoubtedly take a long time to regenerate Palestine, but we infer from the news received from Jerusalem that the work of regeneration has been begun.  It must take a good many years to give the predominance to the Jewish element in Palestine; but if the number of Jews there should increase for the next ten years at the rate at which it has increased during the last ten years, the Jewish population in the Holy Land will run over a million very soon after the opening of the twentieth century.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The shutting out from this country of the Jewish as well as other European immigrants, has already had an influence upon the Palestinian movement.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Since we have become new creatures in Christ we are finding new treasures--treasures of divine knowledge which will never pass away, treasures of experience and wisdom developing in us what the Lord recognizes as precious graces of character, treasures of good works that shall not be forgotten when the day of final reckoning shall make them manifest, and treasures of heavenly friendships that shall never be severed while the years of eternity roll.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">O what joy there will be in heaven when we find our treasures there, all safely kept where moth and rust could not corrupt and where thieves could not break through and steal.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the heavenly Banker says, Well done, good and faithful servant, and the treasure of heavenly approval and love and commendation sinks down deep in our enraptured hearts, tell me, will we not feel that the measure of joy which began even here and was numbered</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1513 : page 110::</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">saint then glorified greets us with tender, grateful love, saying, You helped me hither, or You recovered me from falling when my feet had well nigh slipped; and when another and another of these treasures throng about us to bid us welcome to their midst, will we not indeed rejoice over the investment of toil or care or effort of any kind which has brought such results.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides the treasures of friendship which will never die, there will be treasures of love that will never grow old, treasures of esteem for the sake of our work and personal sacrificing that will never be forgotten, treasures of experience that will serve us eternally, treasures of wisdom that will enrich us forever, treasures of divine approval that will wreath a halo of glory around us which shall never pale, and treasures of glory, honor and immortality beyond our present powers to fully appreciate.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us heed the Master's words--&quot;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal; for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&quot;</font><br />

I read </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Plan of the Ages&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with very great interest and pleasure: for it has confirmed many ideas I already possessed, and developed others which were latent and vague in my mind.  I am happy and thankful to say that since my early youth, I was enabled to acquire, through God's grace and my dear father's instrumentality, much knowledge, which gave me much higher ideas of the Almighty's wisdom, justice and mercy than are generally possessed by nominal Christians. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Plan of the Ages&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> did not come to me, therefore, as a revelation, but as a joy-giving confirmation of ideas I had already acquired.

I desire to say to Brother and Sister R__________that I received much light and strength in coming to the Lord, through the aid of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Plan of the Ages.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It carries with it a substantial blessing to every reader who is seeking light and truth with a sincere heart.  It takes away the hideous thought, that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is a monster of cruelty, ignorance and injustice,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">and reveals, instead, that he is wisdom, justice and love.  Truly the light shines more and more unto the perfect day.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Great and mighty works has he wrought in me, and he is doing the same for others here, all so quietly, yet surely.  Through the power of God and the grace of our blessed Lord, I am free from bondage to the old nature. I know and fully realize why the Apostle with such vehemence urged upon all to put on the whole armor of God.  As a man, I have been exercised until I look upon my past life with shudders of horror.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1513 : page 111::</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">I received in due course your postal card and Tracts, for which I beg to express my thanks.  The papers were carefully read, and, I am frank to say, made clear to me many things which formerly appeared dark and unmeaning.  As soon as I possibly can, I shall arrange for a regular supply of your semi-monthly WATCH TOWER; and I mean to procure, as soon as I can, the present volumes of Dawn.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am fully convinced that my perusal of the first volume of DAWN opened my eyes to the truth.  I read the book eagerly, and consulted nearly all the Scripture references as I went along.  The result was an awakening. I thought much over it, and perceived at last what it was to walk in the way of life.  The Bible became like a new revelation to me.  I read it with feelings of delight.  It is not now a labor or a duty, as once it was, but I turn to it with eagerness and joy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are souls here inquiring for the way of life.  I speak of those who, quietly, and without intending to inform any one of it, are seeking God.  They give evidence of sincerity. These I try to reach, for I consider the soil to be such as will bear fruit.  As for the others (the great majority) all that seems possible now is to hope and pray that God will open a way whereby their hearts can be reached.  Yours in His name,    __________.</font><br />

I have read and studied </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Plan of the Ages,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until the facts therein stated are perfectly clear to my mind.  At first I rebelled against its teachings, could not have it so and would not.  Then I said, If this is the truth, I must take it, whether it is palatable or not --like bitter medicine to a sick body: hard to take, but good in its effects.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is what my sin-sick soul needs; and it shall have it is the decision of my sanctified will.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">I did not intend to write you a letter (nothing but an order), but I know it will cheer you to know that your book has done me good, and that I have lent it to several others who have read it with benefit.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">May God bless the work you are doing, and bring many to the truth as it is in Christ Jesus our Lord, is my prayer.</font><br />

At first reading of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;An Answer to Ingersoll&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I thought it too liberal, but on reading </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Pulpit Infidelity&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I apologize for any uncharitable thoughts I might have entertained.  I am a learner, and anything that will teach without injury I want: others I do not want.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Thanks for samples of ZION'S WATCH TOWER received.  At first I suspected a snare, and was ready at the first appearance of the cloven hoof or wolf in sheep's clothing to &quot;flee away;&quot; for nowadays we have to watch. But I keep in mind that as I am Christ's, no man is able to &quot;pluck me out of my Father's hand.&quot;  So I send you $1.00 for the three volumes of MILLENNIAL DAWN and Tracts.  Have read February TOWER; and though on first reading its doctrine seemed strange, I find that it clears up many passages of Scripture hitherto not understood.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I hereby acknowledge the receipt of the DAWNS.  I do not know how to express myself: I am so delighted with them and your other publications.  It was really Providential</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1513 : page 112::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">that I saw your tract </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Wages</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of Sin.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  First I thought it was too Universalistic; then I thought it was too Purgatorial; and I did not know what to do until my regular Bible lesson (`Ezek. 15:44-45`) confirmed the tract.  I find it is just like Christ Jesus to be just to all men.  Oh! praise his name! the Scriptures began to unfold to my poor, benighted mind.  I know what it is to fellowship with him in joy and pleasure, and am learning (slowly to be sure) to suffer with him; and know that I am accepted in the Beloved.  I stand alone in my community, but I cease not to do the work he has appointed me, nor will I.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">***</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I have read the three DAWNS critically as I can, and I must say they have to a great extent revolutionized me; and, though your DAWNS struck me a little contrary at first, I soon got righted.  Oh, the blessedness of this truth!  He has led me in a way I know not, but he doeth all things well.  I have fought a good fight up to the present time and have the armor on awaiting his orders.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You may be and probably are spoken against; but I am with you: not that I have hastily adopted these teachings; but I was ready for the DAWNS.  I did not know what I wanted, but they filled the aching void.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have since shown my faith by my works, by handing in my resignation to the church to which I belonged, and am now free.  I want your prayers for me, that I may see you at the marriage of the Lamb.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER:--Thanks for the knowledge of which you are the channel.  A few weeks ago I came across your MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. I., and at the time I was struck with the facts therein enunciated, but did not take hold of them.  However, I could not get away from the thoughts induced by the first reading, and so determined to have another perusal; and how any rational being could fail to perceive that plan as set forth in the Scriptures I should be at loss to understand, if I had not had experience with the blinding effects of tradition.  &quot;Take hearsay for granted, and never mind searching the Book&quot; was my motto--and is that of many at the present time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True, I called myself a Christian, and did believe in Christ as a Redeemer, but I had absolutely no idea of the extent and benefits of the Redemption.  But now, thank God, I know in what my duty consists, and am striving to run the race, keeping only the goal in view.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am in daily contact with Spiritualists and others of similar beliefs, and some with no belief at all, and would ask for your prayers, that the light may shine, and that I may be given the requisite strength to keep my light shining--not burning, simply, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shining.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  I shall not forget you; and may you long be spared to continue the work the Master has given you to do.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--The DAWN series has brought great light and joy and peace to our home.  We had been studying and groping for some time, to find what the second advent of Jesus Christ meant to the world; and since we have come to &quot;understand,&quot; we have had the pleasure of helping to lead some others into the Truth.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--Some time since, I bought MILLENNIAL DAWN of one of your colporteurs, and have given the three volumes a careful reading; and though your ideas are somewhat different from my own, yet I feel drawn towards you, as one after my own heart.  For many year past, I have been making myself ready for the appearing of the glorious Bridegroom, having been connected with those expecting his soon appearing since 1842.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While I have been a believer in restitution and in the reign of Jesus and his bride over the restored earth, I have not attached such importance to the ransom-price paid by the blessed Redeemer for all mankind, as I ought to have done.  Truly it is the goodness of God that should lead men to repentance, and not his supposed wrath.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear Brother, everything I have is on the altar, and has been since I was called out, seventy-three years ago.  I still holding myself ready to do my blessed Master's will, to follow him through evil as well as good report, and to say at all times, &quot;Not my will, but thine be done.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Your brother in hope,    DANIEL PERINE.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CHURCH STATISTICS OF THE U.S.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Dr. Carroll, Superintendent of religious statistics of the last census, presents some interesting facts.  The membership of the Presbyterian, the Methodist Episcopal, the Reformed, the German Reformed, the Lutheran, the Congregational, the Disciples, the Roman Catholic and the Jewish churches shows a total of 12,487,382; while of this total the Roman Catholics are accredited with 6,250,045, or more than one half.  These are the figures given by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christian at Work.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE OUTLOOK.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christian Union</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for April 1st, in the &quot;Outlook,&quot; says, after speaking of the bitter opposition, by a member of the German Reichstag, to the Jews: &quot;There are many indications that the anti-Semitic feeling in Germany is spreading.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same journal, speaking of affairs in Belgium --the working classes demanding universal suffrage--says, &quot;In the event of a failure to make that concession, very serious industrial disturbances will undoubtedly take place.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JEWISH RIOTS IN RUSSIA.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   A St. Petersburg dispatch, dated March 24, announces a peculiar riot.  It says: &quot;For the first time in the remembrance of Russia, Hebrews have assumed the role of rioters--in the town of Jarnitz.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Hebrews residing in that part of Russia are, what with their own natural shiftlessness and the various late prohibitive laws which have kept them out of their regular easy and paying businesses, in a somewhat precarious condition anyway nowadays.  They live mostly a from-hand-to-mouth existence, and have nothing to fall back upon in case of need.  The late failure of the crops and the consequent famine have, therefore, come down with crushing force upon them, and their sufferings have been terrible.  On top of this the winter has been extremely cold, and this suffering has been added to the others.  At last the cold, hunger and need drove the poor inhabitants of the above mentioned town of Jarnitz, which may be taken as a sample of all the other towns of that region, to an extreme step.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE POOR IGNORED BY THE RICH.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;On an appointed Saturday all the sufferers arranged to meet for a general consultation in the local synagogue.  Once assembled there, for a long time they discussed their troubles and sought for some remedy.  No one could suggest any remedy.  At last it was decided that the local rich Hebrews had not done their duty and to make an appeal to them.  The rich ones refused to pay any attention to the deputation, and ordered them away.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The result of this cold-blooded repulsion was almost electrical on the crowd.  As one man they threw themselves into a street-riot.  Honor, honesty, safety, all were forgotten under the terrible pangs of hunger and the stinging realization of the heartlessness of their co-religionists.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The riot lasted for five hours and was aimed exclusively at the houses of the rich.  Windows and doors were broken in, all that could be was carried off, the rest destroyed.  Nothing that could possibly be made away with was left.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Meanwhile the police had taken the alarm, but could at first do nothing in the face of the immense crowd.  When, at last, help had arrived, the riot was nearly over.  The Chief of Police was then about to take extreme measures and vowed to bring all the offenders to justice. When, however, upon investigation, he learned all the particulars, and that three Hebrews had died that same day from hunger, he decided that no further action was advisable in the matter.  Not only that, but he himself started a subscription for the relief of the sufferers.</font><br />
