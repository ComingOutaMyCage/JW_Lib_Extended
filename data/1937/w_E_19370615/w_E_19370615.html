<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>OPPOSING GOD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;77te </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord.”—Prov. 15: 9. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">baht i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH’S adversary the Devil has employed and continues to employ every possible means in opposition to God. One of the most subtle means employed by the adversary, and which has accomplished the greatest injury to the people, is that of religion. Had the people been informed that religion is of the Devil, no doubt there would have been a far less number of religionists in the earth. The time has now come for them to be informed. God’s great opponent or adversary is the Devil, and it now dearly appears that the Devil for centuries has been using religion to oppose God and to injure humankind. For the benefit of the people of good will toward God, and who therefore sincerely desire peace, contentment, happiness and life, it now appears to be imperative that the wickedness of religion should be brought clearly before the minds of the people, that they may have full opportunity to safeguard themselves. The publication of the truth of and concerning religion will bring and is bringing upon Jehovah’s witnesses a great amount of persecution, because the adversary well knows that when the people have a dear understanding of what religion in fact is, the Devil’s opportunity to deceive the people will be far less than ever before. It also seems quite necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to fully inform themselves of and concerning the origin, the practice, and the effects upon the people, of religion, that they may be more fully equipped to proclaim the great name of Jehovah God throughout the land and to render aid to those who desire to serve God and Christ. For this reason </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> here again emphasizes that which is in opposition to God and which is wicked and an abomination unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The Almighty God brought the first world to an end by the great deluge, which destroyed all flesh upon the earth, including the offspring of the union of the “sons of God’’ with the “daughters of men’’. The only survivors were those in the ark. ‘ ‘ And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.” (2 Pet. 2:5) Those who</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">were destroyed were wicked and an abomination in the sight of Jehovah God. There were left on earth Noah and his three sons and four other persons of Noah’s family. The “sons of God” that married human wi\es were imprisoned by Satan, and the wicked angels that joined Satan originally in his rebellion were remanded to a degraded condition and habitation. The Devil had not been deprived of his power, and the reason will be seen as the progress is made in this study. Another world came into existence immediately following the flood, and that world persists to this day; and most persons believe that it will continue for ever, but in this they err. The world consists of heaven and earth, the heaven being that part which is invisible to human eyes, and the earth that part of the world which is visible to human eyes. Angels were not included in the judgment executed at the time of the flood, but the then existing relationship between the visible and invisible was destroyed by the flood. It is written that “by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth [the heavens] standing out of the water and [the earth] in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished”.—2 Pet. 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The world that is now, that is to say, the invisible and the visible, will that abide for ever ? The scripture answers that question in these words: “But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” (2 Pet. 3:7) The world now in existence is designated by the Lord as “this present evil world” (Gal. 1:4), and such is the one that he has decreed shall be destroyed .-.nd pass away. “Fire” is a symbol of complete de-st ruction, which will befall the present world. Satan the Devil is the prince or invisible ruler in control of the present wicked world, which shall pass away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2 Cor. 4:4) With its passing away there shall appear a new world, and concerning which the Scriptures say: “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwellcth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) Following the flood ITti</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">the population of the earth consisted of Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, and the other members of Noah’s household. “And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” (Gen. 9:1) “Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.” (Gen. 10:1) The human race then began to multiply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SANCTITY OF LIFE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Immediately after Noah left the ark Jehovah God made known his covenant concerning the sanctity of life. (Gen. 9:9-11) A covenant is a solemn and unbreakable declaration of God’s purpose. God would have all creation to know that life is a gift from him and that no one can properly take or destroy life without the permission of God. The beasts of the field and the fowls of the air God has provided for man that he may use them for food as he may require. (Gen. 9: 2-4) If any man, contrary to the law of God, kills another man, the killer is guilty of murder and must suffer death. (Gen. 9:6) Also the wanton and needless slaying of animals is a violation of God’s everlasting covenant. (Gen. 9:5) If a man kills beasts for his necessary food, such is lawful; but if he kills them merely to satisfy a selfish desire to slay or to gratify his desire for sport, that is a violation of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The covenant having been announced, the Devil saw an opportunity to further reproach the name of God by causing man to violate that everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life. This violation began to be manifested particularly in Nimrod. The man Nimrod was a descendant of Noah’s son Ham. “Nimrod . . . began to be a mighty [man] in the earth.” The word translated “mighty” in this text (Gen. 10:8) is the same word translated “mighty” relating to the offspring of the marriage of the spirit creatures with the daughters of men. (Gen. 6:4) “He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.” (Gen. 10:9) Nimrod was ambitious, warlike and bloodthirsty, and reveled in wicked dec Is, and was undoubtedly induced to do so by reason of the influence of the Devil and his associate demons. Nimrod hunted and killed wild beasts merely to satisfy his wicked desires, and he armed and trained young men to follow him in the killing business, and in the eyes of the people Nimrod became one greatly admired and worshiped because of his prowess. No doubt the Devil put that into the minds of the people, that they would show their devotion to a creature rather than to the Creator. It is written of Nimrod, that he was “a mighty hunter before [that is, superior to or greater than] ” the Almighty God. The honor, plaudits and adoration bestowed upon Nimrod was worship, and there began the practice of religion following the flood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Religion is a form of worship bestowed by creatures upon another, the one worshiped being regarded by such creatures as superior to themselves and worthy of adoration and worship. The Devil had gained control of the mind of Cush, the father of Nimrod, and had used Cush, the son of Ham, as a wrong leader in turning the increasing population away from Jehovah God. Nimrod, his son, together with others, was trained to violate God’s everlasting covenant and to establish creature worship, and this was for the purpose of diverting the minds of creatures away from the Almighty God. By this means Satan and his associate devils defied the Almighty God and reproached his name, and thereby set up the practice of religion in the earth. Let this be remembered and kept in mind henceforth: Religion has ever been the chief instrument employed by the Devil to reproach the name of Almighty God and turn the people away from the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Politics is the means and art of organizing and governing the people and to conduct and control organizations of men. Religion, having been organized and put into operation to turn the people away from God and to the worship of creatures, was quickly followed by politics, that is, an organization amongst men to control and rule the people. Nimrod, the religionist, took the lead in politics, he being made the ruler or king. “And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.” (Gen. 10:10) Nimrod and his religious and political associates built cities, into which the people were gathered, and that was the beginning of trade or commerce, trafficking amongst each other. From that day to this, religion, politics and commerce have been operated jointly by the Devil and his assistants for the purpose of controlling and ruling the nations of the earth and keeping them away from a knowledge and service of Almighty God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Further carrying out his wicked scheme to turn the people away from God and to cause them to worship creatures, the Devil and his wicked angels injected into the minds of men that their salvation depended upon the acts and power of themselves and other creatures. “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.”—Gen. 11: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>0</sup> By religion the Devil moved the people who were dwelling in the land of Shinar to build the tower of Babel, which means “the gate to God”; therefore a religion of the Devil was at that point brought forward to defy the Almighty God. Doubtless because of that organized movement in setting up a religion God interfered and brought about a confusion of the language of the people, and hence the Hebrew word for Babel means confusion. From the very beginning God expressed his indignation against religion, showing that it is an abomination in his sight because formulated, brought into existence and practiced by the Devil. Nothing has brought about so much confusion among the people as the many kinds of religions that are practiced among them. From and after the flood until now religion has been the chief means of confusing, deceiving and misleading the people and has resulted in turning them away from the knowledge of and worship of the true and almighty God. This of itself is proof conclusive that religion is the product of the Devil, employed specifically to deceive the people and to turn them away from Jehovah, Religion causes the people to be very superstitious and to yield to the influence of their religious leaders, and that opens clearly the way for politicians to gain control of and rule the people, and for the use of commerce or traffic by which the people are robbed of their just rights and earnings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Babel and Babylon mean the same thing. Babylon is the name of the Devil’s organization, which combines three elements, religion, politics and commerce, to control the peoples of the earth. Religion is employed for selfish gain to the Devil’s crowd, and therefore God said to the Devil: “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.”—Ezek. 28:16,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Satan’s ambitious and covetous desire to get gain for himself induced him to rebel against the Almighty God, and thereafter he has employed religion, politics and commerce to further feed his insatiable and covetous desire. In harmony with this it is written: “For the love of money is the root of all evil • which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” —1 Timothy 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> “Money,” as here used, means anything by which gain is measured. The evil is not in the circulating medium which is called “money”, but the wrong results from loving or desiring that which enables one to reap selfish gain. Many men who have at first had faith in Jehovah God, and who began to serve him, have been led to covetousness, and that unsatisfied desire for gain has brought about their complete downfall. Such was the course of Satan and has ever been that of those who serve him. Religion is used for that purpose, that is, that the Devil might gain the devotion of creatures to anything, particularly to himself, and thereby turn them away from God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Following the organization of Babylon other organized nations came into existence, to wit: Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece, Rome, and others. All of such great world powers and all subdivisions thereof, or nations which have formed and do form any part thereof, have had and practiced and do have and practice religion. Babylon is the mother of all religions, and the Devil is the-father thereof. All religions properly take the name of Babylon. The Devil is the great enemy or adversary of God, and his religion therefore is an enemy of the Almighty God. The Devil is man's worst enemy, and his religion is likewise a deadly enemy to man. The Devil’s organization is symbolized by an unchaste or impure woman, which is called Babylon. Therefore all religions are of Babylon, and particularly the leading religion known in the lands called “Christendom”. All the nations, kindreds and peoples on the earth since the flood have had and practiced, and do continue to have and practice, some form of religion, and each and every one has been made so to do by the wily influence of that wicked one, the Devil, and his associate wicked spirits. It is therefore written in the Bible of and concerning Babylon that ‘she has made all the nations drunk with the wine of her fornication’. (Rev. 14: 8) “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” (Rev. 17:5) All of which shows that religion is the instrument of the Devil employed to oppose, to defy, to mock and to reproach the Almighty God and to deceive men and turn them away from the true Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah. (For further consideration see the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font4"> chapter six.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> All religious organizations on the earth are formed and carried on by men who are subjected to wrongful influence and ruled by the great enemy Satan the Devil; and this is true whether any of them know it or not, because the Bible so states. What is here written or said is not an assault upon men. There would be no reason or excuse for that, and no good could be accomplished by holding up men to ridicule. The purpose is to set the facts plainly before the people that all sincere ones may see who constitute their real enemies. There are two great organizations in existence, to wit: the organization of the Almighty God, which is wholly righteous, pure and true; and the organization of the Devil, the mimic god, which is unholy, wicked and entirely false. The people of earth are subjected to one or the other of these two organizations. The Devil and his wicked angels and other supporters at all times fight against God to defame his name and to turn the people away from God and into destruction. That wicked organization is attempting to destroy everyone who is on the side of Jehovah God and who therefore tries to do right. The Lord Jesus Christ and his true followers are entirely on the side of Jehovah God, even as the prophets of old were on the side of and served Jehovah God. The faithful servant of the Lord God, speaking by inspiration and authority from the Most High, points out that there is a great warfare waged by those who are on the side of the Devil against those who are devoted to Jehovah God, and employs these words, to wit: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Eph. 6:12) It is therefore seen that Satan and his wicked associates, that joined him in the rebellion originally, constitute the powers, principalities and invisible rulers of this wicked world which operate in darkness as the enemies of man. Those in the organization of the Almighty God make war upon that devilish rule and power, and therefore must tell the truth concerning religion, which makes war upon it because religion is the chief instrument by which the people are deceived. In that warfare, however, the faithful servants of God do not use weapons to injure any human creatures in their bodies. The ‘weapons of their warfare’ are just one, and that one is the “sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God”. (Eph. 6:13,17) To those who are on the side of Jehovah, and who are serving him in this warfare, Jehovah says: ‘Ye are my witnesses to tell the people about my name and kingdom and purpose.’ (Isa. 43:10,12) Such witnesses of God are men, walking in the flesh, but using only the weapons of the truth with which Jehovah has armed them. “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh; (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds).”—2 Cor. 10:3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Let it be clearly understood, therefore, that the true servants of the Almighty God and followers of Christ Jesus have no fight to wage against any human creature, be that person Jew, Gentile, Catholic, Protestant or infidel. They have no disposition to do injury to any man, but to tell the truth for the good of those who want to know the right way. Men of all nations have fallen under the wily influence and power of Satan and his wicked angelic associates, but such men are the objects of compassion. It is the privilege and duty of Jehovah’s witnesses to tell them the truth as God has commanded, in order that those who are among them and who are of good will toward God may find the only place of security and safety from their enemies. The truth of God’s Word is therefore a warning given that those of good will may heed the warning and flee to the place of safety.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Abel, Enoch and Noah were faithful and true to Jehovah and maintained their integrity toward God. They were witnesses to the name of the Almiirhty. It was 350 years after the flood dried up that Noah died (Genesis 9:28,29), and during that time the descendants of Noah increased rapidly. Almost all the people had by that time fallen under the influence and control of Satan and the other devils. Two years after the death of Noah Abraham was born. Abraham was then residing in the land of Ur of the Chaldees. He loved and served the Almighty God. When he was 75 years old, at the command of Almighty God he moved into Canaan: “Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee; and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.”— Gen. 12:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> He went there to be a witness for Jehovah. Since the rebellion at Eden God has had some faithful witnesses on the earth, although very few in number, compared to earth’s population. God began to make known that no man would have his blessing unless that man had faith in God and obeyed his commandments, and so He began to preach or proclaim the gospel unto Abraham. “And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.”— Gal. 3: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Abraham was a preacher of the truth, and hence a witness for Jehovah God. In due time there was born to Abraham and his wife Sarah a son named Isaac. With Abraham and Isaac God began to reveal by means of prophetic pictures his purpose to send to the earth his own beloved Son, Jesus, who is the real heir of promise and he who would prove to be the faithful and true witness of Jehovah, and who would be offered up as a sacrifice to provide the price of redemption for man, to the end that those who would have faith in God and Christ Jesus might escape the wiles of the Devil and find everlasting life. (Gen. 22:1-18) God has developed and carried out his purpose according to his sovereign will, and his purpose is certain to be accomplished even as he has declared it. (Isa. 46:11) It will be observed from this point forward that at every stage of man’s history religion has been used to oppose God, and particularly to deceive mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The nation of Egypt was, in the days of Abraham, a powerful nation. That nation practiced the Devil religion the same as did the peoples of Babylon. Egypt was a great, commercial and military nation and was ruled by a king the title of whom was Pharaoh, meaning “Great House”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Jacob was a grandson of Abraham, a true servant of God, one of the faithful patriarchs; and under the command and direction of the Almighty God he moved with his descendants into Egypt and resided there for some years. God changed the name of Jacob to Israel, and thereafter the descendants of Jacob were known as Israelites or Hebrews. (Gen. 32:28; 40:15) The Egyptians, who practiced the Devil religion, in time, under the rule of a harsh Pharaoh, made the Hebrews their slaves and greatly oppressed them. (Ex. 1:11-14) Pharaoh, the ruler and official representative of the Devil on earth, ordered all the male children of the Hebrews to be killed. Moses was born, and his parents hid him, and the babe was found by the daughter of Pharaoh and was reared in the royal house.—Ex. 2: 6-10; Heb. 11: 23-28; Acts 7 : 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Because of his zeal for Jehovah and his people, Moses, when he grew to manhood’s estate, was compelled to flee from Egypt in order to remain faithful to God, and he went and dwelt in the land of Midian. While in that land God selected Moses and sent him into Egypt as the deliverer of his people. The Hebrews had refused to yield to the Devil religion practiced in Egypt, and held to the promise made to their father Abraham, and therefore the Egyptians, under the direction of the Devil and his angels, continued to increase the burden and oppression upon the Israelites. Their burdens grew in severity, and God heard their cries, and he sent Moses down to Egypt to act as their leader and deliverer from the hand of the oppressor. It was while in Midian, and when Moses was selected, that God revealed himself to Moses as the “I AM”, that is, the self-existing One, not the one who was or will be, but the One who is, I AM, without beginning and without end. He revealed himself to Moses by his name JEHOVAH, which means his purpose toward those who love and serve him. (Ex. 6: 3) When Moses appeared before Pharaoh he told him that Jehovah God had commanded that Pharaoh should let the Hebrews leave Egypt, and Pharaoh replied: “Who is [Jehovah], that I should obey his voice?” (Ex. 5:2) This is cited as a further proof that Pharaoh was the official representative of the Devil and the enemy of Jehovah God. Then followed the afflictions upon Egypt, which God sent in the way of plagues, that the Egyptians might be fully warned of his power and his purpose; and time and again, because of these plagues, Pharaoh agreed to let the people go, but refused when the time came for them to go. Then God sent the last plague, that is, the plague of the slaying of the firstborn of Egypt. When the firstborn died, then Pharaoh permitted the Israelites to leave Egypt. Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt and by God's grace took them dry-shod over the Red sea, and when Pharaoh’s army attempted to follow and to destroy the Hebrews they were drowned in the sea. (Ex. 14:21-31) Thus Jehovah God there made a prophetic picture foretelling his purpose in his own due time to completely overthrow the Devil and all of his forces. These historical truths are here recited in order that we may get a proper view of the operation of the enemy against the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BIBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> How may it be known for a certainty that what is recited in the foregoing is true and wholly trustworthy? The answer is, because those facts are recorded in the Bible, which is the Word of God, and which is the truth. (John 17:17) Did the people who lived on the earth prior to the time of Moses have the Bible? No; because Moses himself wrote the first five books of the Bible at the dictation of Jehovah God. Prior to that time God had communicated with his faithful men on earth by and through his angels. (Gen. 18:1-33; 19:1,15) God spoke to Moses and gave him instruction what he should do when he went into Egypt. God made a covenant with the Hebrews just before they left Egypt, and he used Moses as spokesman and mediator for that purpose. When the Hebrews or Israelites reached Mount Sinai after leaving Egypt, God there confirmed his covenant with them, giving to them his fundamental law. (Ex. 19:1-20) lie also delivered to them through Moses his divers statutes. God commanded Moses what to write, and he wrote as he was commanded, and thus came into existence the first five books of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The record of Jehovah shows that God created man in his own image and likeness and that he made the earth for the habitation of man (Isa. 45:12, 18) and that he instructed the first man what he should do in order to maintain his integrity and proper standing before the Lord. The Devil rebelled, together with a huidc of wicked angels, which crowd of wicked ones assaulted mankind to turn them away from God and to destroy them. It is only reasonable that God would give to the obedient men who had withstood the Devil his own word, that they might be guided in the right way. This he did by his angels or messengers for a time, and then in his own due time he caused his faithful servants to make and record his message to mankind, which is called the Bible, and which God has preserved since for the benefit of those who desire to know what is right. Moses was wholly devoted to the Lord God, and God chose him to write the books of the Bible that first appear. Thereafter other faithful servants of the Lord wrote portions of the Bible as God commanded them and dictated to them. One of those faithful servants wrote: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.” (2 Sam. 23:2) Further testimony upon this point is: ‘Holy men of God [men devoted to God] spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.’ (2 Pct. 1:21) (For a more detailed consideration of how we got and have the Bible, see  </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font4"> chapter 5.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Some men say: “I do not believe there is an Almighty God. and hence do not believe the Bible.” Such men cannot see and understand the truth and are wholly ignorant of man’s relationship to the Creator. The Devil has made men mentally blind, and this he has done lest the truth should shine into their minds. (2 Cor. 4:4) A sane and reasonable man, by merely looking about him and observing the things that exist, must know that there is a great Creator, who made all things that are visible, and that great Creator is revealed as the Almighty God. One who does not believe God could never understand the truth, but must remain in darkness. It is written: “But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.’’ (Heb. 11:6) The man who says there is no Creator is a fool. (Ps. 14:1) If a man puts himself in the fool class, that shows he is completely under the control of the Devil, who is his worst enemy. God does not force man to believe the truth. He puts the truth before man and permits man to exercise his own desire and to accept it or not. God is light, and he it is who ‘covers himself with light’. (Ps. 104:2) His light of truth is not given to those who serve the Devil; and that is shown by the fact that the wicked angels are restrained in darkness. “Light is sown for the righteous.’’ (Ps. 97:11) The man who delights himself in the law of God and strives to walk righteously is a man who walks in the light and is blessed.—Ps. 1:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2:</sup>' The Bible was not written for fools, nor is this publication for the benefit of fools. The Bible was written and given to man for his aid and guidance, that such man of good will and purpose might be fuiiy advised as to the right way to go and that he might stay on the side of God and refuse to serve the Devil. “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Tim. 3:16,17) This publication attempts to put the Bible in a simple way before the people who want to know the truth. It is not expected it will be appreciated or used by others. The Scriptures contain the Word of God, and the same is true and is the proper guide for the man who wants to know and to do what is right. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. Thy word is true from the beginning; and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. I hate and abhor lying; but thy law do I love.”—Ps. 119:105,160,162,163.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Jesus, the perfect One, testified concerning God’s Word as written in the Bible, and said: “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) Let no man conclude, however, that the mere possession of the Bible or an occasional reading over texts thereof is sufficient to enable him to be wise. Many persons say, “I have the Bible and know what it teaches”; and yet they are entirely ignorant of what it contains, and of the meaning thereof. The Bible is the greatest storehouse of knowledge and wisdom. A man who desires to know the truth must study the Bible, and thus study to show himself approved of God, and not be ashamed to acknowledge to all that all good things proceed from the Almighty God. (2 Tim. 2:15) A meek person is one who has an honest desire to learn; and if such a man applies himself in God’s appointed way he is certain to learn, as it is written: “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.”—Ps. 25: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Many religious clergymen deny the Bible. And why? Because they are not men of God, but are on the Devil’s side. All higher critics are in this class. Such men are wise in their own conceits and desire to shine in the eyes of other men and have the honor and praise which properly belongs to the Almighty God, and thus show themselves in the Devil’s company. They possess worldly wisdom, as it is written: “For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”—1 Cor. 1:19,20,25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The opinion of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> man is of no value whatsoever if that opinion expressed is contrary to the Word of God. If you follow the teachings of men you are certain to remain in darkness. All men are by nature imperfect, and men grow in knowledge and wisdom only when they seek to know and to do the will of God; and for that reason the man who denies the Bible as the inspired Word of God is a foolish person, whether that man be a clergyman or a hodcarrier. To trust in the opinion of man is folly, and leads to certain destruction. “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” (Ps. 146:3) But to learn of and trust in and follow God’s direction leads to life and happiness. “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3:5,6) “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) If a man desires to know the truth, then he must prove all things by the Word of God, which is true, and must hold fast that which is in harmony with the Word of God. All things else are on the side of man’s enemy.—1 Thess. 5:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The Devil is the prince of darkness, and he puts forth his best endeavors to keep the people in ignorance of the truth and therefore to hold them in darkness. Why do religious leaders, the clergymen, try to keep the people from studying and understanding the Bible? Why have they instructed the people of their congregations to refuse to read anything that explains the Bible? Why do they tell the people to destroy books that present only the Bible view? The answer is, because they are the agents of and representatives of the Devil, whether they are aware of that fact or not, because he who is not for the Lord is against him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">(Matt. 12:30) For selfish reasons they desire to keep the people in ignorance so that the clergy may hold the people in subjection to themselves, receive the honor and plaudits of the people, and also the financial support that comes by reason of the influence they have over the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY THE DEVIL LIVES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> In that long period of time from Eden to Mount Sinai, when the Israelites gathered there at God’s command, the Devil and his angels opposed God, and oppressed and afflicted all men who had tried to do right and serve God, and the Devil had succeeded in turning most of the human race away from God. Even Mises and Aaron found themselves in a jam because of the influence exercised over the people by Satan and his angels. The Devil had inflicted great punishment upon the Israelites when in Egypt, and now God had delivered them and they stood at the foot of Mount Sinai to receive the law from God’s hand, that they might be shielded from the Devil’s attack. While Moses was in the mountain receiving the law at the hands of God, the Devil overreached the Israelites and caused them to turn to idolatry or religious worship. Many have asked, and still ask, Why did not God kill the Devil then or before that time and spare men from his oppressive hand and his wicked deception! The Devil and his wicked angels continue to operate even to this very day, filling the earth with violence, and the people with dread. Why does the just and loving God permit the Devil to remain alive and carry on his wickedness!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> The answer is given in brief at this point, and then the proof will follow, to wit: Because the Devil declared his ability to turn all men away from God, and he challenged God to put a man on the earth who would remain true and faithful to Jehovah when put to the test by the Devil. That challenge put at issue the righteous name and word of the Almighty God. The effect of the challenge was to declare that Jehovah God is not supreme, he is not all-powerful. God could have killed the Devil immediately. But suppose he had killed him and his wicked angels at the time of the rebellion or at the time of the flood, and before the Devil had been given a chance to oppress the Israelites, what would have been the result! It could have been easily said then that the Devil had not been given the opportunity to prove who is supreme. The question of supremacy would not have been settled in the minds of other creatures. If one creature could defeat God, then the foundation for faith and obedience in God would be for ever shaken. The Lord God would give the Devil a full opportunity to prove his challenge before settling the question for ever. Pharaoh was the Devil’s representative in Egypt and had defied Jehovah by raising the question: “Who is [Jehovah], that I should obey his voice! ’ ’ The Devil himself had openly defied Jehovah God. Then God caused Moses to write down in His sacred Book the reason why Jehovah God permitted the Devil and his angels to carry on their wickedness and why He has not yet destroyed them, and that declaration, which is an answer to the foregoing question, is this: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font4"> The declaration applied to the Devil specifically and to his then representative on the earth, Pharaoh, the ruler of the chief world power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Stated in common phrase, the Almighty God declared he would permit Satan and his associated devils to have all the rope possible and a free hand to put forth their very strenuous efforts against Him; that in his own due time he would show his adversaries his supreme power by destroying them and all their supporters and their works of wickedness; that before destroying them he would cause his own name and his supremacy to be declared throughout the earth, to the end that the enemies might have full warning and notice of their coming destruction, and that the people of good will toward God might be warned and flee from Satan, and take their stand on the side of Jehovah God, and find protection and security. That question at issue must be fully and completely determined for ever in favor of Jehovah God in order that his name and word be vindicated. Such is the reason why God permitted the wicked ones to continue in the earth, and he gives his sure word that in due time he will completely destroy all of them. Now the time has come for his name to be declared throughout all the earth, and for that reason these great truths are now being brought to the attention of the people, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> But why has God permitted the Devil to oppress and afflict those persons on earth who have agreed to serve him! Why has he not safeguarded these faithful ones from all assaults of the Devil! The answer is that if God should do so, then the Devil would not have a free hand in his effort to prove his wicked challenge; and, furthermore, those who have agreed to serve God could prove their integrity and faithfulness to God only by resisting the assaults of the Devil, and under all conditions of persecution continuing to maintain their integrity toward God. For that reason God has repeatedly stated to those who serve him his promise to preserve them and give them everlasting life and that he will destroy all the wicked: ‘ ‘ The Lord preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy. ” (Ps. 145: 20) *‘Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”— Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JOB AN ENSAMPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>84</sup> The Scriptures specifically name some men who were faithful and true to Jehovah and who withstood the Devil. These men named include Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Job and Moses. God used faithful men in times of old as cnsamples or types of greater things to come to pass. Among those who were so used was Job. The place of habitation of the Devil and his angels was and is, according to the Scriptures, in “the land of Magog”. (Ezck. 38:2) In the days of Job Satan had not been barred from heaven, but had the privilege of appearing from time to time before the Almighty God. It appears that from time to time the faithful sons of God presented themselves before Jehovah: ‘‘Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.”—Job 2:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> To be sure, Jehovah knew from whence Satan came, but he held communication with Satan manifestly for the purpose of making a picture foretelling how faithful men are tried and tested by the Devil: ‘‘And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comcst thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fcarcth God, and escheweth evil? and still he hoi doth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils, from the sole of his foot unto his crown.”—Job 2:2-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> Doubtless Satan taunted Jehovah by calling his attention to the fact that only a few men since the time of the flood had stood by Jehovah, that most of them had gone with the Devil, and if the Devil had a ehancc he could make them all forsake God. That was a defiant challenge to Jehovah God, and he accepted the challenge. Job was rich in earthly goods and surrounded by a happy family and enjoyed good health, peace and quietness. The Devil declared that if those things were taken away from him he would curse God to his face. In answer to that challenge Jehovah said: ‘‘Behold, he is in thy hand,” that is, ‘you are at liberty to make him curse me if you can.’ Thereafter Satan the Devil afflicted Job with a loathsome disease, from which he suffered so .terribly that his own wife said to him: ‘‘Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.” (Job 2: 9) But Job stood firm amidst all this test and maintained his integrity toward God. Then the Devil further afflicted Job by causing certain pious-faced religionists to torment him. and through it all Job maintained his integrity, remained firm and true to the Most High. That which is recorded concerning the experiences of Job is an example of those who endure suffering for righteousness’ sake and who in the face of all manner of persecution and punishment maintain their integrity toward God. Just why God would permit the Devil to proceed with a free hand in opposition to him and in persecution of those who serve God was not revealed at the time to anyone, not even to the angels. That God had a fixed time in which to make known the reason is certain, however, and exactly on time God will bring the entire issue to a climax to his own glory. What followed shows that he has permitted the Devil to tempt men for centuries, and particularly through the operation of religion, using it as an instrument to carry out his wicked challenge. The day of reckoning is at hand, when the issue must be settled, and therefore it is God’s due time to make known the reason to all those who are diligent to have a proper understanding.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL ORGANIZED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> The descendants of Jacob, now called Israel, were organized into a nation and put under the leadership of Moses. It was after the Israelites had been miraculously delivered from Egypt, and while they were encamped at the base of Mount Sinai, that God gave to that people his fundamental law and his statutes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ten</span><span class="font4"> is a symbolic number denoting completeness, and what is generally called ‘‘the ten commandments” really means all or the complete statement of God's fundamental law to man. His ‘‘statutes” specifically define man’s duty to be performed in harmony with the fundamental law. The nation of Israel was in direct contrast to all other nations and peoples because Israel was the people chosen by the Lord God for himself, and by and through which people he would and did make prophetic pictures foreshadowing greater things to come to pass in the future. (1 Cor. 10:11) Note here how God gave to that people the fundamental law, which fundamental law applies to all people who undertake to do the will of God: ‘‘In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: Ye have scon what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people; for all the earth is mine. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. And Moses came, and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him. And all the people answered together,, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord.”— Ex. 19:1-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Jehovah God communicated to Moses his law, which was written upon tables of stone: “And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.” (Ex. 31:18) The unlimited power of the Almighty God enables him to write upon stone as well as upon the sand. Every person who believes that the Almighty God exists, and that he is the rewarder of them that serve him, can really see how God made provision for the Bible to be written and kept securely through all the centuries. No one has ever been able to destroy the Bible, although repeated attempts have been made to do so. It is certain that the Devil has made every possible effort to destroy the Bible, and in modern times particularly he has used religionists, who are called “higher critics”, to discredit the Bible and cause the people to refuse to believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REASON FOR THE LAW</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> If every creature were perfect and obedient to Jehovah God there would be no need for a written law prescribing what is right and commanding the people to refrain from what is wrong. Perfect creatures are moved by unselfishness to do that which is right. The human race was imperfect from the time of the expulsion of Adam from Eden, and by the time the Israelites were delivered from Egypt mankind was much depraved because of his fall and the continued influence exercised upon man by Satan. Laws are necessary for imperfect men to have as a sure guide, that they may go the right way. The laws are made for just such, as it is written: “Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the -lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers.” —1 Tim. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> Love, which is the perfect expression of unselfishness, is the complete fulfillment of the law, therefore making the enforcement of law unnecessary. (Rom. 13:10) The very essence of the law is written in the heart of every creature that is in full harmony with God and delights to do his will. At the time the Israelites were assembled at Mount Sinai the Devil had almost all of the people on earth in his service, and therefore all were in the way of destruction. The Israelites God would safeguard from that destructive influence. The law which God gave to the Israelites was not for God’s benefit, but entirely for the benefit of man. If a man walks with the Devil he is certain to die, but if he maintains his integrity toward God he will live. Therefore God gave his law through Moses to the Israelites and which applies to all who want to do right, and the first in order and first in importance of his commandments or fundamental law is this, to wit: “And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. ’ ’—Ex. 20:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The law of God never changes, because God never changes. (Mal. 3:6) His law points out the way to everlasting life. No creature will ever be given life everlasting who willfully, that is, intentionally, violates God’s law. If a man chooses another for his god, Jehovah will not grant to that man life. For a man to violate the fundamental law of God means that that man puts himself on the side of the Devil and therefore leads him to destruction. For the benefit of man, then, God provided in his law that man should have no other god before him, because God alone is the source of life. Religion has been and is the most effective means to induce the violation of God’s law.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>VIS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH GOD is the everlasting King, and therefore the Ruler without end. “ [Jehovah] is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.” (Jer. 10:.10) He is the Eternal God of order and therefore has had an organization for ever, which, for want of a better term, we call his universal organization. From his Word he makes it clear that his purpose is to have an organization “cut out without hands” (or taken) from his organization universal, and then made the capital over his entire organization. (Dan. 2:34) That capital organization is otherwise designated in his Word the ‘reigning’ or ‘royal’ house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan, the opposer of Jehovah, has builded his own house or organization and made himself the head thereof, and which organization is-desperately wicked. -It consists of both invisible and visible parts, hence called ‘heaven and earth’. Satan and his wicked angels constitute the invisible part, while the nations of the earth ruled by wicked men constitute the visible part of his organization. Against Satan’s entire organization Jehovah will express his wrath, and no part of that wicked organization shall be able to abide the Almighty’s wrath, as stated by his prophet Jeremiah. Jehovah did not hinder Satan in the building of his wicked organization, but for many centuries he has permitted Satan and his organization to remain in existence, and until God’s due time to make manifest-his own supreme power and to make for himself an everlasting name.—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Jehovah’s due time Satan’s folly will be made to appear to all creation. Soon Jehovah will use his mighty “Stone” that he has ‘cut out of his mountain (universal organization) without hands’ to break in pieces Satan’s organization and to drive it away as chaff is driven before the wind. (Dan. 2:45) That</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">mighty Stone of Jehovah is the Chief Corner Stone of Zion, to wit, Christ Jesus. Jehovah having permitted Satan to persecute to the limit his mighty “Stone”, then God exalted him and gave him a name above every name and has commanded that all creation shall bow-before him.—Phil. 2: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah builds his royal house for his own habitation, or meeting place between himself and his obedient creatures. The members of that royal house arc limited in number, and every one must be an overcomer. Christ Jesus, the Head of that royal house, overcame the enemy, and every member thereof must do likewise. ‘ ‘ In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.” (John 16: 33) “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go no more out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new name. ’ ’—Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy and his organization will make a -last and desperate stand against -the organization of Jehovah, and will fail. “These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they also shall overcome that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.” (Rev. 17:14, R.F.) It is to be expected that this, the most important part of God’s great organization, would be given much attention in his Word; and so it is. Long ago Jehovah caused many pictures and types concerning it to be made, and all these things were written down for the aid and comfort of the remnant now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In making-the pictures pointing to his royal house the nation of Israel was used by Jehovah, and he also used Nebuchadnezzar as an instrument to destroy that typical nation because of its falling away from the covenant with God and joinin&quot; the forces of the enemy. It was in the year 617 B.C. that God permitted Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to carry away many Jews into captivity, and among them was his prophet Ezekiel. Five years thereafter, to wit, in 612 B.C., Jehovah gave Ezekiel a vision of His own great organization and caused him to begin a prophecy concerning the same. Six years later, or, to wit, 606 B.C., Jerusalem was broken up and the temple which Solomon had built was burned. Thereafter, to wit, in the year 592 B.C., Ezekiel was given a vision and caused to write down the prophecy concerning the true temple or royal house of Jehovah. The prophet Ezekiel was then about fifty years of age and in captivity with other Jews in Babylon. It was about fifty-six years later, or, to wit, 536 B.C., that the work of rebuilding the temple was begun by Zerubbabel. That work was delayed for sixteen years, and finally v,as completed about 515 B.C. Approximately seventy-seven years elapsed from the date of Ezekiel’s vision and prophecy concerning the temple until the building of the temple at Jerusalem by Zerubbabel was completed, and which temple was later destroyed. The prophecy of Ezekiel concerning the temple therefore deals with that which is of far greater importance than any building ever erected by human power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fortieth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy begins with these words: “In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me thither.’’ Only one prophecy was delivered by Ezekiel after the prophecy dealing with the royal house. That later prophecy is recorded in Ezekiel 29:17 and was. in the twentyseventh year of the captivity, and which later prophecy disclosed what Jehovah, by his great Executive Officer, will.do to Egypt, which pictures Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah had caused his prophet Malachi to foretell a work to be done by his Messenger, Christ Jesus, and which is called ‘preparing the way before the Lord’, and that then straightway that Messenger, Christ Jesus, would come to his temple. (Mal. 3:1) Now it appears from the Scriptures, and supported by the facts as set forth in chapter eleven of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font4">Book Three, that Christ Jesus, the Messenger of Jehovah, came to his temple in the year 1918 but that the true followers of Christ Jesus on earth did not discern that fact until the year 1922. It was then and thereafter that the true people of God learned that Christ Jesus had come to his temple for the purpose of judgment and to do a purifying work which would cleanse and purify Jehovah’s sanctuary class. This cleansing work must be done, and the truth of and concerning the Lord’s coming be made clear to them, before the true sons of Levi could offer an offering of righteousness before the Lord. (Mal. 3:2,3) It therefore appears that the cleansing work of the “sons of Levi” class was not done until 1922. Hence that year 1922 was the earliest possible date that the class whom Ezekiel foreshadowed could begin to perceive the fulfillment of Ezekiel’s vision of the temple. Although an effort had been made in 1917 to give an explanation of the temple that Ezekiel saw, it was then impossible for any creature on earth to understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The vision was given to Ezekiel in the beginning of the year, which was the month of Nisan, the beginning of the year according to God’s commandment. (Ex. 12:2) Mark that it was on the tenth day of the month, the very day for the selecting of the paschal lamb. (Ex. 12:3) This was the same day of the year on which Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was offered as King to the Jews, the which was the laying of THE STONE in miniature, which Stone, the King, was rejected by the Israelites. (Matt. 21: 42) It was also the very day of the year when Jesus went into the temple at Jerusalem and cleared out the mercantile clement and said to them that used the house of the Lord for personal gain: “Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.” (John 2:16) “And [he] said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.”—Matt. 21:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jerusalem foreshadowed “Christendom”, which was smitten because of the “war in heaven”, which began in 1914. It was fourteen years after the beginning of that war, to wit, 1928, when Jehovah gave his covenant people on earth the first understanding of the meaning of his organization, as pictured in the first chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy, and which truth was first declared at the Detroit convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1928. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> 1928, page 263.) The war, by which “Christendom” was smitten, ended about 1918, and fourteen years thereafter, to wit, in 1932, God permitted the publication of the meaning of Ezekiel’s vision concerning the temple. The facts show that it was fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem before Ezekiel got his temple vision about which he prophesied. God’s people, whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, therefore could not expect to get a full understanding until God’s due time, and they could not expect to get an understanding of all of his truth at one time. When that understanding is given to them they know that it comes from the Lord, and not from man. Ezekiel did not choose his particular day to prophesy. He was in the hand of the Lord, who arranged the matter and who put his spirit upon Ezekiel. Likewise the remnant do not choose the time to understand God’s Word and to proclaim it. “This is the day which the Lord hath made.” (Ps. 118:24) This is the day chosen by the Lord in which “young men . . . see visions” and discern the fulfillment of this grand vision which was given to Ezekiel. The power of the Lord is upon his “faithful servant” class, and for this reason they are permitted to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah used Ezekiel to declare the prophecy which is now in course of fulfillment in the last days. What Ezekiel saw was only a vision, and hence was not a type, but a prophecy; therefore we need not look here for type and antitype, but look for a prophecy and the fulfillment thereof. “In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me [down] upon a very high mountain, by which was as [ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R-V.)</span><span class="font4"> whereon was as it were] the frame of a city on the south.’’ (Ezek. 40:2) At that time Ezekiel was in captivity, and the land of Israel was desolate, and it continued so until the end of the seventy-year period. What Ezekiel saw was “the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people’’. (Ezek. 38: 8) The vision had by Ezekiel shows him ‘set down in the land ’; and this was a prophecy that in God’s due time his devoted people would be restored from Babylon (Satan’s organization) and brought into Zion (God’s organization) as a delivered people, and that they would thereafter worship and serve God as a separate and peculiar people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ezekiel states that he beheld himself set down upon a very high mountain. That was symbolic of Mount Zion, “the mountain of the Lord’s house’’ (Isa. 2:2,3), that is to say, God’s organization. It is the place where the hundred and forty-four thousand take up their position with Christ Jesus. (Rev. 14:1) It was like the vision had by John, who from the top of a “great and high mountain’’ witnessed the descending of the great and holy Jerusalem. (Rev. 21: 9,10) Upon the top of this mountain is God's temple or royal house built. “This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.' ’—Ezek. 43:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In vision Ezekiel beheld the temple as in “the holy portion of the land” on the north, and the city was “on the south”. (Ezek. 45:1-6; 48:15-30) The name of the city is Jehovah-Shammah. Both the city and the temple are situated upon the mountain. The vision shows that it could not refer to a literal mountain in Palestine, and therefore that the prophecy would not be literally fulfilled in the land of Palestine. The Scriptures do not warrant the conclusion that the literal temple, of which Ezekiel had a vision, will ever be built in the land of Palestine. The vision, being a prophecy, foretells the greater temple and city built by divine power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ezekiel describes his position as ‘on a very high mountain’ where the hand of Jehovah had brought him. During the World War Jehovah preserved his faithful ones from the violence of Satan’s organization, and afterwards these were brought into his organization and given much to do. That was a partial vindication of his name and was foreshadowed by the bringing of Ezekiel to the very high mountain in the vision which he had. God’s promise is to bring the remnant through the battle at Armageddon and to preserve them, which will be a further vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From his vantage point on the mountain Ezekiel beholds a man. “And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate [of the temple].” (Ezek. 40: 3) The man had the appearance of copper (mistranslated in the text “brass”). Copper is one of the noble metals mentioned in the Scriptures. The appearance of this man as of copper would indicate that he was not a mere human creature, but was one of God’s heavenly deputies sent to perform some important duty. If the creature that Ezekiel saw had been a mere human it would not have been necessary to say that he had the appearance of copper. The metallic appearance is designed to show superiority to human creatures. In the vision that John was given on the isle of Patmos he describes Jesus Christ as a man; “and his feet like unto fine brass [copper], as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. ’ ’—Rev. 1:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The man whom Ezekiel saw had a “line of flax” in his hand, and also “a measuring reed”. Flax (that is, linen) denotes righteousness and symbolically says that the man was there to measure in righteousness. He was equipped to measure volume or depth, and perpendicularity and straightness, as well as height and length. The man was standing at the gate with the measuring equipment; which symbolically says that ‘judgment is about to begin at the house of God’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">John, whom the angel of the Lord caused to write down The Revelation, corresponds to Ezekiel, and he wrote: “And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.” (Rev. 11:1) The Lord had caused the apostle to write: “Judgment must begin at the house of God.” (1 Pet. 4:17) It is also written: “Judgment also will I lay to the line.” (Isa. 28:17) The flax line and the reed symbolize the revealed purposes of Jehovah, that is to say, the more accurate understanding of them whereby God’s covenant people may measure themselves individually. They do not measure themselves by themselves, but the measuring must be done according to the standard of the Lord, and these measuring instruments are in the hand of the heavensent Messenger. “For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.”—2 Cor. 10:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The man whom Ezekiel saw was standing at the entrance of Jehovah's building. His position there would be an invitation to Ezekiel to approach and to enter the temple, which, to be sure, must be done according to the divine rules. The class whom Ezekiel foreshadowed must be brought into the holy structure of God in his due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Experience bears out the effectiveness of the phonograph in the witness work. Also, it demonstrates that much needs to be done in working out a smoother introduction of the phonograph to gain admittance to more of the homes called upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unable to place literature to amount to anything with the poverty-stricken people of a little fishing settlement, the phonograph used in the open, yards and on the street, attracted a good crowd who got some of the message in that manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In making a delivery of an -Italian book to a man who did not speak or undeistand English, his English-speaking family were gathered from all pints of the house by running the phonograph lectures. These other persons would not have been reached on that visit without the phonograph message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One Sunday over five hours were well spent in two low-class rooming houses of fifteen rooms each. Though many of the rooms were not occupied at the time, the phonograph was used eleven times, twenty-seven persons listening, and in addition to the literature placed that day by aid of the phonograph, several phonograph meetings were arranged for back-call, and several books and a Bible delivered. The phonograph was introduced by means of the radio slip, the questions gaining the interest of the people; and the slip also explains the “special service” of the lectures in their homes. The testimony card was used, generally following the lecture in introducing the literature. It is quite certain that these people would not all have been reached without the phonograph. The placements of literature were not unusually large, but what was done was primarily because of the phonograph; and what is more impoitant, the kingdom message was placed before these people clearly. They had not been reached before, though that territory is ‘ ‘ gone over ’ ’ very frequently. Many of them are hard and tough and would not come to the door and read a card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another instance: A man asked for the publisher to return later with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> as he had ‘ ‘ no money ’ ’ at the first call. When the deliveiy was made he still could not “buy anything”, but a record was run for him and Ins wife, a Bible discussion was started, with several records used, and he not only took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font3">but ordered a Bible and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prepaiation</span><span class="font3"> for later delivery. Another man said, “Before you start that record, let me tell you I have no money and cannot take a thing.” During the running of “Kingdom” he said, “Docs that book tell about what he is saying?” And after the little lecture was done he took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font3">making the contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Any number of instances can be mentioned. It seems, however, that even more important than the results manifested in placements of literature and people accepting the truth, is the fact that the phonograph is such an effective instrument in placing the kingdom message before the people in a way they can understand it; which, after all, is our job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Received in good condition the eighteen (18) discs, for which 1 thank Jehovah; for the phonograph is proving for one who is deaf a wonderful aid to witnessing. On Thursday (3-11-37) the Queens unit loaned the disc (No. 101-102) to mo. The following day I went into a shoe store. Lady there informed me that she had read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> book. I offered to play a record. She consented, and I ran “Value of Knowledge”. She listened very attentively and then turned the record over for me to run “Riches”. As a result of this I placed the full set of fifteen (15) bound books. In placing the set, though, I took a pair of shoes for the set. A few weeks ago I met a colored lady on a Sunday; I ran two records. I found she had five books. A week later I delivered four more bound books, and then ran four records. Tonight I delivered the balance of the set (seven bound books). She now lias all sixteen books. I ran the new records on my third trip there, and she enjoyed every one she has heard. Thinks they are fine. I sec now (after all the wonderful experiences 1 am having) that I made a big mistake in not witnessing with the phonograph sooner. A number of the big placements I have made of late (and some of the smaller placements also) I never would have made had it not been for the phonograph. The phonograph is certainly proving the most effective weapon ag-.inst Satan and his organization. One reason why 1 had hesi.ated to use the phonograph was my deafness; thought too many would be asking me if I was really deaf, ete. But, instead, I have very little questioning along that hue; Jehovah has taken care of that. Another thing I am thankful for is the testimony cards in so many different languages.. I always carry all the different cards, and as I meet one of a foreign language I question him and then hand him that card in his own language. Result of this has been speedier placements and a better understanding. Now I am never without the phonograph or all testimony cards in all languages. This makes it more effective to 'preach to all nations'.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We all were very much pleased when informed that you had consented to come to Oakland for the convention and for us; and glad to see you again. 1 hope that you are well in health, also rested from the joyful sen ice that you gave each day of the convention for our benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Armageddon seems to be nearer each day. Everything in the world is out of the normal condition that we have depended upon, especially in our own land, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today a sister and I found three homes where they were all well pleased to hear ‘‘ The Great Multitude ’ ’ by the phonograph. One lady said she believed the Bible the same way, about the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We need you, Brother Rutherford, because you are strong in faith; and there is great trouble upon the people. God has graciously promised to protect all who are faithfully keeping His commandments, and obedient in the service for the people, that they may have life according to Jehovah God’s will.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 must thank you for so much consolation in reading from your pen, and for your kindness many times much appreciated, when there seemed no helper near.

<p><span class="font3">I just can’t help taking a few minutes of your time to relate to you one of the many marvelous experiences with the new provision which the Lord has provided to us: the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A lady called upon me at the place where I was working and asked me, “Are you the gentleman that preaches the gospel with a phonograph?” I presume that she had heard of the progress of this startling news through the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Arrangements were made to have the phonograph at her home, and having heard a record, she stated, “I received more information from this record, which is only four minutes and a half, than from my husband, who has been a minister for many years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, she invited me to have a meeting in their church. She also stated that she would give an early notice to the congregation so all would be there to attend this ‘good meeting’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My experiences, by the Lord’s grace, are so numerous that I cannot write of them all. Not only do the people of good will receive blessings from Jehovah through the phonograph, but it also gives me strength, courage and power to help press the battle to the gate. As I see, this is the best method to ‘bruise the head of the serpent’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here arc some of the results of my latest meetings: In two back calls there was placed a total sum of thirty-five books and several booklets, together with a new subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3"> On another occasion, when I played the record entitled “Jehovah’s Organization’’ and “Satan’s Organization’’, I easily placed the three books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> and the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lliehcs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the newly interested have carried the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Protection </span><span class="font3">booklet to the place of their employment and have called it to the attention of their fellow workers. In quite a few cases they have arranged among themselves a phonograph meeting and have called me at some special time when they could gather as many to attend as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I wish every faithful brother on earth would carry in his hands from house to house this marvelous instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the Lord bless you continually to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fellow servant in the kingdom of Jehovah,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LORD’S BLESSING ON USE OF SOUND CAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I cannot refrain from telling you about the manifest blessing the Lord is giving us with the use of our sound equipment. As you know, we are now able to make our own vernacular records. I applied to the police for permission to use the sound car in some of the city streets of the native sections of Bombay. Permission was granted, but a C.I.D. official was sent to see what we were up to. This morning was the second of the series of meetings, and when the advertised time was up this C.I.D. official came up to me and asked if I minded staying a little over the time, as the people wanted to hear another lecture in Concani. lie also assisted us in suggesting fresh pitches for future meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We gave lectures in Hindi, Marathi, Concani and English and had an audience estimated at at least 500 people dunng two hours’ work. Three native brethren worked the surrounding houses and placed a substantial amount of literature. Having the lectures in the Indian vernaculars is proving a wonderful help in giving the witness. We are greatly encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With love and best wishes, I remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GREATEST PRIVILEGE TO SERVE CREATOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is to express my sincere appreciation for all your beautiful and wonderful books, including the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazines, and I Ariz sure you will accept it. To be in the Truth is a blessing in itself, and it is a creature’s greatest privilege to serve his or her Creator. I have not read all the books; but the ones I have read I’ve thoioughly enjoyed, particularly Riches, which I Ariz reading now. Your books are straight to the point, and exclude all sly ‘ ‘ twists ’ ’ and confusion; and besides, they are based exclusively on the Holy Bible, the invaluable Word of </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I feel very sad to know how Jehovah’s witnesses suffer innocently, and I Ariz sure these persecutors, paiticularly the Hierarchy-, shall pay bitterly-, with her friends Satan, Hitler, Mussolini and the company of “clever” politicians. In India the Kingdom work is poor; but I Ariz sure we could put up a remarkable record if only we had a few more witnesses, particularly those who know the vernacular. I know sufficient Hindustani, ns the “lingua franca” of India is called; and I will do my best, I promise, to the effect of proclaiming the Truth or Kingdom message to the ignorant people here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I Ariz eighteen years old, and thank God I’ve found the Truth when young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours, for ever, faithfully in Jehovah and Christ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">L. K. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scott, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK OF THE KINGDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We desire to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of your services in behalf of your brethren; to expiess our thankfulness for the spiritual food supplied by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and other publications and to express our sincere desire to carry on in our lespective districts in the work of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As we carry out instructions to “rise against her in battle” we pray the Lord’s blessing upon you as you continue to supply instructions and encouragement to your brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With Christian love, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren in assembly at</span></p>
