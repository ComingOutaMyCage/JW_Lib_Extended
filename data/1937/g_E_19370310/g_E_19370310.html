<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Hierarchy Wins “Peace and Safety” in Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE Roman Hierarchy has won such a complete victory in Germany that everybody in the country is virtually compelled to vote for Hitler or lose his means of making a livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only is it generally true that “once a Catholic, always a Catholic”, but the Hierarchy is more and more openly backing the German dictator and he is more and more yielding to the voice of Rome.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370310_files/g_E_19370310-2.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:291pt;">
<p><span class="font8">“They give gifts to all whores; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee; therefore thou art contrary.’’— Ezekiel 16: 33,34.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">At the last election all industrial leaders in the country received orders from the Nazis (Hitler’s party of Catholic Action) to discharge all who refused to go to the polls. In case they went and voted blank ballots, the blanks were counted as being for Hitler. At that election Catholic churches throughout Germany were ordered to have their congregations vote for Hitler. The methods of dominating actual or ostensible republics is now so well understood by the Hierarchy that out of 44,954,937 ballots cast, 44,411,911 were for Hitler. That is 98.8 percent, and fairly represents the grip that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has on </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany </span><span class="font10">at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Immediately after the election there began to be hints that Hitler was no longer anxious to have it appear that there is discord between himself and the Roman curia at Vatican City. It will be recalled that before that time there had been numerous arrests of prelates and others for smuggling funds out of the country. Note now the following from the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> of December 1, 1936:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. Wilhelm Soppa, Vicar General of the Diocese of Meissen, who was sent to the penitentiary last year charged with exchange violations for his diocese, has been released after serving only a quarter of his four-year term. The Bishop of Meissen’s brother, Dr. Theodore Legge, sentenced to three years in the penitentiary, also was released. A number of Rhineland monks and nuns imprisoned on like charges were also released.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Vice Trials Dropped</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">As early as April 8, 1936, it was announced in Bremen that all lawsuits in the province of Baden, with the exception of criminal suits, had been dropped, and in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Weser-Zeitung </span><span class="font10">the Minister of Education advanced the hope and expectation that the clergy would appreciate this friendly move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To get the Hierarchy at a political disadvantage the German government instituted suits against 200 Franciscan friars from the Rhineland and Westphalia for immoral offenses against male minors entrusted to their care;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">61 more fled to The Netherlands to escape trial. The cabled account stated that these unprintable offenses between the gowned and “Reverend” hypocrites and their pupils were maintained in every settlement maintained by the two orders in the Rhineland and Westphalia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A dispatch from Vatican City, published in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune,</span><span class="font10"> stated that Mussolini had intervened with the Vatican and that the vice trials would be dropped. This was not unlikely. Mussolini, once referring to the pope as “the bloody old wolf of the Vatican”, is now, for policy’s sake, an apparently ardent Roman Catholic, wearing beads, crosses and other junk. He is also obligated to the Vatican for assistance financially in the Ethiopian campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While Hitler’s announced plans against the sex perverts was under way the Hierarchy was on a hot spot. They tried to claim that to get their evidence against the Franciscans the Nazis had planted prostitutes in the monasteries; but that did not explain the flight of 61 of the accused friars to other lands, nor account for the plea of guilty, with a penalty of eight years in prison, for the very first friar placed on trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the headlines, as published in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> give an idea of the conditions actually existing in these hellholes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Priest Sentenced to 8 Years in Reich; Also Deprived of Civil Rights for Five Years on Charges of 45 Moral Offenses. Friar Gets a Long Term. Two Former Leaders of Young Catholic Organization Are Found Guilty by Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Reich Sentences More Catholics. Ratibor Priest Gets 15 Months on Charge Involving Girl, 15, Whose Confessor He Was. Coblenz Trial Continues. Ex-Francis-can Friar Jailed for 3 Years After Conviction in 16 Cases of Immorality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The evidence in these cases showed that even when the conditions in the monastery were twice reported to the bishop of Trier he did nothing to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the time the excitement was on the Nazi papers demanded the end of this imaginary celibacy between priests, monks and nuns, and some of the statisticians figured out how many more soldiers could be produced if all were married (and the quick-lime pits for infants abolished).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At length Hitler, as a “Practical Catholic”, ordered all prosecution of the monks and nuns for their disgraceful and immoral practices to cease. The German bishops then came out with a statement that the Franciscans who had been on trial for immoral conduct at Coblenz were laymen, and not priests. Had they desired to do so, they could have gone on to explain that the monks are merely so-called “brothers” of the “church”, and, as a matter of fact, none are members of the Catholic “Church” except the priests and bishops, archbishops, cardinals and popes. It is a thin excuse.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Tremendous Propaganda Machinery</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The world has never before seen anything like the propaganda machinery now used by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and it is getting more and more efficient every day. The results of its studies are fully available for both Hitler and Mussolini. The great convention of the Nazis at Nuremberg was a case in point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At intervals of five minutes more than 1,500 special trains from all parts of Germany bore 950,000 persons into Nuremberg to hear Herr Hitler make a bid for Papal support in his campaign to win over Czechoslovakia by lambasting the Russian republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler’s speeches have often been broadcast in the United States, but no democratic spokesman’s remarks have ever been put on the German circuit. However, Mussolini’s speech of November 1, 1936, was broadcast over all German stations in Italian and afterwards translated. The full power of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is behind both of these men, to make them as near gods on earth as is possible to do.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Cardinal Faulhaber, Contact Man</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">When the time came for the Hierarchy to let it be known that, under the guise of Nazism, they have seized the German republic, the contact man was Cardinal Faulhaber. The cardinal understood, all along, the part he was to play, and months before the trap was sprung he announced, speaking for himself as the archbishop of his archdiocese, “The archbishop is not aware that Der Fuehrer has ever withdrawn from the Catholic church.” He is listed as a Catholic in the German </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Who’s Who.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the title “Foe Who Calls on Hitler” the Associated </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Press </span><span class="font10">has, in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune,</span><span class="font10"> a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fine </span><span class="font10">picture of Cardinal Faulhaber. Then follows about a column of the most perfect bunk ever put on the cables. In the midst of the story is the statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The meeting was a preparatory step toward a reconciliation between Hitler and the Vatican, a move which General von Epp is known to favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why be so silly about the propaganda? Everybody in the United States knows that Hitler is a Catholic, Cardinal Faulhaber is a Catholic, and von Epp (governor of Bavaria) is a Catholic, and all three of them do what the pope wants them to do. The column story and the pretty picture of Faulhaber are all a part of the propaganda to feed Catholic Action, Fascism, Nazism, to the American people and make them like it, and the newspapers pass it on to the people apparently convinced that there is no bottom to the well and they can go on fooling the bulk of the people to the end of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At length came the planned and expected and certain “reconciliation” between Hitler and Faulhaber. There was a 3½-hour confab and love feast at which all was forgiven and forgotten, with opportunities for many a chuckle as to how the wool had been pulled over the people’s eyes, and then came the bishops’ pastoral letter glorifying the whole wicked conspiracy and advertising to all mankind that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Der Fuehrer saw the onmarch of Bolshevism from afar and bent his mind and energies toward deflecting this terrible menace from our German people and the whole western world. The German bishops regard it as their duty to support with all means at their disposal the head of the German reich in this defensive struggle.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Signs of Accord</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">When Papal diplomats have agreed upon any set course, one of the first things they do is to contrive to publish or have something published to the effect that the contemplated thing has not been done and will not be done. Newspapermen recognize this as a set policy of the Hierarchy. Hence, just before the announcement that Hitler and the Hierarchy are in accord, came a dispatch from Berlin saying that Heinrich Himmler, chief of the Gestapo (Nazi secret police), has publicly renounced the religion of the Roman Catholic sect. This clumsy attempt to make it appear that there are any serious divergences between Hitler and the Roman cult only serves to make it clear that one of Hitler’s righthand men has been a Catholic all along. And without a doubt he is still one. The people in general are now wide awake to the Jesuitical methods of attracting sympathy and avoiding blame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Crucifixes removed, as a bluff, from some of the schoolrooms in Oldenburg province, Germany, were replaced so that the Catholic peasants would come across better in giving up their grain to the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hiding evidence of the Inquisition, the Hitler government is removing the spikes of the Nuremberg Iron Maiden, which spikes were once used to penetrate the eyes, heart and kidneys of those condemned to die within her shell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Associated Press in a dispatch from Berlin, dated January 2, 1937, made the self-evident admission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Nazi government of Germany and the Catholic Church gave signs today of a return to cordial relations, with communism as a common foe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the friction between the Nazi government and the Roman Hierarchy is pure camouflage, in which Hitler is an adept. At heart he is what is called a “Practical Catholic”, and can be depended upon to take orders from Rome on every important matter affecting the interests of the Roman Hierarchy. The Roman Hierarchy labels each and every enemy “Communist”, without discrimination, and for the same reason that it labels every independent thinker, speaker or writer a “Bigot”.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Hitler’s Biography</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Adolf Hitler’s paternal grandmother, commonly called Maria Anna Sehicklgruber, was a harlot, and it is not certainly known, therefore, who was his grandfather paternal. On his mother’s side he apparently came of decent parents and grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Till he was 19 he wasted his time in school, and when his mother died he knew little. For years he made a precarious living fictitiously aging water colors on a warm hearth, to which he appended forged signatures of well-known artists, to make them appear old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After four years as a corporal in the World War he returned to Munich, Bavaria, to become an anti-Soviet spy. His first success as a speaker was as a Jew-baiter, and this has been a feature of every address since. When misstatements were called in question by a rabbi he and his friends advertised that thenceforth no Jews would be admitted to hear him speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His rise to power was due to connivance and consent of the Bavarian police, who violated their oaths. He did not hesitate to put to death those who elevated him to power. Count Revent-low and others formally accused him of being “a satellite of Rome”. He confesses to guidance by an inner voice, which is demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Like others on the inside, he knew, for years, that the guns Germany promised to destroy were stored for safe-keeping in the cellars and granaries of the Bavarian monasteries, and eventually he had them brought forth and used them and boasted of them publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the Putsch in Munich he was the first to desert his comrade, Ludendorff, and flee. When imprisoned he threatened to starve himself to death. His trial was a disgrace to justice. Thus, he is of reprobate ancestry, a forger, spy, Jew-baiter, liar, traitor, demoniac and coward, a Catholic, and the idol of millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler does not smoke, swear or drink. This Catholic “statesman”, and the Catholic “statesman” Mussolini, recognized the Catholic “statesman” General Franco on the same day. All are Fascists, i.e., representatives of Catholic Action.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Where Hitler First Saw the Swastika</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Under this headline the German magazine </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">lllustrierter Beobachter [Illustrated Observer] </span><span class="font10">in 1933 says that Hitler saw it the first time in 1897 and 1898 when he was a pupil in the parochial school of Benedictine convent at Lambach an der Traun, Austria. There he saw the crooked cross, or swastika, carved in stone above the convent well in the courtyard and on an escutcheon below a Philistine Dagon idol or a bishop’s fish-head miter above a praying-chair in the vestry of the convent. The swastika under the miter! What a significant pagan symbol of the fact that the modern Philistines, or the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are the real rulers of Hitler’s Nazi Germany!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler claimed that only 74 men were executed in the murderfest, in July, 1935; but between 1,500 and 2,000 families have since applied to German insurance companies for payments of insurance policies on the lives of husbands or brothers lost at that time. How many uninsured were slain is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In one of his speeches to the Nazis at Nuremberg, Herr Hitler made the statement that all German children belong to him, and that their mothers would bind themselves to him for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is almost unbelievable, but every person in Germany is required by law to “Heil Hitler”, and in order to keep within the law Hitler actually uses the salute himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">German salutes around railroad stations have so upset engineers and other railway men, accustomed to using the arms in conveying signals, that it has been necessary to make a new law forbidding Nazi salutes in railway stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On his forty-seventh birthday Hitler received (so it is claimed) 34,000 pairs of socks, 1,012 cradles and cartloads of flowers, besides other gifts.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Afraid of “The Terror”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Were the Germans anxious to vote in the last elections'? You bet they were. And why? Oh, the president of the Berlin police told all the 10,000 men under his command that one of their duties would be to see that every German man and every German woman in their districts must come to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the last German “election” every registered voter was compelled to go to the polls, except Jews. Each was given the opportunity to vote for Hitler. There was no opportunity to record a vote against him. How would you like that?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">At Stuttgart, Germany, Ludwig Schopp, a baker, was deprived of his tradesman’s license and placed under arrest, charged with sedition, because he turned off the radio in his restaurant during a speech by Adolf Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Knowing well that education of some sort is at the foundation of every state, the Nazi state has issued new textbooks for the German children, containing extracts from Hitler’s writings and biographical sketches of some of the worst politicians and cutthroats in the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">All private grammar schools in Germany have been abolished, and thus the absolute control of the very thoughts of every person in that terrible land grows nearer and nearer. All the world may now view the ideal of the Devil, which is that of Roman Catholic Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the Olympic Games, although a female from California distinguished herself by pressing her way to Hitler and kissing him on the cheek, almost without exception all the American athletes steadfastly refused to “Heil Hitler”, which most of the Germans had expected them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The demand of Hans Johst, Germany’s literature dictator, whose official title is President of the Reich Chamber of Literature, in an address at Weimar, Germany, warning the bookdealers that they must not use books as a private source of income, but in the service of the Third Reich, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the future I will eliminate the lukewarm among the bookdealers and I will not tolerate a dictatorship of the buying public. The buying public is our people, and our people want to be and shall be convinced and led; that is the essential principle of our age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Germany is being scoured to persuade all children born in 1925 and 1926 to join the Young Folk or HitlerGirls organizations.

<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>The Insane Fever for War</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The new toy soldiers, now pouring forth in a stream from Germany, are illustrated in the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle,</span><span class="font10"> 35 of them, and they are enough to make the heart sick. Every phase of warfare is represented, even to the scarlet-stained wrappings and the corpses, and the statement is made that the toysareforthe girls as well as the boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All German youths, no matter what they or their parents may believe, must join up with the Nazi youth organizations, at ten years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is significant that at the time this order was issued, affecting all Germany, word was also sent out that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font10"> youth organizations may remain intact. The intent is that all German youth shall be under the firm control of the Devil, as represented by the compact between the Roman Catholic Hitler and the Papacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The German edition </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of 'The Golden Age'</span><span class="font10"> reports Ernst Hauck, professor in a German boys’ school, as saying to his pupils:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The soldier in field gray throwing his last grenade; the dying sailor, falling through a murderer’s hand, and uttering as his last word the name of the Fuehrer [Hitler], these are to us far more godlike personalities than the crucified Jew [Christ Jesus, the Savior of men].</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Something ‘new under the sun’ are the “Student Rulers” now being selected to rule Germany. Three thousand carefully picked men will be trained at Croessin Lake, Vogelsang and Sonthofen, to take up the Nazi rule when Hitler lays it down. These men, so the accounts state, must be men of “character”, i.e., they must not use alcohol, tobacco or other indulgences for a set period, they must be “pitiless and merciless” in the suppression of those who disagree with them, and they are assured that they will be “saved from all material worries for the rest of their lives” [which, thank God, will be short].</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Millions of Germans between the ages of 25 and 45 are today carrying in their pockets military orders which specify just what barracks the holders must report to, and the day of mobilization, and the hour of arrival. The orders specify the clothing that must be brought, and the cooking utensils, and that they are acceptable as railway tickets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Nazi party of Germany makes winter contributions to the poor and needy, and the German army, as one of its duties, is entrusted with the task of collecting the “contributions”. The people, when the soldiers are at the door, are glad to part with portions of their salaries, their not-needed clothing, extra potatoes and other foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">People who know something about finance (there are but few who do) conclude that Germany may be able to borrow her way through the year 1937, but by that time her credit will be exhausted and she must get supplies in the old way, by taking them by force if she can get them. The present bluff is that Germany and Japan will pick Russia apart and divide the bones between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">William E. Dodd, United States ambassador to Germany, remarked of so-called “Western civilization”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With billions of debts unpaid, with billions of dollars spent yearly for bombing planes, great guns, scores of millions of small arms and all kinds of warships, the civilization which has borne the name of “Christian” for centuries is in a dilemma unsurpassed in 1,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Insane Treatment of Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because the Jews were for centuries the typical people of God, it suits the Devil well to maltreat them, hoping thus to do something further to dishonor God’s name; nevertheless, they are human creatures, and those who treat them unjustly, as Hitler is now doing, must answer for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the short space of three years, from 1933 to 1936, the number of Jews existing in Germany was decreased from 517,000 persons to 405,000, or about 21 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A Jew in Duisburg was recently sentenced to one and one-half years’ imprisonment for writing to a friend in America a personal letter containing some uncomplimentary remarks about Hitler and the Nazi party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Darmstadt a kind-hearted Jew was fined £4 for giving a home to a Gentile girl who was without work and penniless. The girl shared a room with his two daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Occasionally some Nazi has a gleam of intelligence and, realizing that the country was being injured by its fanaticism against the Jews, an offer was made that if 2,000 Jewish doctors exiled from Germany would return and serve in the German Army Medical Corps they would be accepted back. In other words, Germany contemplates war and thinks maybe it is not so bright chasing out all the capable Jewish surgeons, after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some idea of the depths to which the German nation has descended under the Nazi regime may be found in facts cited by the American Jewish Committee, 461 Fourth Avenue, New York City, that in some districts Jews are prohibited from traveling by certain trains; in other places they cannot get a coffin made or hire a hearse; in other places they cannot get medical treatment without the official consent of the Nazi party; a landlady may rent a room to a Jew, but the moment she gives him a meal she becomes Jewish, subject to all the penalties; a Jewish widow must discharge her Christian help if the son of the widow takes his meals there, even though he rooms elsewhere; Jewish dealers in foods are denied the privilege of purchase, and are thus forced out of business; in the textile trades the employment of even one Jewish apprentice is sufficient to cancel the license of the firm; all Jews have been completely driven out of the newspaper trade: not a Jewish news agent is left to do business in the country, and Jewish booksellers, architects and cinema proprietors have all been eliminated. These are but a few of the restrictions imposed in this land which was once considered the center of a modern, decent civilization.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Killing Them by Inches</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">A Jewish widow in Germany earned a living by keeping a small shop. The Nazis came and plastered the shop with posters saying that no good German would buy from a Jew. She hung in the window the last photograph of her son, and beside it his Iron Cross and a letter from his commander that he had died fighting valiantly for his country. In the night her window was smashed and the photograph, letter and Iron Cross were gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The so-called “Aryans” are taking from the Jews the only means by which the latter may maintain themselves. The latest is a declaration that hereafter Aryans will handle the rag trade, on the ground that the present operators, the Jews, are not sufficiently reliable. This is merely a slow and cowardly method of robbery and murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All cattle dealers wear brown trousers when working, but the “court” at Nuremberg sentenced a Jewish cattle dealer to six weeks’ imprisonment because, said the “court”, Jews must not wear brown trousers, because they might be confused with the uniforms of the Nazi Storm Troops. Can you imagine such a “court”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The German “government” confiscated 25 percent of the property of wealthy Jews, as “security” equal to the “escape tax” levied upon them if they leave the country. This 25 percent, however, has been levied upon their businesses while they are going concerns, and is therefore much more than the tax that is levied when estates are liquidated. The Jews are being crowded to the wall by the most nearly perfect system of gradually increased oppressions ever witnessed 021 earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Recently there have been several instances in which the German government has ordered Jews who were born in that country to leave within 24 hours. No reasons for these deportations were given. Most of the deportees, businessmen, were ruined by the order and could do nothing to help themselves.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>The Cause of Hitler’s Insanity</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The scientific, truthful explanation of Hitler’s insane conduct lies in the fact that he is possessed of devils, similar to the seven that the Lord cast out of Mary Magdalene, and others. It is claimed that, much like King Saul, his nerves are gone and he is suffering from fits of crying and inability to sleep. For hours at a time he sits doing nothing but listen to a musician playing Wagner and Beethoven symphonies and refuses to talk to anyone on even the most important international business. Without a doubt he is demonized and well on the road to insanity, and deserves his fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Incidentally, the whole German people, engaged in ‘heiling Hitler’, are in reality offering their praise and homage to the Devil, and hailing him as their god and their deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Luigi Sturzo writes in the French </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Journal des Nations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitler is unfortunately not able to offer everlasting peace in the name of the German people. He has his ‘voices’ which talk to him in something like somnambulism. Today those voices tell him ‘ Peace for twenty-five years’; but what if the same voices say to him tomorrow, ‘Peace only for five years’? And when they tell him ‘Instant war’, decreed in one night (because Hitler likes nightly conferences), regardless of the ‘twenty-five years’ peace pledge, confirmed by plebiscite? The German people have nothing to say, not today and not tomorrow. Their ballot is of no consequence, their vote is of no value, neither at home nor abroad. And that is the tragedy of Europe.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>His Responsibility Seems Complete</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler’s responsibility for accepting the toadyism of hypocrites, and rewarding those that refuse to bow to him with prison sentences and even torture in the prisons themselves, seems to be complete, as will readily be gathered from the following extracts from his book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf [My Struggle']:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The form demanded once: Never contradict, but whatsoever His Majesty is pleased with, that approve I Just at this place free manhood was needed most; some day the monarchic institution would have perished anyhow because of this toadyism, and it was toadyism and nothing else. A man, willing and ready to stand up for a cause, cannot and will never be a spineless toady or a knave. He who has the welfare and progress of an institution at heart will hang on to it with his last heartbeat and will not stand for any wrong he may notice within it. Disregarding that he may endanger his own person, he will strongly warn the erown-bearer and will try to influence him. . . . With very rare exceptions monarchs are not examples of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">wisdom </span><span class="font9">or intelligence or even of character, as some would</span></p>

Only the professional toadies and sycophants believe they are; but to all other upright people—and such are the most valuable in the state— the toady presentation of monarchs as supermen can be only repugnant.

No, indeed I the luck to have a great man as monarch is so scarce among nations that they must be satisfied if the malice of fate will at least spare them its worst mistake.</span></p>

[Pages 126,127] To the political leader the religious teachings and institutions of his people will always be inviolable; otherwise he must not be a politician, but should be a reformer, if he has the necessary qualifications.

<p><span class="font10">On pages 187 ff.

<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Military Preparations</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The German people do not yet know it, probably, but a huge part of all their savings has gone into munitions. Winston Churchill, former chancellor of the British Government Exchequer, estimates that in 1935 alone the German government invested $4,000,000,000 in war preparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Krupp Gun Works, so busy making plows, etc., according to the peace talkers of fifteen years ago, is now making more guns than ever since the blood-curdling days of old Kaiser Wilhelm, and there is alleged to be a shortage of skilled labor for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Britons are nervous over the discovery that Germany now has 20,000 airplanes; also that the Hindenburg has gone out of its way to Ily over most British airports and shipyards and even the Manchester ship canal. All the military men claim that if war breaks out in Europe the first 24 hours will decide the issue. So many noncombatants will be slain that the morale of the losing side will be broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On seven of the Frisian islands, off the coast of Holland, Germany is building underground airdromes large enough to house 5,000 bombing planes. The planes that can be housed in these airdromes could carry loads sufficient to wipe out the inhabitants of all the principal cities in the British Isles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle,</span><span class="font10"> referring to Germany’s preparation for war, lists 12 airdromes, 6 underground in one village; another with 20 sheds each 250 feet long, for 200 airplanes and 300 pilots; a third with 250 planes and 1,000 personnel; a fourth with 200 planes; a fifth with underground accommodations for 800 men; a sixth with a gas-proof underground hangar, etc. If these planes are not intended to be used against England, the nearest neighbor across the North sea, against whom are they intended? They are strung out along the line between Hamburg and Bremen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are forty aviation factories in Germany. In 1934 the annual budget for military aviation was 211,000,000 marks; in 1935 it was 500,000,000 marks; in 1936 it was 980,000,000 marks. In four years the aviation personnel grew from 12,000 to 60,000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new Air Ministry Building in Berlin has more than two thousand offices. Two of the German aircraft factories have more employees and occupy more floor space than all the aircraft plants in the United States. The Tempelhof commercial airport is being trebled in size, and aims to be, when completed, the largest, most complete airport in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By the airship Hindenburg Germany is now only two nights away from the United States; and with such a government as they have there, that is close enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The new military highways of Germany are the finest in the world. Four lanes wide, and the center is landscaped. All crossings of every kind are eliminated. Villages are skirted. Yellow glass reflectors mark the edge of the paving. The shoulders are of pebble and asphalt mixture and may be felt at once by the driver. The cost averages $320,000 a mile; and 4,400 miles are projected, over a period of seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. A. Salter, M.P., speaking at Canterbury, Kent, England, of the crushing of German militarism in 1918, said, reflectively:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We crushed her under our heels and she was absolutely powerless and impotent. We blockaded her coasts for eighteen months after the Armistice, in order to make her sign terms of peace which she would not have done voluntarily. Her navy was at the bottom of Scapa Flow, she was not allowed to have a fleet or an army, except one hundred thousand men for internal police purposes. She was not allowed to have any conscription or heavy artillery, and all munition factories were blown up. She was not allowed to have an armed man within thirty miles of her frontiers, and in some places a hundred miles, or to have an air force, and we loaded her with a reparations debt of £240,000,000,000, a fantastic figure, to crush her economically for generations. Today our statesmen are calling out that German militarism is a menace to the world.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Courts a Mockery</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">For expressing the self-evident truth that “war brings terror and despair to mankind, and there is nothing heroic about it”, Carl von Ossietzky, German editor, has been in prison during the entire time of Hitler’s reign, and is now dying of heart disease—virtually murdered for loving peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a recent trial at Berlin a trade unionist by the name of Markwitz asked the Nazi court, “Must I tell the truth </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">T’</span><span class="font10"> Receiving an affirmative answer, he opened his shirt and showed his torn and broken body and solemnly declared that his confession given to his torturers was false. Yet, in the face of all that, he was “found guilty”. The Nazi courts have become objects of bitter contempt by decent people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Magdeburg 150 men and women accused of expressing dissatisfaction with the German government went on trial before the dreaded People’s Tribunal—corresponding to the Revolutionary Tribunal of the French Revolution. All the defendants were held a year in prison before trial, with death as the probable result in many instances. There were 18 women among the 150. It is not known if any of Jehovah’s witnesses are in this group of sufferers; but probably so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Bremerhaven the Hansa Provincial Court sentenced five persons (none of them Jehovah’s witnesses) to imprisonment for fifteen months to two years for merely listening to a radio program from Moscow. When it comes to Jehovah's witnesses, the only activity permitted them is the sale of Bibles. As late as April, and since the alleged amnesty, one of Jehovah’s witnesses from Pivitsheide, near Detmold, was given ten months’ imprisonment for giving out some literature explaining the Bible. The Lord’s statement that His true and faithful followers would be “as sheep in the midst of wolves” is exactly correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Melbourne </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Workers’ Weekly</span><span class="font10"> contains a special report from its Berlin correspondent on the night trials which have been conducted at Dresden:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In order to exclude the public, the proceedings were held in the night, from twelve o’clock till three in the morning. In the courtroom three Storm Troopers stood beside the judge’s bench. If a defendant failed to reply to a question in the manner desired, he was taken away at once by the Storm Troopers, through a passage from the court into a cellar, where he was frightfully maltreated and then dragged back before the judges. If he still refused to give the desired answers, he was taken away again and subjected to worse tortures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same account refers to the conditions at Sachsenburg, where there are between 300 and 400 of Jehovah’s witnesses. In this hellhole 1,327 prisoners are crowded into two dormitories, and there are only four privies for all. Several victims have been beaten to death. Women are beaten, as well as men.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Tortures in Prisons</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">In the first year of Hitler 280,308 persons were imprisoned, 184 were shot “trying to escape”, 212 men and women were beheaded, and 49,000 were sent to concentration camps. Upon his release from fourteen months’ imprisonment at Frankfurt, Dr. Robert Rohme, an Austrian, made the statement, on his arrival in England:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you want to find a gentleman in Germany today you have to go to the prisons, because all the gentlemen are there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Madame Soermus, Russian concert artist, touring Great Britain, declares that in Czechoslovakia she saw a prisoner, just escaped from Germany, who had the Swastika branded upon his head. The members of the group of four, of whom he was one, told of seeing one man killed in a concentration camp by tying a string to his tongue. A brick was tied to the other end of the string, and when it was dropped the poor man’s tongue was pulled out by the roots. He died shortly, in exquisite agony, as a matter of course. It was an illustration of Catholic Action in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“A German major attached to the secret division of the Reichswehr ministry recently boasted quite openly that Germany has at her disposal methods of making obstinate prisoners amenable by injection. The fact that the methods employed completely destroy the victim mentally and physically is no deterrent, of course, to the gentle Nazi nature. This Reichswehr officer told of methods of the Middle Ages, when the inner organs of victims were slowly destroyed by mixing minced hair with their food. (Powdered diamond dust was also used.) Today more humane methods are used. Why minced hair, when the effects of thorn-apple juice are known? This drug destroys the brain ganglia and brings about a terrible state of exhaustion.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“At</span><span class="font10"> Dachau Camp official punishment for prisoners’ misdeeds included whipping, beating on the soles of the feet with iron rods (the bastinado), branding with lighted cigars, and beating prisoners with rubber hosepipes until the victims became unconscious.

At Sachsenburg, a worker named Knauch was forced by men with whips to stand with arms extended until he fainted. At Heuberg a man named Leipowitsch was made to work until he collapsed and, as he sweated, ice-cold water was poured over him.

<p><span class="font10">The following is the statement of Frau Berg-Andre of her treatment in a German prison while she -was undergoing examination, as published in the Manchester </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font9"> was generally questioned from 9 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m. each day. For this I sat bound on a chair, in such a way that my hands were tied down to my feet underneath the chair. For four days running a worker was beaten in my presence, in the hope that he would make a statement against Edgar [her husband, subsequently slain by the Nazis, after being brutally mistreated]. While I sat there for hours on end bent double this man was severely beaten four or five times a day. As I made no statement I was shut up for six weeks in an underground cell for “confinement in the dark”. There I got warm food only once every four days; for the rest I had nothing but dry bread and water. Meanwhile there were more questionings while I sat bent in the chair, and I was knocked about so that I still have marks of this mishandling on my body. As a result of this treatment I fell ill. After repeated requests a doctor arrived, but he did not examine me at all, but only told the wardress that I might lie on the bed when I wished and have pills to relieve the pain whenever I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Manchester </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font10"> has published a number of stories similar to the above, and these have been denied by German officials, with the result that other and yet other women tell of their experiences in this land of demoniacs. A later letter from another woman, published in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font10"> of September 7, tells how at the police examination her head was jerked up with a pencil thrust into her nose; she was compelled to kneel, and while in this position was beaten with a rubber truncheon; was pulled to and fro by the hair; had a revolver pressed against her temple; was then thrown into a cellar, and, although arms and legs were black-and-blue from beatings, was compelled to go through a great variety of exercises and postures until finally she fainted from pain and weakness. This torture was repeated at intervals, accompanied by jeering on the part of the “men” acting as custodians.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">G. W., writing in the Manchester </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian, </span><span class="font10">tells a pathetic story of the fate of his faithful wife. When Hitler first came into power he was arrested and imprisoned for 2½ years. During all that time his wife contrived to keep herself and two children alive. When his term expired the Nazis kept him several weeks over time, and told his wife he had been released. Ten weeks later the Nazis told her the truth, that he was still being held. At length her courage gave way, and when in despair she committed suicide, they then gave him his liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A contemporary setting forth the development of Nazi culture gives some interesting details :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a place called Bochum, a Nazi department store manager named Unversaght used his superior position to seduce twenty-eight girl employees under the age of sixteen. Eight of these girls became pregnant, and the manager arranged for his friend, Dr. Badenhauer, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">perform illegal operations. Protests by the parents ultimately led to the arrest of the two men, but, as they are active officials of the Nazi party, they were released twenty-four hours after arrest.

<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Government by Racketeers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New Masses</span><span class="font10"> contains a copyrighted article by John L. Spivak in which the information is brought to light that all Germany is dicta-phoned, the dictaphones being attached to the telephone in such a manner that everything said in the office (whether the telephone is in use or not) is recorded at police headquarters. The Nazi chieftains are racketeers pure and simple, living in greatest luxury while their underlings shake down businessmen for a percentage of their receipts. One of the diplomats interviewed by Mr. Spivak said to him: “It is not a government. Here gangsters have got control of a great country and have become a world power to be reckoned with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Winston Churchill, in an address in Paris, denounced German rule as that of the gag and muzzle; of spies, eavesdroppers and delators; of private conversations caught up and delivered to the Secret Police; of arrests and internments without trial; of trials by party courts for crimes hitherto unknown to the civil law; of the treatment of grown men like schoolboys; of forced parades and cheering for this or that slogan; and of the bullying to death of teachers and authors in the concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Westbrook Pegler tells of a case of “sedition” at Cuxhaven, Germany. Nazi agents boarded an American ship and in the private locker of Lawrence Simpson, a native American sailor, discovered a letter which said, in part, “Our American democracy is much superior to the Nazi theory, and Hitler is, to my mind, a madman.” Simpson was thereupon arrested for sedition, and was in prison fifteen months awaiting trial. He has since been released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A German housewife entertaining some friends was annoyed by radio reception of a Nazi speech and said to one of her children, “Turn off that nonsense.” One of the guests reported the matter to the police, and now the housewife must report to the police station every day for six weeks and listen to the Nazi programs. Imagine a country where a guest would do such a thing, and fear not to do it; and imagine a country where the tyranny is so unspeakably small-souled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the night of June 13, 1936, in the city of Danzig, sixteen Storm Troopers attacked the dwelling of three unarmed workers, and in their frenzy shot dead two of their own number. Thereupon the Danzig police arrested the men who had been attacked (often duplicated elsewhere), and at the funeral of the two men slain by their own comrades Herr Hitler sent wreaths, and Himmler, chief of the German secret police, attended in person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Germany made improvements on the inquisitions of the Dark Ages. Everybody had to vote for Hitler, to show they were for the Nazi state; and then on the German “Labor Day”, May 1, all Germany took a day off from work and were given free beer and sausage, while the wages went on as usual. The bribe worked well. Jehovah’s witnesses, women, were flogged at the concentration camps at Mohringen and Jauer. The Gestapo, secret police, Papal inquisitors, arrest perfectly innocent persons, torture them until they “confess”, and sometimes extend the torture until physical and mental ruin result. Many prisoners have been beaten to death and others have died a lingering death after the Gestapo of Ratti and Hitler get through with them. The theory is to keep the people contented with occasional free beer and free sausages.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Some Recent Blasphemies</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the recent blasphemies in Nazidom are: “Hitler is a new, a greater and a more powerful Jesus Christ”; “Adolf Hitler is the real Holy Ghost”; and, “The creator of mankind appeared 2,000 years ago in the form of Christ. Today God reveals himself to the German people again in the form of Hitler.” The first of these statements was by Alois Spaniol, leader of the Nazis in the Saar; the second was by Dr. Kerri, chairman of the Prussian Diet; and the third was a statement in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Welt des Kaufmanns, </span><span class="font10">a trade paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In an address at Nuremberg, Germany, Schutz-staffel Leader Schulz, of Pomerania, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I ask you, Who was greater, Christ or Hitler ? Christ at the time of his death had twelve disciples who weren’t even completely faithful to him. Hitler today has a people of seventy millions behind him. National Socialism claims in all earnestness: “I am the Lord thy God: thou shalt have no other gods besides me. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On a previous occasion Streicher, anti-Semitic governor of Franconia, made the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the salvation of the German people, there will come the salvation, through Adolf Hitler, of other sick peoples who cannot save themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Protestant pastors circulated pamphlets showing that the Hitler Youth worship Hitler instead of Christ, and thank him before and after meals in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Leader, my Leader, whom God has given to me, protect and preserve me through my life. Thou hast saved Germany from the deepest distress, and I have to thank thee for my daily bread. Stay with me and never leave me, Leader, my Leader, my faith and my light.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Driven to desperation by what they see going on around them the German Evangelical church, in a 4,000-word protest to the Government, said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Honor is being accorded to Herr Hitler which is due only to God. His judgment is used as the basis for all decisions, political, moral and legal, and he himself is haloed with the religious authority of a national priest and even made an intermediary between God and the nation.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Signs of Protestant Dissolution</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Signs of Protestant dissolution are that fewer persons are going to church at all, and there is less bitterness between the Rome-controlled state and the Protestant sects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Brandenburg 422 out of 1,753 Protestant pulpits are vacant, in Pomerania 229 out of 802 pulpits are vacant, and in Saxony, where Protestantism had its origin, 574 are vacant out of a total of 1,680.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For 231 years a wall divided the Protestant from the Catholic half of the Church of St. Esprit, in Heidelberg, but, now that the Protestant church has ceased to exist, having been merged with the Catholic everywhere, the intervening wall has appropriately been torn down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For not ringing the church bells the pastor of a Protestant church at Immerkath, Saxony, at the time of Adolf Hitler’s election, was forced to march through the village with someone who had voted “No” at the election. Manure was repeatedly thrown in his face. He was taken to Nazi headquarters, where he was beaten with wooden and rubber clubs bristling with rusty nails.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Violence to Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses do not vote to uphold present murderous governments, and are therefore special objects of the Devil’s wrath and of those who have his spirit. The following are some of their experiences at the last election. Names of places are omitted because their persecutions are still going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At A---15 men dragged a man out of his</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">garden, took him to the polls, and threatened to kill him if he did not vote. He refused, and 48 hours later was still in the prison to which he was cast for his refusal. Another witness was spat upon by about 20 S.A. men while he was at the station house: he was detained overnight. At B----</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">one of the witnesses was so abused as he left his boat that he was obliged to put himself under a doctor’s care, after spending a night in prison.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>The Remedy</span></h5>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font10">LL the nations of the earth are in great distress and perplexity. Conditions continue to grow worse. What, if anything, is the remedy? All reasonable people can now see that man’s efforts to remedy the evils have failed. Men are imperfect and very selfish, and if a few men put forth their very best endeavors to bring about good, other selfish men interfere and prevent the people from receiving the benefits of such efforts. Those who believe the Bible know the reason for these conditions. We are now in the last days and perilous times have come, and God’s expressed determination is to destroy selfishness and wicked rule. Therefore Jehovah says to the people of earth who will hear (Matthew 12:18,21): “Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the [nations]. And in his name shall the [nations] trust.” The kingdom of God under Christ is the only remedy and hope for humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The masses of the people are today in darkness concerning the truth of God’s kingdom and know not which way to turn. Speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ and for the people Jehovah says (Isaiah 42:6,7): T will give thee for a guarantee to the people, for a light unto the nations, to open their blind eyes.’ At Isaiah 55:4 God says to the people concerning the right way: “Behold, I have given him [Christ Jesus] for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” No imperfect and selfish men can safely lead the people. They must be guided by the great Prophet of Jehovah God, Christ Jesus, who leads them in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only way for the people of good will to now know the right way to go is to obtain a knowledge of God’s word as set forth in the Bible. For a long while there have been some men and women faithfully serving God and Christ, and now the time has come for Christ, the Light of the world, to destroy all wickedness and put in operation His righteous government. And therefore He says to His faithful witnesses: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” (Isaiah 60:1) What is the purpose of having these witnesses testify to the truth? The Lord answers (Isaiah 60: 2): ‘For, behold, the darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people.’ His purpose is that the people shall now have an opportunity to learn the truth and come out of darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Foolish people will look to some earthly or human leader who rants and harangues them about what he can and will do. Such are blind to the truth and follow blind guides, and therefore blindly and foolishly shout: “Salvation is of Hitler,” or some other creature. Those who continue in this foolish way shall perish. The Scriptures truly show that all who will receive everlasting life and blessings ascribe all salvation to God and His* kingdom under Christ and these will not compromise by bowing down to Satan and his organization. Upon earth today there are millions of people of good will, and these are now forming into a great multitude, all serving God. They are shown as having their faces and hearts turned to God and His kingdom and saying, “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb [Christ Jesus, the King of the world].” (Revelation 7:10) Those people who thus put their trust in God and His kingdom are commanded by the Lord to say to others who will hear (Revelation 22:17): ‘Come and learn the truth and partake of life freely.’ The Lord is putting those words into the mouth of His people that they may inform others of the only remedy for human suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This message does not mean that God is trying to induce people to serve Him. It is merely a warning to the people that those who desire to get life and attending blessings must give heed to that warning. After having heard the message of warning every person will make his own choice and take the full responsibility. By His prophet Jehovah says that when the people are warned and refuse to give heed to that warning they shall die in their iniquity, but if they give heed to the warning they shall live. (Ezek. 3:17-21) God lays the obligation upon His witnesses to give this message of warning to the people, and they are joyfully doing so in obedience to His commandment. Jehovah now favors the people by sending them the message of warning telling of the impending disaster upon the wicked world, and at the same time telling them of the only means of escape and salvation, and the remedy for their ills and sufferings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each one must make his own choice. The agents of Satan will lie about Jehovah’s witnesses and misrepresent God’s message of truth. The foolish will listen to and believe such lies. The wise persons will hear and give heed to the Word of God as set forth in the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In front of the Thuringia courthouse gallows were erected for the nonvoters to be strung up. The erection of the gallows took place while the local Nazi party was there with music and a procession. This is not a joke, but a fact corroborated by many eye-witnesses. In G---- six</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">masked Nazis at midnight entered the home of one of Jehovah’s witnesses 62 years of age, took him out of bed and cut off his full beard, but only on the one side of his face.

<p><span class="font10">being done in the Third Reich (Nazi Germany). At H---- three of Jehovah’s witnesses were</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">placed in detention for one week for non-participation in the election. At K---- a Jehovah’s</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In one place 60 of Jehovah’s witnesses were discharged from their positions for not voting, and were additionally punished with six weeks’ suspension of relief. These discharges were at the instigation of the N.S.D.A.P. party. A form letter was used stating that the discharge had been agreed upon, and the reason, “Endangering the Commonwealth.” Instead of “Yours truly” the subscription was “Heil Hitler”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“To Mrs. D. in F. On March 31, 1936, 30 marks are due to cancel debt to the city building fund and 19.50 marks on A.L. are also due. If you do not pay the amount within three days to the city cashier I shall ruthlessly proceed with a compulsory public auction of your property.

I therefore request an early reply if you intend to vacate your homestead. In case of refusal I shall duly call upon the court of arbitration. Heil Hitler!

<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>The Inquisitional Spies</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">August 31, 1936, unprecedented mass arrests took place, and about 1,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses were taken into custody by the Secret Police; 300 more after the convention in Lucerne, among them a good number of those who were in Lucerne. Since, eleven witnesses have, according to official statements, committed “suicide” in prison or concentration camp. All of those were brave, courageous and steadfast witnesses and, no doubt, were tortured to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To hide this appalling fact, their bruised and broken bodies in the coffins were covered to the utmost, and when the wife of one of them, seeing a large blue spot on the face of her dead husband, and realizing that he was foully murdered, attempted to tear the cover from his body, she was immediately prevented by the guard from so doing. Likewise nobody was permitted to see more than the face of the other victims of the Hierarchical inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mass arrests were brought about in this way: A witness in Berlin, who mimeographed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and thus served about 1,000 of the publishers, rented a room to a Nazi spy who soon feigned interest in the truth of God’s Word. Though this witness was warned by other publishers not to trust the Nazi, he continued to confide in him. But the spy got up during the night and watched through a window how the witness mimeographed the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tower.</span><span class="font10"> After the spy had gathered sufficient evidence the publisher was arrested, and with him all whose names and addresses were found in his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the women publishers in Berlin was arrested in September because she refused to tell the whereabouts of her father. As soon as he heard of her arrest he came home, and was arrested at once. Both are still in prison, and no word has since come from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany is at present so violent that in small towns, where they are personally well known, no two or three of them may be seen talking together in the street without danger of falling into the hands of the Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is reported that some readers of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> in America are so unwise as to send numbers of it to some in Germany, inserting a German note, “Bitte weitergeben” (Please pass it on). The post-office censors take notice of it, but without intercepting it. Thus the addressee receives several numbers without any difficulties. But later the police arrest him because he has not notified the authorities and not refused to accept the prohibited literature. If possible, the Inquisition ascertains to whom </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font10">has been passed on, and then those recipients also fall into its hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The way the spy system was worked in Magdeburg, and perhaps in other places, was as follows: An apparent peddler calls at the home of one of Jehovah’s people, remarking about the world’s general distress and unrest. The people of God are eager, honest and helpful. He is told the cause and the cure of earth’s unrest. He feigns great interest, expressing a desire to hear more about it. His business engagements make it hard to give more time just then; may he return Sunday? He comes, makes notes of all the texts quoted, and other interesting points. He regrets that he never before knew of people who had knowledge of these wonderful things. It is a pity that there are not more persons of the same faith in the town. He learns that there are more, and where some of them live. There he or other agents repeat the procedure. Thus, recently, in Magdeburg alone, eighteen of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested for spreading “subversive propaganda”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every home in Germany is now under surveillance. On March 29, 1936, day of the plebiscite, one of Jehovah’s witnesses was at his home in the remote suburbs when his appointed overseer or spy appeared with an S.S. and an S.A. man and demanded that he come to town and vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The witness declined, was arrested, taken to jail in a motorcycle, threatened with murder, and was jailed for his own protection.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>A Few of the Thousands Imprisoned</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Four of Jehovah’s witnesses, women, were sent to prison at Stettin for terms of three to five months for attempting to worship God in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. Ten days later fifteen of Jehovah’s witnesses, men, were sentenced to imprisonment at Berlin for refusal to serve in the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Westfaelische Landeszeitung</span><span class="font10"> reports that Charlotte Tem-ming, 63 years of age, was sentenced to one year in prison by a court at Dortmund, because she went from house to house preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom, and placed Bibles and the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses with the people. She was given an additional three days in jail for refusal to “Heil Hitler”. The Inquisition is coming, coming, and is far on its way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah can put a man on earth who will maintain his integrity.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Forty-four of Jehovah’s witnesses from Remscheid and Lennep were on trial at Wuppertal for continuing their work in honor of Jehovah’s name, after such activities had been forbidden. Ten were acquitted, fifteen were fined, two were granted amnesty, and the remaining seventeen were sentenced to prison terms of one to six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Five of Jehovah’s witnesses were tried at Hamburg for forsaking not the assembling of themselves together, and for passing from one to another leaflets urging those who love God to remain steadfast in the faith. Hitler’s Papal court sentenced them to imprisonment up to two years for their faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Four of Jehovah’s witnesses at Koenigsberg were sent to prison for terms of one to four months for meeting together as Christ commanded, and for saying in court that there would be no more wars if all states obeyed God’s commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In one German city a paralytic was brought into court on a stretcher, accused of being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and of having given to visitors printed slips referring to Matthew 24 and The Revelation. He was sentenced to one month in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany may no longer even bury their dead without persecution. At Bielefeld fifteen were arrested at a funeral at which one of their number was the spokesman. They were imprisoned for terms ranging from two months to a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the Great Criminal Court of Bochum, Jehovah’s witness Laux was given a month in prison for giving a woman a Bible and a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty</span><span class="font10"> booklet, yet within sixty days thereafter the German minister for ecclesiastical matters, Kerri, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All contentions that the free exercise of worship has in any way been interfered with is outrageous slander. Since the National-Socialists are in power such a thing has never and nowhere occurred.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Petty, Unspeakable Meanness</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">One of Jehovah’s witnesses, after release from a term of imprisonment in Germany, relates that in the second week of his imprisonment he was denied the use of a Bible, in accord with a ruling of the “Department of Justice” in such cases made and provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Berlin, the public prosecutor made the statement that in Germany Jehovah’s witnesses may not meet together to study the Bible. Those who did so were given sentences of imprisonment from three to six months. At Dortmund, for refusing to “Heil Hitler”, sentences ranged from three months to two and one half years for thirty-one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An Associated Press release from Berlin stated that on the occasion of Hitler’s birthday fines and jail sentences were canceled against 240,340 Germans, and pending cases against 254,674 were dismissed. All right. Let the figures stand. They show a half million people hounded by the regime before the release was effected. Jehovah’s witnesses were </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">excluded</span><span class="font10"> from the benefits of the so-called ‘amnesty’, except in the case mentioned below.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370310_files/g_E_19370310-18.png" alt="" style="width:233pt;height:299pt;">
<p><span class="font8">“Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go no more out.”—Revelation 3: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ In the twinkling of an eye, . . . changed. ’ ’—1 Cor. 15: 52.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">A note from Germany discloses that for some time now none of Jehovah’s witnesses are being released from a certain concentration camp unless they first sign a pledge not to reveal to anybody the conditions in the camp, and the tortures suffered, and unless they agree also never again to commemorate the Lord’s death, never to attend another Bible study, and never again to be active as a witness for Jehovah. As a consequence, they refuse to sign, and are in custody indefinitely, waiting for Jehovah’s good time to deliver them and to crush the defamers of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rather a comical thing is reported at one of the concentration camps (location not given) where 150 of Jehovah’s witnesses were incarcerated. After many fiery tests each one was asked individually if he would continue his forbidden activity after his dismissal from the camp. Eighty answered, “We shall continue to serve Jehovah.” Seventy gave elusive or vacillating answers. Result: The eighty were dismissed ; the seventy were kept prisoners, and it shows Jehovah’s supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Manchester </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font10"> had the following regarding Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Amongst the victims of religious persecution in Germany are the so-called “Ernste Bibelforscher, ” a society for the study and propagation of the Scriptures independently of the churches. They represent several tendencies, but in certain parts of Germany, especially in the west, they have something of the character of early Christians and there are some that recall the Anabaptists, who at one time were so strong in Germany. They disseminate religious pamphlets and hold meetings for Bible reading and Communion service. Many of them are very old people—it is quite a common sight to see aged couples going from house to house and trying to make conversions. Very often entire families are members of the society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They have a certain following amongst the young, especially amongst students who are of a religious turn of mind, reject drinking and dueling. There has been a tendency to laugh at them as “cranks,” but since the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship they have earned a good deal of respect and have increased their following (which was always considerable) by their absolute refusal to compromise in religious matters. Some have been arrested or sent to concentration camps for their refusal to say “Hail, Hitler!” because they maintain that no temporal authority is entitled to this expression of reverence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They have been forbidden as a society and 47 of them are now being tried at Elberfeld (this is another of the “monster trials” that are now so common in Germany).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They have nothing to do with polities, but are naturally amongst the most obdurate opponents of the “neo-Paganism” which is encouraged by the Nazis. Nor is any political charge brought against them; in fact, the indictment expressly states that whereas they belonged to a forbidden society, “some of them went from house to house spreading the Word of God in accordance with the beliefs of the society, others discussed, exchanged, or circulated publications of the International Bible Research Workers, collected money for their assemblies, and held meetings at which they expounded the Bible and held Communion service. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Eight of the accused are sixty or over; three are seventy or over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sentence will probably be passed in the next few days.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Persecutions Traced to Priests</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">An Oslo (Norway) paper had an article about Jehovah’s witnesses of which the following account is a translation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the time when Hitler became chancellor, the priests were glad—yes, they rejoiced. But the people were ignorant of the fact that the Catholic Hierarchy was backing him and pushing him to the fore. In one church in a large town the altar was bedecked with a large swastika. The priest cried out to his audience, “Just as Jesus was sent to earth to save the Jews, so God has sent Hitler in these days to save Germany.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the same town one of Jehovah’s witnesses went round and proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God, to comfort the sorrowing, suffering and the workless, and there were plenty of these. He did it, just like the others, because God had commanded it. (Matthew 24:14) At one of the doors he met a priest. When the priest heard that it was one of Jehovah’s witnesses he became very angry and said in a bitter tone, “We have written to Hitler, and he has replied, ‘I will do what I can’; and now your days are numbered.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the priest’s remarks one can understand that there have been many priests in the conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses, which priests have sought the help of the chancellor in the carrying out of their evil plans. Now Hitler has done practically all he can against Jehovah’s witnesses. But why, then, are the priests sighing and crying now about the methods of Hitler, the savior they have chosen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The above-mentioned Jehovah’s witness has been unjustly punished nine months. In the same town about 300 witnesses for Jehovah have been treated in a similar fashion. One who was confined in a concentration camp for over fifteen months was twice put up against the wall to be shot, because he had definitely refused to compromise in any way with Hitlerism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In one prison there were about thirty of Jehovah’s witnesses and while they were there Easter came. The prison priest said that he would be pleased to meet them in the prison church to hear their views on the Bible. Jehovah’s witnesses decided to meet the priest on an appointed day in the church. When the set day arrived and they were gathered together, one of the prison chiefs came in and abused them because in the letters which they received from their friends and relatives there were Scripture texts given and also citations from books which Jehovah’s witnesses use to proclaim the gospel to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When this Was over the priest came in with a long face and a pious appearance as on a public prayer day, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">naturally</span><span class="font9"> he knew nothing of what had just taken place. Now the examination should begin. All went well for about an hour. The priest concluded that the treatment which they had just received would take their courage from them. Yes, they had appealed to Hitler for help, but, naturally, he could not do everything ; it had to be some of his men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The priest got in a fix several times because of Bible proofs and questions. He became angry and wanted to leave, but the prisoners kept him and reminded him of his responsibility and said: “On the 17th of April we keep the Passover as a remembrance of the death of Jesus Christ. It would be good if you could get us some bread and wine. You have the responsibility to do’ that. ’ ’ All that was wanted now was that he should give them in the prison that which had been denied them outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But since that day those prisoners who asked for bread and wine for the Memorial have not even received their letters. They are poorly clothed, have meager rations, and fifty sleep together in one room. One enamel basin, an iron comb, and a mirror about the size of an egg must suffice for the whole company. The priest had nothing left for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But we are convinced that Jehovah has not forgotten the ridicule, the bitter days, day and night with sore bodies, the blows they have received from hard fists, whippings, chains and hunger. They were not counted of more worth than an accursed animal for the slaughter. Nevertheless their sufferings were a testimony to the other prisoners and they rejoiced to hear the oral testimony and accepted the truth with gladness. And now the “day of vengeance” is being proclaimed; and who shall be the first upon whom judgment shall be executed ?—Isaiah 61: 2.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Mock Funeral Procession</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The following is a translation of an article which appeared in the German </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On Friday evening, April 3, 1936, the N.S.D.A.P. [Nazis] local organization in------arranged a prop</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">aganda procession. This parade was to call attention to the nonvoters who were known for standing on Jehovah’s side and for their nonparticipation in politics and who therefore refused to vote at the plebiscite of March 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The parade had the character of a funeral procession. The marcher’s, part of them dressed in black and high hats, walked through the streets weeping and crying and singing funeral songs. In addition there was in the procession a gravedigger with a shovel, a man with a board fastened to his forehead [an allusion to bloekheadedness], furthermore young people with torches, flanking both sides of the procession, then a horse-drawn carriage with a number of small black coffins made from cardboard. Signs were carried in that procession; two were over four yards long and bore the inscriptions: “There still are people who are looking to Jehovah for their salvation. Such people are blockheads.” The other large sign read: “Those who are not giving their allegiance to Germany, but name themselves Jehovah’s witnesses, are to us morally dead. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the parade arrived before the houses of Jehovah’s witnesses, against whom the spectacle was arranged, a trumpet signal sounded and the rabble spit out several times. Then a loud chorus called out what “crime” those followers of Christ had committed. Where one of those “criminals” owned the house a coffin was placed in front of it and left there; but where the home was only rented no coffin was left behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yet this outrage failed to have the intended effect. On the contrary, it caused much indignation amongst the order-loving people. Those coffins, conspicuously placed in front of the houses, drew large crowds that wanted to see them, and the final result was: Jehovah and His work and the faithfulness of His witnesses were brought in remembrance, even though in a strange way.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Brief Reports from Germany</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">With murder in their hearts a mob of 200 to 300 invaded the home of one of Jehovah’s witnesses on the night of the plebiscite, dragged him from his bed, struck and kicked him repeatedly, and compelled him to carry a gallows through the city, meantime shouting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let now Jehovah help you! Why does not your Jehovah help you, you traitor, you pig, you scoundrel ? Look at him. He walks along like a lamb of God. Ha, ha, ha 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When he was rescued by police officials, the mob yet attempted to hang him, but was prevented. When he arrived at the city hall, the mayor called him a rascal, and no German; that he deserved to be drowned; that he must leave town; and that he should have neither work nor relief. After two nights in detention he was released from prison. He was deprived of his position, but did not leave town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At an unnamed place a mob smashed the windows of a store but were unable to find access to the home connected with it. This mob, carrying a gallows with them of sufficient height to hang a man, milled around the building looking in vain for the living quarters. The police arrived in time to rescue the family by jailing them two days for their own safety. In this place the mayor led the mob, which shouted repeatedly, “Where is now your Jehovah? Jehovah! Ha, ha I What a nice Jehovah! He does not even help you.” “But He did, and now, with no personal injuries suffered, we have more opportunities to witness than we had before,” say the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From Saxony, Germany, comes the report that a schoolteacher asked her pupils, 'What is the greatest thing in the world?” and a ten-year-old girl rose and said, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” She was ordered to take her seat in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A verbatim report (translated) says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord is feeding us wonderfully at the present time. . . . Yesterday we finished the testimony period. In spite of all difficulties, we made special efforts this time, and the Lord has blessed us richly therein. His protection was especially manifest. Courage and determination gives us the victory; for it is written: “In nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.” The new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> on “Our Responsibility”, makes the matter fully clear for us. The Lord is manifestly leading His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is becoming increasingly difficult to communicate with the Lord’s sheep in Germany by any means whatever.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Drops Before the Shower</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">F. B. Freer, England, writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I recently sent you an item from the Manchester </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font9"> dealing with the Nazi persecutions. I was so moved by this that I wrote to the German ambassador in London, protesting against these practices and urging him to use his influence to try to stop them. My letter to him should have reached him Wednesday, April 8. On Friday morning, April 10, the ambassador dropped dead while dressing. Apparently he was quite well up to the time of this heart attack. The evening before he had seen Hitler’s envoy, Ribbentrop, off by airplane on his return to Germany.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>“Lord, Make Us Free”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Just before casting his vote for Hitler every German was ordered to interrupt whatever he was doing and sing “Lord, make us free”. The moment selected was when Hitler ascended the platform to make his closing campaign speech. The Lord of the Bible is Jehovah, the only true and the living God, and at the moment when the German people were to sing this song more than a thousand of His faithful witnesses were in Hitler’s prisons, some of them being beaten so terribly that those who saw the beatings fainted at the sight. Which ones will Jehovah hear?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Tortured by Revived Inquisition</span></h5>
<p><span class="font18">O</span><span class="font10">NE of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany sends the following harrowing report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This letter is not written with the purpose of horrifying or discouraging anyone, but only to show that Satan’s representatives in Germany are completely possessed by his fiendish spirit and how cruelly and tyrannically they torture Jehovah’s people. From the few instances which I shall report can be seen how proper it is to pray with the words of Psalm S3 for the speedy destruction of Satan’s organization. It seems that the Devil is not so much interested in killing Jehovah’s witnesses, because this would not be the worst, as, in fact, it would in many cases be release; but he is bent on torturing to the limit in order to thus cause them to give up their integrity toward God. In some cases he succeeds; but in many other cases he utterly fails. What follows are some short, truthful reports. In case you publish them, be sure not to give the names either of the persons or of the places, because otherwise the result would be sure death for these persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘ ‘ In------eight witnesses were imprisoned because</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">they did not vote, and then they were brought, together with one Communist, under heavy guard to the camp. There they were compelled to stand for three long hours at a wall, with their faces close to it, and during these hours they received blows upon the backs of their heads which made their faces dash against the wall and the blood stream from their noses. After this, one after the other, they were pushed into the registration room or “reception room”, where immediately a robust Nazi jumped at their throats and strangled them so long with his deadly grip that they were blue in their faces. After this each one’s ears were boxed about forty times. Then they had to do knee-crooking to the point of exhaustion, and at the same time their torturers flogged the backs of their knees until the victims collapsed. Then they were, if possible, forced to say: ‘I am not a witness of Jehovah; but I am a big blockhead. ’ After this all were grabbed and thrown into another room, all in a heap, and drenched with water, and then they were dragged by their feet around the floor until they had dried it up with their bodies. But this was not the end. They were each thrown into another room, where they were received by three Nazis. One of these threw a blanket over the head of the victim, who was then thrown upon a table, and the two other devils mutilated their backs with bludgeons. Two elderly witnesses today still urinate with blood because this torture has bruised their kidneys. Whenever one of the tormented fainted, he was hung up by his feet, head down, and water was poured over him until consciousness returned. When this degree of torture was survived, he was forced, though half dead, to crawl up a winding staircase, where every five meters a Nazi devil stood and again heartlessly continued to beat him. The Communist was apparently mistreated even worse than the witnesses: after the procedure he was nothing but a bloody, whimpering bundle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘ ‘ One witness was so violently kicked in the stomach that he collapsed unconscious. Hair was partly torn out, partly cut with knives or with garden shears, and this mutilation was accompanied by forty slams in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘ ‘ Four witnesses were terribly beaten at their arrival in the concentration camp. Then they were besmeared with jam, and forced to lick it off one another. After this they were .ordered to stand on a table and sing ‘ Germany, Germany above all, above all in the world, ’ and then a song of Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">[And one,—0 thou great and good God, thou Eewarder of the innocent!—after all these beatings, sang as only the Germans can sing, “Give Praise to Jehovah!”]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“One day 250 prisoners from one concentration camp were transported to another even more notorious camp. From the railroad station high up to the camp on the hill they were compelled to run, while the guards flogged them over the heads with whips. All 250 prisoners, amongst them numerous witnesses, thus received a merciless thrashing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A sister wrote to her husband, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who was kept a prisoner in the camp, and quoted the Scripture, ‘Fear not!’ During the night he was brought and ordered to read that text aloud. Then he was asked if he really only fears Jehovah. This he confirmed. The Nazis replied, ‘Then we shall teach you to fear us!’ Hereupon they gave him a terrible beating. On the whole the name of Jehovah has been exceedingly blasphemed and mocked, in spite of the warnings by the brethren.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A few days ago they arrested a witness and beat him, until his blood flowed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These few excerpts, taken from many facts which are too numerous to be mentioned, may suffice. Pray with us to Jehovah that He may annihilate these wicked hordes, to the honor of His name!</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Letters Received at the Paris Office</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">Am I right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am engaged in studying the Bible. It’s not a task without toiling, but with the publications of the Watch Tower it is getting interesting, passionate. At certain moments some truths not understood until now and suddenly revealed to me become a source of blessings which cannot be described in words, a source of life, of intense life. Blessed be the day that brought to my home your message over radio! What little knowledge I have gathered until now out of my studying induces me to alter my manner of living, to change my ways. I need your advice in order to assure me that I am not wrong, for I believe to see that I must separate myself from the Catholic church, an organization which is tied up with Satan. I realize that neither God nor Jesus has commanded to keep the “sacraments”: the sprinkling, confession, first Communion. I am therefore decided not to send my daughter to the study of the catechism and not to let her take part in the first communion. Am I right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">J., </span><span class="font9">at S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is the Truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I take the liberty of writing to you, as I have a desire to thank you for your generous, fruitful visit of last Sunday. I say fruitful visit, because it was to me, dear sir, an occasion to put some questions to you the answer of which I was anxious to receive. Since a certain time already I had intended to write to the Watch Tower asking for a visit of one of its devoted friends. My desire was stilled even before expressed and transmitted to the Watch Tower, and I believe to see in this fact a manifestation of the divine promise: ‘Before they call I will answer.’ I remember you in my prayers and wish that God may grant you to work still a long time for the spreading of a message which, I am sure of it, is the Truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Please accept once more, dear sir, the assurance of my gratitude and profound, respectful friendship.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Obedience Gives Power with God</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;As a prince hast thou power with God.&quot;—Genesis 32:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">THE WATCHTOWER</span><span class="font10"> has been running a series of remarkable articles explaining the prophetical significance of the most important events in the lives of Joseph and his brethren. Everybody should read those articles. Consideration of them led to the study on obedience which follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The subject of this sketch is Jacob, whose faithfulness to God has been discussed at length in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> on numerous occasions. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font10"> sums up the matter thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before the death of Isaac, he pronounced his blessing upon his son Jacob, and Jacob thereby became the successor of his father to the Abrahamic promise. Under the rule of descent, the firstborn or eldest son was the heir of the father’s estate and any other rights or privileges that went with that estate, unless for some cause there should be an exception to the rule. Esau, having been born a few moments before his brother Jacob, under the operation of this rule would be the successor of the Abrahamic promise and heir to his father. His birthright, therefore, would include the promise made to Abraham. But the Lord clearly indicated that there should be an exception to the rule in this ease and that Jacob should be the heir, and not Esau. When it was known that the mother would bear two sons, and just before the time of their birth, Rebekah, the mother, inquired of the Lord concerning the expected children, and the Lord said unto her that two sons would be born to her and that the elder should serve the younger. (Genesis 25:22, 23) This definitely shows that it was God’s purpose that Jacob, who was born last, should be the heir and successor to the Abrahamic promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These two sons grew to manhood’s estate. Esau became a great hunter and loved the outdoor sports; while Jacob was a plain man, remaining quietly at home. Esau showed that he did not appreciate the birthright, viz., the Abrahamic promise, even if it were his, which in fact it was not, since God had foreordained that it should belong to Jacob. Esau thought more of his own selfish, immediate comfort than any thing that might come to him by reason of this promise. On one occasion he was in the field hunting. He returned hungry and faint. He found that Jacob had prepared a pot of lentils. When Esau smelled this appetizing food he said to Jacob: “Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: . . . and Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me? And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright. ’ ’—Genesis 25:27-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Genuine, real right and title to the birthright was now Jacob’s for two good and sufficient reasons: (1) Because it was so ordered by the Lord before his birth, as above stated; and (2) because he had bought it in an open and fair transaction with his brother Esau. These two brothers were not mere children at this time. They were past forty years of age (Genesis 26:34), both capable of entering into a contract; and they made a contract which was binding upon both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Notwithstanding these two good reasons why Jacob was justly entitled to the birthright, Esau attempted to deprive him of it. The birthright carried with it the privilege of the special blessing from their father. Isaac was old and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see; and he knew that the day of his death might be near. (Genesis 27:1,2) He directed his son Esau to go into the field and take some venison and bring it to him that he might eat, and give Esau his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible does not clearly show that Isaac knew God had foreordained that this birthright should belong to Jacob, nor that he knew Esau had sold it to Jacob; therefore we can excuse the old father for thinking it was his duty to bestow his blessing upon his son Esau. Rebekah, the mother, however, knowing of both these reasons why Jacob was entitled to the birthright, knowing that Esau did not appreciate it, and knowing of his wrongful intent to deprive his brother Jacob of the privileges and blessings incident to the birthright, advised Jacob what to do in order to protect his own rightful and proper interests. The mother therefore was carrying out God’s will in this respect. She was doing what all honest persons should do: try to protect the rights and privileges of those that are near and dear to them. She therefore directed Jacob to slay two kids of the goats and bring them to her and she prepared some savory meat; and then, in order that the blind father might not obstinately refuse to aid them in carrying out the divine purposes, and in order that he might think he was blessing Esau, the mother, Rebekah. fastened upon the arms of her son Jacob the skins of the kids and also put the skins about his neck that he would appear as a hairy man like unto his brother Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jacob then came in before his father and presented the savory meat. His father kissed him and laid his hand upon him and gave to Jacob his blessing. The old father then spoke in prophetic phrase, evidently under the direction of the Lord, saying unto his son Jacob: “Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee; and blessed be he that blesseth thee.” —Genesis 27: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Almost immediately Esau returned from the field and found that Jacob had received his father’s blessing and that he (Esau) had been unsuccessful in carrying out his purpose of defeating the open and fair transaction which he had made with Jacob when he had sold his birthright. He hated his brother Jacob and determined to kill him as soon as his father Isaac was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems rather strange that many Christian people have severely criticized Jacob and his mother, Rebekah, in this transaction. It has evidently been due to the fact that they were ignorant of the record. No part of Jacob’s action in connection with the birthright is reprehensible. Everything with reference to Esau is reprehensible. God subsequently showed that Esau pictured the people of earth who are Christians in name only, but not in truth and in fact, who are hypocritical, and who persecute the true Christians; while Jaeob pictured or foreshadowed the true followers of Christ who have been misrepresented and persecuted by the merely nominal Christians. God showed his approval of the conduct of Jacob and his mother, Rebekah, and showed that it was his purpose and intention that Jacob should receive the blessing going with the birthright. Jacob had shown his great desire for the birthright, which was merely a promise; while Esau had despised it.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Jacob Was Then 77 Years Old</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Jacob was at this time 77 years of age, and was no doubt the principal support of his blind father and his mother. Esau had been married 37 years and seems to have lived at his father’s home, with his two wives, Judith and Bashe-math. Apparently these two women did not do much but primp and hang around to be waited on; anyway, they got on Rebekah’s nerves. And as for Esau, it is apparent that he was more interested in hunting and other sports than in looking out for the necessities of his father, his mother, his wives, or even himself. It will be remembered that he bartered his birthright for a mess of pottage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jacob raised the lentils; they were rightfully his. Esau came in from one of his hunting trips hungry. He did not love God; he sold out to gratify his appetite. The Bible says that “Esau was a cunning hunter”; and that is about all that can be said for him. “Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.” That means that he was on the job early and late, looking after his parents, doing what was right and proper for him to do. He was neither sex crazy nor sport crazy. He could have imitated Esau had he so desired, but he knew to desire something better. Like Abraham and Isaac before him, “heirs with him of the same promise,” “he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country”: “for he looked for a city [government] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”— Hebrews 11: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jacob’s mother made a great sacrifice. She wanted Jacob to have the blessing of God, and be the progenitor of the Savior. She urged Jacob to leave all to Esau and flee to Haran, more than four hundred miles away, on the opposite side of the Euphrates river, and he left his home and went over the Jordan river on his long journey with only his staff in his hands. (Genesis 32:10) The first night out from home Jacob slept in the open, with a rock for his pillow. He awoke hungry but full of the courage of the man of God. There is a note of pathos in this old man’s vow, that, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall [Jehovah] be my God.”—Genesis 28: 20, 21.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Jacob Was Obedient</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">Jacob was obedient, and he was a real man. He loved God and was determined to do His will at all costs, but that did not mean that he did not have in good measure all the traits that go to make up a healthy, happy, normal creature. Imperfect though he was, like all the rest of humankind, there is no harm in supposing that he was well developed mentally as well as physically. It takes some courage for a man 77 years of age to leave home and go over 400 miles on foot through a strange land, with bears and lions and other savage creatures about, and to start with nothing except a staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So one may suppose that Jacob had good perceptive faculties; that he had the ability to calculate ; that he was blessed with order, method, system and arrangement; that he had good judgment of colors; that he had a sense of harmony and melody; that he had an appreciation of the value of time; that he was good at balancing and climbing; that he could recollect localities; that he could remember and marshal facts; that he had powers of observation and a desire to see for himself; that he could measure with his eyes; that he could recollect shapes; and that he could express his ideas both to his fellow men and his Creator. A little reflection will show that Jacob had all these faculties. Reread the story of his life and see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One may be sure that Jacob had good reflective faculties; that he was able to apply cause to effect; that he was able to reason by making use of illustrations; that he could discern the motives of himself and others, and that he well discerned that it is the duty of all men to be reasonably pleasant to others. Why should anybody think he is honoring Jehovah by acting like a bear, and as if it hurt him to extend greetings to his fellows?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not difficult to believe that Jacob had good constructive faculties; that he had some mechanical ingenuity; that he had some refinement and taste; that he appreciated grandeur of the infinite; that he could copy or imitate, and that he had some wit and fun in his make-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is certain that Jacob had reasonably good governing faculties; that he had some decision, some perseverance; that he had some dignity and self-respect; that he had a decent regard for the opinions of others; that he could concentrate on one thing at a time; and that he could exercise prudence and provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was every-way proper that Jacob should have what, for want of a better term, may be called “self-preservation faculties”. He must have had some bent toward accumulation of property, some interest in food and drink, some ability to remain silent on proper occasions, some executive force, some love of life, some willingness to resist wrong and to defend right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most certainly Jacob had a good development of social faculties; he had a great love of home; he was sociable and friendly toward his fellow men; he had an interest in the opposite sex such as is natural to all; he was capable of matrimony and the regard for offspring and animals which is bound up in the brain and heart of all who are descendants of the first man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Finally, and most important of all, Jacob had a splendid development of the moral faculties. He had a sense of equity, of justice; he had hope in the goodness of God, and an expectation that kindness and goodness on his own part would not go unseen and unrewarded; and, finally, and the climax of all his mental store, he had an unswerving faith in the Most High God, and a determination to do His will in big things and in little, and to be true and steady in his love for Him though the heavens fall and the earth fade away and disappear.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>“Served Seven Years for Rachel&quot;</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The statement appears in the further story of Jacob’s life that “Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her”. (Genesis 29: 20) To understand the real meaning of this text the previous history of Jacob must be kept in mind, as well as the fact that when the seven years had expired Jacob was entering his eighty-fifth year. Unquestionably, Rachel was an attractive woman, and Jacob, even at 85, was not oblivious of that fact, but, all the time, the real, impelling motive for marrying her was the birthright and its accompanying blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Quite likely, though the account does not so state, the Lord disclosed to Jacob when Rachel first came to the well to water the sheep that this comely young woman would ultimately be the mother of Joseph, the grand prototype of Christ Jesus, the Savior of the world, in whom all the families of the earth shall be blessed. Jacob thus pictured Jehovah God; and Rachel, God’s woman, Zion, whom He loves most dearly because she is the mother of the Promised Seed. The kiss which Jacob gave Rachel upon meeting her was the kiss of a near kinsman, not of a lover. It was not the delusion of “love [passion] at first sight”.—Genesis 29:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All are familiar with the story of how Laban substituted the forty-year-old Leah for Rachel on the wedding night. That Leah was 45 when Jacob was 89 seems quite clear from Genesis 30:9; and so she was 40 when married. She did bear some children subsequently, and this is not unusual for those who have “left bearing” if the preceding years were largely childless ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rachel seems to have been about eleven years younger than Leah. Her last child, Benjamin, was born when Jacob was 105 or more. If she was 50 then, she was 22 when Jacob first saw her at the well, and as that is the mating age, it is no wonder that Jacob viewed her with interest, hope and expectation that through her would come the answer to the tremendous promises which God had made to him the night when he slept on the stone pillow at Bethel.—Genesis 28:11-15.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>The Promises of God</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set: and he took </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9"> the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, [Jehovah] stood above it, and said, I am [Jehovah the] God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">; and</span><span class="font9"> thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

<h6><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>A Table of Events</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">The following is a table of events in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, arranged to show at what times in the lives of each certain of the things of interest to the people of God occurred. It is known from his own statement that Jacob was 130 years of age at the same time that Joseph was 39; that interesting young man first saw the light of day, therefore, when his father was 91 years of age—the fourteenth year of Jacob’s service of Laban. The deduction that Benjamin was born when Jacob was 105 or more, and not when he was 98, is derived from the record of building operations at Succoth (Genesis 33:17), of the sojourn at Shalem which followed, and of the subsequent one at Luz (Genesis 35) before Benjamin’s birth.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>To the Faithful in All the Earth</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">THE testimony period beginning March 27 is designated “Faithful Warrior”. All persons now on the earth and who are devoted to Jehovah God are on the side of Christ Jesus, His “Faithful Warrior”. Such persons are known as the remnant and the Jonadabs. The command of Jehovah to them is: “Arise ye . . . against her in battle.” Christ Jesus, the Faithful Warrior, is now engaged in making war on organized religion known as “Babylon”, the Devil’s organization, that deceives the people and fights against God. That is God’s “strange work”, because it exposes the hypocrisy and duplicity of those who have used the name of God and Christ to deceive the people and turn them away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every person now on the earth and who is on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom is privileged to feed at the Lord’s table and to learn of the unfolding of prophecy, which is meat in due season for him, and which is provided by the Lord for his comfort and hope. Every one of such is duty-bound to obey God’s commandments, and those who have opportunity to obey and who fail or refuse will suffer the consequences. (Acts 3:23) To obey the Lord’s commandments everyone who is on the side of the Lord must now fearlessly bear testimony against the enemy and to the name and praise of Jehovah and His kingdom. This letter is merely a reminder, dear brethren, of your privilege and obligation. If you would maintain your integrity toward Jehovah you will joyfully obey His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Special periods for giving testimony are fixed in order that all of God’s people throughout the earth may, at the same time, send up a shout to the honor of His holy name. The “Faithful Warrior” testimony period should see every one of the faithful in the field presenting the message of the Lord to the people. This you will do by the use of the transcription machine, and the phonograph, and by presenting to the people the printed message. A special combination of books is made available for this testimony period. Let everyone place as many combinations as possible in the hands of the people. Jehovah’s “warning” must he given to those who claim to be Christians. (Ezekiel 33: 7-9) The message of the Kingdom and the name of Jehovah must be proclaimed to all nations as a witness. Do not concern yourself about who will and who will not die at Armageddon, but concern yourself about your own duty to deliver the message as God commands. The Lord will take care of the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That part of the war which is the “strange work” is now on. Will you perform your part therein in obedience to God’s commandment? That work will be completed in due time, and then follows “his strange act”. Be alert and be diligent in this day of conflict between wickedness and righteousness. May the Father of mercies and God of all comfort continue to strengthen and bless you.</span></p>

As you have probably noticed, there’s no commercial advertising in this magazine; so every one of its 32 pages contains something that you want to read. That means that in a year’s time, if all of its 26 issues were put together it would make a volume of over 800 pages.

<p><span class="font10">All those people who love righteousness and desire to do Jehovah’s will will want to have a share in the proclamation of the Kingdom message. Throughout the world, in approximately 80 nations, countries and islands of the sea, the 'faithful in all the earth’ will go forward as one army on the side of Jehovah God’s Faithful Warrior, Christ Jesus. Will you be one of them? Do you wish to have a share in the proclamation of the best news that can be brought to the people, which news is the Kingdom, the hope of the world? Are you associated with Jehovah’s witnesses ? If not, do you want to be? Maybe you are in a small village, or off in the “sticks”, and you can’t meet with a group of Jehovah’s witnesses but still you may want to distribute the literature that will bring comfort and aid to the peoples of earth. For your convenience, therefore, a special offer is set out below whereby you can share in the distribution of the literature. Six of these booklets can be offered on a contribution of 25c, and in this manner those persons obtaining the literature can share in making it possible to print more. Please make report to the Society of the distribution you make during this particular period, March 27-April 4 inclusive. The Society will be pleased to hear from you and give you such information as is necessary to join the ‘faithful in all the earth’ in this mighty proclamation concerning Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
