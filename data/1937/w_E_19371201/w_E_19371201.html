<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 7</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH’S judgment day is a time of first cleansing his sanctuary and then destroying everything that is an abomination in his sight. Jehovah’s judgment is carried forward by and through his Chief Officer, Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has installed at his temple for the purpose of judgment. (Mal. 3:1-3) The time of judgment is from 1918 onward. The time and manner of judgment is definitely fixed, as stated in the Scriptures: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely l:e saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?” (1 Pet. 4:17,18) The execution of Jehovah’s judgment against the wrongdoers begins witli those who have taken the name of God in vain, proving unfaithful and against God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* The organized religion falsely and wrongfully called ‘ ‘ Christianity ’ ’, or ‘ ‘ the Christian religion ’ ’, has taken the name of God and Christ Jesus, and that great combined religious system is headed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That religious institution has presumptuously assumed the name of God and falsely claims to be the direct representative of God and Christ on earth, and yet every part of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy institution is hypocritical. The Hierarchy has brought greater reproach upon the name of Jehovah than any other institution that has existed on the earth. It has carried on the most flagrant and cruel and vicious racket of any criminal institution that ever existed. This is particularly true because that institution has practiced a great fraud upon the people in the name of God and of Christ, deceiving them and robbing them of their property and destroying their opportunity for life everlasting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Where, then, should it be expected that evil or adverse judgment will begin? The Lord God, through his prophet Jeremiah, answers that question specifically: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. ’ ’—Jer. 25: 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">* The Roman Catholic Hierarchy in particular, and all the so-called “Christian” religionists in general, for centuries have induced billions of persons to believe that such religious institutions represent God and Christ, and those billions of people have gladly followed the hypocritical and blasphemous leaders. Because the religious leaders have boldly claimed that they represent God and Christ, and because they have exhibited the greatest amount of hypocrisy, millions of honest men have rejected God and the Bible, his Word, and Christ Jesus, the Savior, and have reproached God for apparently having such an organization of hypocrites on earth to represent him. Seeing the hypocrisy of the clergy, which particularly was exhibited during the World War, millions of young men, as well as older ones, have turned entirely against God and anything that pertains to him and his kingdom. The religious leaden by their false doctrines and their wrongful and immoral conduct have made God to appear as a fiend and as a party to their crimes. They have collected money upon their announced claim that God would hear their prayers and forgive cruel and wicked crimes and criminals. The honest men have said: ‘We want nothing to do with such a God, who is a party to such wickedness’; and thus the religionists have greatly reproached the name of God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> The word “evil”, as used in the text above quoted from Jeremiah, means a calamity befalling a creature or organization for wrongdoing. It is written that Jehovah creates evil. (Isa. 45:7) That means that Jehovah has provided for the punishment of wrongdoers by sending upon those wrongdoers a calamity. That calamity is an evil or a punishment to the wrongdoers. Now Jehovah definitely and plainly states: “I begin to bring evil [calamity] [at or] on the city upon which my name is called.”—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Margin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> God’s judgment upon the new Jerusalem, that is, upon the faithful remnant on earth, brings no evil upon them, because he approves them and clothes that faithful company with the robe of his righteousness that they may offer unto him an offering in righteousness; and hence he puts his name of approval upon</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">them. (Mal. 3:3; Isa. 61:10) But there is an organization which calls itself by the name of the Lord, that is, the so-called ‘ ‘ Christian religion ’ ’, which religion is claimed to worship God and Christ but does not. ‘Upon that city [organization]says Jehovah, ‘ “upon which my name is called,” but which is unfaithful to me,’ he begins the evil. God puts his curse, that is, his expressed wrath, upon or against that organization. The clear distinction is made between the true followers of Christ Jesus and those who practice religion in the name of Christ. Even the faithful ones of God were partially “drunken” and were unwillingly guilty of much deflection before the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, and this was due to their ignorance and to the ignorance that had been forced upon them by the religious systems, out of which they came. They were honest of heart and truly endeavored to do God’s will as well as they knew, and upon the coming of the Lord to the temple for judgment they were cleansed; and concerning such it is written: “And there shall be no more curse [on the faithful remnant for being negligent]': but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants [those of the 'elect servant’ class] shall serve him.”—Rev. 22: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’ The organization that has presumptuously assumed the name of God and Christ and brought great reproach upon that name and continued to do so is exactly in a contrary position. Upon that unfaithful crowd God inflicts full punishment, and that punishment is the beginning of Armageddon, and hence the beginning of God’s “act, his strange act”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• To the religionists who hang on to what they call the “Christian religion”, whether they be of the laity that go to church and indulge in certain religious forms and ceremonies or arc non-professors of religion but who think the church organizations arc necessarily a part of the governments and must be tolerated for that reason, all these the Lord includes when he says: “Should ye be utterly unpunished!” Otherwise stated, the Lord’s words arc: 'Are you guiltless with respect to the organized religion and religionists who practice in my name? Have you not also reproached Jehovah’s name?’ Such persons have joined with the leaders of religion in persecuting God’s faithful servants, upon whom the Lord has truly put his name, and thus they have added further insult to injury. They join in the persecution of such faithful ones to reproach God’s name out of malice, and because they hate God and righteousness and hate anything that pertains to him and his organization. Have not such persons in the past acted, and do they not continue in the present to act in conjunction with the hypocritical leaders, that is, the clergy, in doing violence to God’s people, and in reproaching his name? Such persons have received the warning from God’s Word, which has been delivered to them by his witnesses, and they have shown themselves to be of the “goat” class, by joining the religionists in the persecution of God’s faithful witnesses. Those persons have no regard for what is right and just. They operate with the religious leaders and do so for political and commercial gain; and so with the fall of the religious systems those men will be next in order upon whom tne wrath of God will be executed. The Scriptures therefore clearly show that at first the clergy and like hypocrites receive punishment and then their supporters suffer a like punishment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> The so-called “Christian religion” will be no protection to any creature or nation when Armageddon begins. To those who claim such protection the Lord says: “Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.” Christ Jesus, the great Sword or Executioner, will quickly and promptly respond to the call of Jehovah and will move into action against all that are a part of or supporters of the Devil’s organization; and concerning this it is written: “And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at case; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.” (Zcch. 1:15) “For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recompenccs for the controversy of Zion.” (Isa. 34:2,3,8) By these scriptures it is seen that Jehovah’s record of prophecy is really history in advance by which he advises those who serve him what they may expect to come to pass in the near future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Having expressed his determination to visit his calamity or punishment upon all the nations of the world, Jehovah then gives Jeremiah positive command to tell the people about it: “Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.”— Jcr. 25:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> Here Jeremiah pictures Jehovah’s remnant as a whole, and each one thereof; and upon each one rests a like responsibility. All who will be faithful unto God and prove their integrity toward him will quickly and gladly obey this commandment. No one can obey this commandment by substituting some other person for himself. It is an individual responsibility. It is an opportunity for each one to prove his devotion to Jehovah. Some may be incapacitated physically or otherwise as to going from house to house, but such will avail themselves of every possible opportunity that comes their way to get the message to others. One’s responsibility is in proportion to his opportunity. Some are concerned with preparing the material for the field workers, and in doing this they thereby share in the service of the Lord. All of Jehovah’s faithful people are now to be at unity in making known Jehovah ’s purpose upon the nations of the earth, and each one performing his assigned duty is having part in the service, whether he be in the office, in the factory, or in the field, or preparing food for others. God’s people must now be wholly and completely devoted to him and his cause, and be blind to everything else. The Jonadabs will remain in the city of refuge and show their devotion and faithfulness to God by joining in the proclamation of the message of the kingdom as opportunity is afforded them. It is now war time, and the witnesses of the Lord must now be engaged in that war, and their part therein is singing the praises of Jehovah and his King; and that song of praise sung in full confidence to the Lord strikes terror to the heart of the enemy. The Lord’s invisible forces will do the inflicting of the mortal punishment.—2 Chron. 20:15-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup> The Scriptures indicate that the enemy may for a time put to silence the earths witnesses. The purpose of the enemy now is to rid the earth of Jehovah’s witnesses and the message which they bring from the Lord. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her allies, when gaining control of all the nations of “Christendom”, almost certainly will clamp down on the witness work. That is exactly what the Devil’s organization has done recently in Germany. Then the religious crowd will felicitate one another and say: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘ Peace</span><span class="font2"> and safety; now we have everything our own way.’ Then the Lord acts; as it is written: ‘Sudden destruction shall come upon them, and they shall find no way to escape.’ (1 Thess. 5:3) Says the prophet: “The Lord shall roar from on high”; that is, from the top of his universal organization, because he is the Supreme Power, the Most High. Jehovah’s roar will be most terrible and appalling to the enemy and will drown out everything else and fill the ranks of the enemy with dismay. Jehovah, in righteous indignation, goes into battle action by his chief representative, Christ Jesus, who takes the lead of the heavenly host to completely crush out the enemy. “The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy [zeal, great heat of battle] like a man of war; he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. I [Jehovah] have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself; now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.”—Isa. 42:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> Zion is the habitation of Jehovah. It is his capital organization, chosen for himself. (Ps. 132:13) Jehovah shall “utter his voice from his holy habitation”. (Jer. 25:30) This he does by proxy through Christ Jesus, his great Judge, who is now at the temple. He utters his voiee by his Logos, the Head of the capital organization. He does not utter his voice from “the city which is called by my name”, for the reason that that city or organization is unholy and has been spued out of the Lord’s mouth. God is against the unholy organization of “Christendom”, and it is against that organization he begins his “strange act”; and he begins that “strange act” by Christ Jesus, who utters the voice of Jehovah. “Christendom” is entirely of the earth, being completely removed from things spiritual. It is written: ‘At his voice the earth melted.’ (Ps. 46:6) That will be the effect upon the religious systems. They shall melt and pass away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> “He shall mightily roar upon his habitation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[na-vah</span><span class="font2"> (Hebrew), meaning, ‘at home’; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham) </span><span class="font2">over his home].” “Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[na-vah </span><span class="font2">(Hebrew): home].” (Ex. 15:13) Jehovah thus manifests himself as being on the side of his faithful people, that is, the temple company, wherein he resides and rests by his spirit. ‘ ‘ For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.” (2 Cor. 6:16) His roar shall be against his enemies, and not against his own people, but shall be through them,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> That will be the time of his triumph, and “he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes ’ ’; that is, a shout of joy and vindication. The treaders of grapes make wine, which is of good cheer; but, on the occasion of treading, Jehovah by Christ Jesus treads out the blood of Satan’s “vine of the earth”. (Rev. 14:18-20) Such is the time of destruction to the enemy, and the time of vindication and joy to the Lord. The treading begins at “Christendom”, but does not stop until it embraces or takes in all the enemy. The treading is “against all the inhabitants of the earth”, and therefore all must be trodden in “the great winepress of the wrath of God”. “And he [Jehovah’s Word, Christ Jesus] treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.” (Rev. 19:15) “I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people [all the inhabitants of the earth] there was none with me; for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.”—Isa. 63: 3, 4, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> Desolation usually causes a tumultuous noise, and so Armageddon is described as such: “A noise </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[(Leeser) A</span><span class="font2"> tumultuous noise] shall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 25: 31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">” A tumultuous noise, which accompanies the battle of Armageddon, betokens wasting, destruction, and desolation. Furthermore the Lord, by his prophet, says concerning his wrath expressed against the nations of earth: “Because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">noise of their voice is uttered: because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken; every one of their bows is broken; for the Lord God of rccompenccs shall surely requite.”—Jer. 51: 55, 56.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> That great and terrible destruction begins on the religious system and extends </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">all nations; and this ij further shown by the following prophecy, to wit: “But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth [Moabite city] ; and Moab shall die with tumult [a great noise], with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.” (Amos 2: 2) The hypocritical organization called “Christendom” shall be first, and this is shown by </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">following prophecy: “Therefore shall a tumult </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">arise </span><span class="font2">among thy [‘Christendom’s’] people, and all </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thy </span><span class="font2">fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">pieces upon her children. ’ ’—Hos. 10:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> These scriptures show conclusively that the old “whore” must go down first. Relating to the same thing, says the prophet Isaiah: “ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font2"> voice of noise from the city [unfaithful ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized religion’], a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recoin ponce to hiscneinies.” (Isa. 66:6) Mark the clear distinction here between the voice of noise from “Christendom” and the voice of the Lori. The voice of the Lord is beau&gt;’ful and harmonious and it is his voice from the tcm.de that tills'unfaithful “Christendom”, or organized religionists, with dismay, and the latter makes a great noise of confusion and tumult. The noise that begins at “Christendom”, a noise because of destruction, will go around the entire earth, with no nation being omitted, and it “shall come”, as Jeremiah states, “even to the ends of the earth.” The voice of the Lord from the temple is now being proclaimed and strikes dismay into “Christendom”, and this comes in fulfillment of his commandment: ‘This gospel of the kingdom must be preached to nil the nations as a witness’; then comes the end in the great tribulation. (Matt. 24:14,21) The nations that are warned shall feel to the fullest extent the wrath of Almighty God. Comparatively only a few of earth’s population have heard, believed and given heed to the warning message of the Lord. Few have faith; and those who have no faith and who are in “Christendom” are in that condition largely because the clergy, the Devil’s agents, have destroyed their faith. In harmony with this the apostle quotes from the prophet: “But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report [ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(margin) </span><span class="font2">believed the hearing of us] ? So then faith comcth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.”—Rom. 10:16-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> The reason is assigned for this great tumultuous noise that accompanies the calamity, to wit: ‘ ‘ For the Lord hath a controversy with the nations.” The Hebrew word here for the word “controversy” is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rib, </span><span class="font2">and in other places is rendered “plead”. In the following texts it is rendered: “Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel; for the Lord hath a controversy [ (Hebrew) rib] with the inhabitants of the land [of ‘Christendom’].” (Hos. 4:1) “For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recom-pcnces for the controversy [rib (Hebrew)] of [in behalf of] Zion.”—Isa. 34: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> Further describing Armageddon, Jeremiah says: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together, and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead [(Hebrew) rib] their cause, that he may give rest to the land [of his faithful witnesses on the earth], and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.” (Jcr. 50:33-35) “Arise, 0 God, plead [(Hebrew) rib] thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproachcth thee daily. Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee incrcaseth continually.”—Ps. 74:22,23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>22</sup> The na'ions of earth, ai d particularly of ‘ Christendom”, ha\e scorn'd the message of Jehovah and ha.'e ill-treated his witnesses, whom Jehovah sent to deliver his messages ; and for that reason the controversy is forced. The clergy of “Christendom” have raised the questions: “Who is Jehovah? Is his message true, or even worth listening to? Who gives these so-called witnesses authority to speak?” Jehovah will convince that proud and scornful crowd of hypocrites, and they shall know that it is Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>23</sup> Now the nations are gathered before the Lord for judgment, and none are passed by unnoticed. Christ Jesus, acting for Jehovah, hears the cause and renders judgment. Concerning this the prophet Jeremiah says: “He will plead with [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shaphat;</span><span class="font2"> that is, judge and pronounce sentence, to punish, or to avenge] all flesh.” (Jcr. 25:31) The text is otherwise rendered: “Himself hath entered into judgment with all flesh.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> Again: “He holdeth judgment over all flesh.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Lcescr)</span><span class="font2"> The pleading then will not be printed or written documents, setting out the issue, nor will it be by word of mouth, but will be the application of the facts to the law, and the execution of the decision rendered, and which is otherwise called God’s “act, his strange act”, or “sword” of execution. “For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.” (Isa. 66:16) The “sword” will begin with religionists and extend to the utmost ends of Satan’s visible and invisible organization. “And I will call for a sword against him [Gog] ; . . . And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.”-—Ezek. 38:21-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> All the lawless ones shall perish; as it is written : “He will give them that are wicked [lawless </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Hoth.)] </span><span class="font2">to the sword, saith the Lord” (Jer. 25: 31): the “evil servant” class, all religious hypocrites, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy crowd, who have so cruelly persecuted Jehovah's witnesses. This will particularly apply to the wicked agents of the Hierarchy operating in Germany, New Jersey and all other parts of the earth who have so openly shown themselves to be “goats”, working against Jehovah’s witnesses. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have been wanton and not only have scorned the message of warning but have willfully and wickedly persisted in persecuting God’s faithful ones who have carried the message of truth to them. The Hierarchy has no excuse and will find no way of escape. It is written concerning the Lord Jesus, the Executive Officer of Jehovah: “For he bearcth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” (Rom. 33:4) Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to God’s commandment and for the good of those to whom they have been sent, have carried the message to the people and the clergy of the Hierarchy, and the Hierarchy have refused to hear and have prevented many people from hearing. With malice the clergy have persecuted Jehovah’s messengers. All their wicked deeds the Lord counts as done unto hirnsclf; and the Lord Jesus, the great Judge, says concerning them, those on his left hand of his throne of judgment: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels [Gog and all of his crowd].” “And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [cutting off].” —Matt. 25: 41, 46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>25</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy have had ample warning of Jehovah’s purpose. Although they claim to be the custodians of the Word of God, and the interpreters thereof, they ignore Jehovah’s Word of warning and continue to scornfully rule over the Catholic population and to browbeat and coerce many others. Some of the Hierarchy’s hired agents will read what is here said ; and those reading, let them take warning. You have been wanted, and therefore cannot plead ignorance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> Jeremiah spoke first to Judah and Jerusalem, and his words apply first to the unfaithful so-called “religionists” who practice what they call “the Christian religion” in the name of Christ Jesus, and which religious organization is headed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Through his prophet Jehovah now speaks to them and says: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil [calamity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)]</span><span class="font2"> shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.”—Jer. 25:32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>27</sup> That calamity is the righteous judgment of Jehovah God executed with a vengeance and to the vindication of his holy name. Jehovah creates such evil or calamity, that is, he brings it upon those who merit punishment. (Isa. 45:7) That punishment will begin with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and will then extend to all other visible parts of Satan’s organization, taking in the numerous governments or nations and the parts thereof, to wit, the political, commercial, military and industrial systems of the world, and which arc pictured in “all the nations” to which Jeremiah, at the command of the Lord God, handed the cup of His fury. The nations will then begin to crumble and fall, and from one to the other the calamity will pass on until all earthly things of Satan's crowd shall perish. The last “nation” to which the calamity comes, as God through his prophet declares, is Sheshach. “The king of Sheshach shall drink after them.” (Verse 26) This includes all of Satan’s organization invisible to the human eyes, that is, Gog, and all the angels of wickedness in the “land of Magog”, and thereafter Satan himself. First seeing his power and his supporters gone, he then must drink the cup of calamity. “And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air [things invisible; that is, Satan and his wicked angelic crowd] ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.”—Rev. 16:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> By the Lord’s grace his people, in convention assembled at stated times, have publicly proclaimed the message by adopting and distributing Resolutions, and the last one of these was in 1928 and was labeled “A Declaration Against Satan and for Jehovah”. Jehovah directs his people, who arc faithful to him; and to him is given all the glory and honor. (Prov. 3: 5, 6) Without a doubt Jehovah directed the Resolution above mentioned, against the king of Sheshach, the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>22</sup> Continuing the description of the terrible battle of Armageddon, which will be a victorious fight by the Lord Jesus Christ and his armies, Jehovah, by his prophet, says: “And a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts [the uttermost parts (Zf.V.)] of the earth.” That terrible storm comes from beyond the utmost parts of Satan’s organization on earth, and therefore it is not Satan’s judgment but is raised up and comes from Jehovah God, by his Executive Officer, Christ Jesus. It is God’s storm, which wrecks Satan’s organization completely. Jehovah has recorded in his Word prayers suitable for his faithful servants to utter unto him, and this for the manifest purpose of showing what is God’s will and purpose concerning </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the enemy, and the proper course for his servants to take.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>80</sup> The eighty-third Psalm records a conspiracy formed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy with other members of the Devil’s crowd and in which conspiracy all of “Christendom” participates. The prayer of the psalmist shows the purpose of Jehovah; as it is written: “So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, 0 Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83:15-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>88</sup> The religionists are particularly reprehensible because they have the Word of God and might know its meaning if they would hear and obey the Most High. They claim to be servants of God, but have not served him, but, on the contrary, have served the Devil, and for that reason they are wicked or lawless, and of them the prophet says: “Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.” (Jer. 23:19) “Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind [that is, a cutting whirlwind </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(marijin)]</span><span class="font2"> ; it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.”— Jer. 30:23, 24.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">EFFECT OF ARMAGEDDON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>82</sup> Jehovah has caused a number of his prophets to announce his purpose to clear the earth of all wickedness at the battle of Armageddon. This is not a symbolic, but a real cleansing. Why has Jehovah repeated this fact by several of his prophets and so many different times? Manifestly for the purpose of thoroughly impressing the fact upon those who would hear, that they may know and understand that it is Jehovah’s act. Human creatures are so inclined to forget, and God prevents man from having any excuse to plead ignorance. The destruction at Armageddon is not the vengeance of any one class of individuals expressed against another class. Armageddon is the battle of the Lord God Almighty, with Christ Jesus as the Field Marshal leading that fight to complete victory, and the slaughter will be so great that all will be convinced that it came from the Lord. “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. ’ ’—Jer. 25: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>88</sup> Nor does the Lord leave any doubt as to where the slaughter will begin. As Jeremiah was directed first to present the cup to the people that pretends to be the Lord’s servants, that is, “Christendom,” even so the slaughter begins upon “Christendom”, and particularly upon its leaders and chief ones, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. In corroboration of this another prophet of Jehovah records: “And begin at my sanctuary,” my professed people; that is, organized religion, called “the Christian religion”. “Then they began at the ancient men [the high ones in the religious organization, the clergy and other so-called ‘dignitaries’] which were before the house [worshiping the sun toward the east]. And he said unto them, Defile [with blood] the house, and fill the courts with the slain; go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city [‘Christendom’].”—Ezek. 9:6,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>84</sup> The slain will not be just a few, but, as God by his prophet says, “the slain of the Lord shall lie many.” (Isa. 66:16) During the World War the slaying was confined chiefly to Europe and Asia Minor; but when Armageddon begins and progresses, the slaying will be not only in “Christendom”, but, as stated by the Lord, “from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth.” (Jer. 25:33) It will necessarily include all the nations of the world, which arc upon the face of the earth (vs. 26), because such shall drink of the cup of this fury, as the Lord declares. The great deluge or flood in the time of Noah was a picture of the destruction that shall come at Armageddon; and the destruction in the flood wac world-wide, and so shall it be at Armageddon. Jesus must have had this fact in mind when he said: “But as the days of No'e were, so shall also the coming [parousia] of the Son of man be. . . . The flood came, and took them all away: -o shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”—Matt. 24:37-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>85</sup> Weeping for the destruction of the wicked is now and always will be out of order. “They shall not be lamented”; because that is Jehovah’s commandment to the anointed people and to those of good will, who alone will survive that day of slaughter. It is the will of God that those who arc on his side and fully devoted to him shall pray for the destruction of the wicked who oppose Jehovah and his kingdom; and the slaying of such wicked ones, instead of being a cause for lamentation on the part of God’s faithful ones, will be a cause of joy, because such sec the vindication of Jehovah’s name and his word. To the faithful ones it will be as meat or spiritual food; and such is pictured by the birds and animals of prey that come and feed upon the slaughtered ones. (Ezek. 39:17-20; Rev. 19:17-21) Nor will there be any hired mourners at the funerals, for the reason that there will be no funerals and none to hire to do the weeping. The prophet of Jehovah says concerning the slain that “they shall ... be ... neither gathered, nor buried” ; not merely because the slain will be of such numbers that to bury them would be impossible, but also, and that chiefly, because they are not w’orthy of a decent burial; and they shall not be accorded one. The survivors will be few, compared with the number of the slain, and they shall not defile themselves by providing a burial for the wicked. It is Jehovah’s express will that the Devil’s crowd shall be further and completely reproached by not having a decent and honorable burial.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">“ God will duly recompense them and, as is stated in his Word, they will get ‘like for like’ for what they have given the faithful servants of Jehovah. In 1918 in particular not only were God’s faithful people in the world, and the work in Jehovah’s name, killed, but they were not permitted to have a decent burial; as symbolically stated in the Scriptures: “And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.”—Rev. 11:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">” The dead bodies of the wicked slain at Armageddon shall be left exposed to putrefaction and be devoured by carrion birds and beasts in retaliation for mankind’s terrible violation of “the everlasting covenant”, which forbids the willful slaughtering of animals for selfish gain or pleasure. (Gen. 9:1-6) The wild beasts of the jungles have been hunted and slaughtered for no good reason whatsoever and without any excuse, and those who have cruelly violated the everlasting covenant by so slaughtering shall die, and their bodies, like those of the other wicked, “shall be dung upon the face of the ground.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(H.V.)</span><span class="font2"> That will be a crushing humiliation upon Satan’s selfglorified organization. Nimrod, who began the practice of religion at the instance of the Devil, was given an exalted place and honor amongst men because he was a slayer of wild beasts in violation of God’s covenant. Others since have tried to follow his example. God, in the exercise of his “strange act”, will express his indignation against all who have followed Nimrod’s course and who have ‘defiled the earth by breaking the everlasting covenant’. (Isa. 24:5) “For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. Their slain also shall be cast out [not buried], and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.”—Isa. 34: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Jezebel was a type of the Devil’s organization, while Ahab pictures Satan, the husband; and what befell those two foreshadows what shall come to pass upon Satan’s organization and those who form it. It was written concerning Jezebel (and antitypically applies to Satan’s crowd): “The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jczrcel. Him that dicth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dicth in the field shall the fowls of the air cat.” (1 Ki. 21:23, 24) “And the earcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jczrecl; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.” (2 Ki. 9:37; Ps. 83: 9,10) The religionists of “ Christendom ” have grossly sinned against God and shall pay the penalty; as it is written: “And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. ’ ’—Zeph. 1:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>39</sup> The “shepherds” are the clergy, who claim to shepherd the flocks or their respective congregations. These shepherds could not howl after they arc dead; and therefore they howl now, because God has decreed they shall howl: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.”—Jer. 25: 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>40</sup> The howl here mentioned does not come from the pagan clergy, but comes from the clergy and “elective elder” class of “Christendom” and who call themselves the leaders and shepherds of the flock, and to whom Jehovah refers also as those who have assumed to use his name. They were foreshadowed by the Jew i ;h eecleciastical crowd of hypocrites who practiced the Jews’ religion. For some time now the clergy have been howling and importuning selfish politicians and commercial men to help them to make a great fuss and to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from telling the truth about them. The clergymen howl because the truth of God’s Word now proclaimed exposes them and puts them in the class where they properly belong, that is, of fraudulent hypocrites, and becair e truth is sweeping away the refuge of lies behind which they hide. Thcj' will not attempt to publicly defend tinij lies, because they well know they have no defence; and therefore they choose to howl against God’s message and to say His witnesses arc bigots and should be silenced, because the message, say they, “shocks our religious susceptibilities.” They induce the politicians and courts of some jurisdictions to say: “The truth, as proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses, is subversive and seditious.” The clergy made similar charges against Christ Jesus and the apostles, and it is to be expected that the clergy of the present time will likewise accuse the faithful followers of Jesus. Jehovah says they will howl, and he is seeing to it now that they do howl.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> For years those shepherds or so-called “clergymen” of the Catholic Hierarchy and other religious practitioners have been blind (and they arc still blind) to everything except their own selfish gain, and therefore Jehovah says of them: “His watchmen [that is, the pretended and unfaithful shepherds] are blind; they arc all ignorant, they arc all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they arc greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.”—Isa. 56:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>42</sup> Jehovah now commands his witnesses to rise up with others of his great organization and give battle to the wicked organization of Satan; and this work proceeds, and the hypocrisy of the religionists is exposed and the people are to be made acquainted with the coming of the “strange act” of Jehovah. The clergy howl still more because of the proclamation of this message, and when Armageddon begins their howl will reach its climax.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>43</sup> Howling and in great mental agony, the shepherds wallow themselves in the dust. In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font2"> of the text the words “in the ashes” are supplied, and therefore </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham’s</span><span class="font2"> rendering of the text is correct: “And roll in the dust, ye illustrious [ones] of the flock”; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font2"> “ye leaders of the flocks”. Those once arrogant and proud-crowing roosters, who have posed as noble persons, are like the ones described by the prophet in these words: “But their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord.” (Neh. 3:5) For many years now the clergy class have posed before the peoples as noblemen and as men endowed with authority and powers to bring to them spiritual nourishment, but at the present time they arc devoid of truth and they have no spiritual nourishment from the Lord; and they arc thus described by the prophet, to wit: “Judah moumeth, and the gates thereof languish; they arc black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.” (Jcr. 14: 2, 3) After the old “whore” is burned, then those who have materially profited by associating with her will set np a great howl.—Rev. 18:8-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>44</sup> Speaking of what will come to pass, as though it already had come to pass, the Lord says, according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font2"> of this text (Jer. 25: 34), that the howl is general for the reason “the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions arc fully come”. “For your days for slaughter are fully, come, and I will break you in pieces.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(E.R.V.,</span><span class="font2"> margin) “Because your days for being slaughtered arc fulfilled, therefore will I break you in pieces.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font2"> Their slaughter and dispersion will be done by the “six men” symbolically described by Jehovah’s prophet, each one of which wielded “a weapon of his breaking in pieces” in his hand. (Ezck. 9:2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font2"> The “six men” picture Christ and his army invisible to human eyes. To Christ Jesus Jehovah says concerning the enemy nations: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (Ps. 2:9) “The Lord of hosts is his name. Thou [Christ] art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms. I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. And I will render unto Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 51:19,20,23,24) Here it is expressly stated that God brings this calamity upon the religionists and their supporters as a recompense for what they have dene against him and his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>43</sup> Then the prophet of the Lord describes how these religious leaders will fall. (Jer. 25:34) A “pleasant vessel” is one much desired by selfish creatures who use such things for selfish purposes or personal gain. According to the Hebrew this part of the prophecy says: “Ye shall fall like a vessel of desire.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin) </span><span class="font2">Satan is now using many “vessels” which are willingly used for his purpose and which he desires for his purpose, and at the beginning of Armageddon he will see these vessels fall and be crushed, and this before he is cast into the pit. For years Satan has kept some of his “vessels” in positions where they claim to represent God and Christ Jesus. Those clergymen occupying such positions have posed as God’s representatives, while at the same time doing exactly contrary to God’s Word because they believed not the truth. Jehovah has permitted them to have plenty of rope to go on in their hypocritical and wicked course, and thus he has “endured [them] with much long-suffering” as “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction”. (Rom. 9: 22) That day of execution is near at hand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">NO ESCAPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>48</sup> For many years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen have assumed the office of shepherds of the various flocks, and have told the flocks that they were Christians, but who in fact have been merely practitioners of religion. The clergy have been able to keep the dupes of their flocks entirely blind to the truth, because the clergymen have taken refuge behind a great pile of lies. They have become very bold, arrogant and reckless, and they have said and continue to say amongst themselves: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” (Isa. 28:15) They have assumed the position of stability, and hold that they arc invulneiablc. But Jehovah now says to them, through his prophet: “And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Jcr. 25: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>41</sup> With the beginning of Armageddon the shepherds will find that their avenue of escape is closed: “Then shall place of refuge vanish from the shepherds.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> “And lost shall be the place of refuge for the shepherds.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font2"> Why shall their refuge disappear and their way of escape be gone? God has decreed that his hail (hard and unbreakable truths) shall sweep away the refuge of lies behind which the Roman Catholic and other clergy have found refuge; and when their lies are swept away, those shepherds will have no place to hide themselves and no refuge to which they can flee. God’s “strange work”, when finished, will have completely exposed them. Then they cannot take refuge with the “ten horns” of the “beast” on which the old “whore” rides, because those “horns”, that is, the ruling force, will turn upon and rend the old “whore”; and those clergymen who survive for a time, later to be destroyed, will not be able to find any refuge anywhere by reason of the fact that they have been clergymen. On the contrary, they will attempt to hide their identity. They will quickly remove their “lace pants” and other glamorous garb and don a pair of overalls and say to the people who accuse them of being of the clergy: ‘We are not clergymen; we are keepers of the swine or of the cattle.’ (Zech. 13:4-6) Their accusers will know such clergymen as liars and will show them no mercy. No time then for the Roman Catholic Hierarchy clergy and their allies to find refuge with the Lord, nor will deathbed repentance do them any good. Burning of candles and splashing of holy water and pounding things with their fists will not bring them any aid. The so-called “last rites”, by which they have deceived many people, will be of no aid to them. They will have no one to administer such foolish ceremonies. Those fellows have never been among the ones who in the acceptable time of the Lord have said: “0 Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the [nations] shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.” (Jer. 16:19) It will be the Jona-dabs that will then be able to apply this scripture to themselves, and they only of all the people of earth, aside from the remnant, will find refuge in the Lord.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>43</sup> And how about the “principal of the flock”? They will find no way of escape. The religious practitioners, who have embraced religion (so-called “Christian religion”) for personal and pecuniary gain, and have used the same and their positions in the organization to oppress the people, will be caught in the same dragnet that will destroy the clergy. After the destruction of the clergy, the “shepherds”, then the Godless “principal of the flock” will continue to fight against all who are on the side of Jehovah, and therefore they shall receive due recompense from the Lord. They will fail utterly to find any escape, but their end is destruction. (Rev. 19:19-21) Describing the “strange act” of Jehovah the prophet says: “Let none thereof escape.” (Jer. 50:29) All the “goat” class, whether they be of the clergy or be small practitioners in their flocks, shall suffer complete destruction according to the decree of the Lord. That decree is written and is certain to be executed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>49</sup> Even now the clergy, or “shepherds”, and the ‘principal ones of their flocks’ are frightened because of existing conditions with which they are surrounded, and they make a great bluff in trying to accomplish their wicked designs. The flood of truth flowing to the people, according to God’s command, is cutting away the foundations of the Hierarchy and their tools, and concerning such the prophet of Jehovah says: “A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”—Jer. 25:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>30</sup> First the clergy cry out, and then the howling of the “principal of the flock” follows. Jehovah orders them to howl, and they cannot get away from doing it, and the reason is, “Because Jehovah is laying waste the grounds where they fed.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> The hail and flood of truth now being proclaimed throughout the earth is wasting the feeding places of the Hierarchy and other clergymen. Millions of honest and sincere persons of good will are hearing the truth and arc fleeing from the bondage of “organized religion”, and such movement is drying up the once fat pasture fields of the clergy, and for this reason they set up a great howl and say: “Our religious susceptibilities are shocked, and these people are bigots, and their message is subversive.” Even though millions of sincere persons flee from the wicked organization of religionists, many more millions of persons will remain, to be exploited by the Hierarchy and other religionists. The complete spoiling of the pastures of the religionists will take place at the beginning of Armageddon, that is, God’s “strange act”, when by his great Officer, Christ Jesus, he breaks the power of the religionists completely. Seeing their institutions quickly crumbling, the Hierarchy and the principal of the flock let out a tremendous howl of despair.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>31</sup> The execution of judgment brings desolation upon them: “And the peaceable habitations [the prosperous pastures </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2">; homes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)</span><span class="font2"> ; pasture-lai ds of peace (Lccscr)] arc cut down, because of the fierce anger of the Lord.”—Jer. 25: 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>32</sup> So long have those of the Hierarchy and other hypocritical clergymen been entrenched in their refuge of lies that they have been quite at home there in their religious systems and have felt secure in their jobs, and that the people are for ever their pastures or fields which they may continue to commercialize and upon which to continue to live wantonly. The Scriptures strongly indicate that the Hierarchy and their supporters will come to the point where apparently they have succeeded in suppressing the witness work of Jehovah, and, feeling that they have triumphed over opposition, they will then think themselves secure and will say: ‘We arc in peace and safety.’ (1 Thess. 5:3) But their safety will be for a very brief period of time, because God will suddenly bring destruction upon them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>33</sup> Says the prophet of Jehovah, “In silent desolation lie the pasture-lands of peace, because of the fierceness of the anger of the Lord.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Leescr)</span><span class="font2"> “Then shall be silenced the prosperous pastures, because of the fierceness of the anger of Jehovah.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> No more shall the clergy and the principal of the flocks lord it over the gullible people. Only those who have devoted themselves wholly to Jehovah have the prom</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ise of finding refuge in the day </span><span class="font2">of his anger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font2">striking contrast with the calamity that is certain to befall </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">religionists Jehovah says to those who have found </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">refuge </span><span class="font2">in his organization: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font2">will surely assemble, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">O Jacob, all </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thee, I </span><span class="font2">will surely gather the remnant </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Israel, at once will I make them like sheep in dis</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tress, like a flock in </span><span class="font2">the midst of its pasture shall they hum with men.”—Mie. 2:12, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">** What </span><span class="font2">results from Jehovah’s “strange act”? “He [Jehovah] hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font2">land is desolate, because of the fierceness of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">oppressor, </span><span class="font2">and because of his fierce anger.” (Jcr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25:38) </span><span class="font2">Jehovah has become as a fierce lion in the exe</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">cution </span><span class="font2">of his judgments. Jehovah is the Father of “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”, who executes His judg</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ments </span><span class="font2">and vindicates His name. (Rev. 5:5) Jehovah </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">refers to </span><span class="font2">himself </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font2">the One who is all-just, symbolized </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">by a Hon. </span><span class="font2">He justifies and vindicates himself in righteousness by destroying his enemies, that the universe may be clean, and all who live shall do righteousness. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—Zcph. 3:8; Hos. 13:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Jehovah gives full warning to “Christendom” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">others who associate with “Christendom”. He </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sends </span><span class="font2">forth his witnesses now and proclaims to &quot;Christendom” that warning, even as Jeremiah did in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">day. He </span><span class="font2">also </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">caused </span><span class="font2">Isaiah to proclaim his prophecy concerning the day of his fierce anger. (Isa. 13:1-22) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her allies in religion have been warned, and yet they continue to mock God and to persecute his faithful witnesses. Having warned them, now Jehovah says to them: “Now, therefore, be ye not mockers, lest your bands </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font2">made strong: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.” (Isa. 28:22) Every part of Satan’s organization shall fall. As Jeremiah warned the people, so now the faithful ones on the side of Jehovah, who proclaim his truth, must continue to warn the people during the progress of Jehovah’s “strange work” and until its finish. To them Jehovah says, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font2">must say to others of good will: * ‘ Sly people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">soul from </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fierce </span><span class="font2">anger of the Lord.”—Jer. 51:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>,T</sup> It is in this present day that Jehovah says to his people: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” The time has come for all who love Jehovah to boldly take their stand and perform their duties in his organization. Those who really love God will now obey this commandment and go forth fearlessly, and therefore with boldness in the Lord, and proclaim the truths, and thereby have some part in the tearing away of the mask of lies behind which the religionists now hide. This they must do in obedience to God's commandment, that the people may have opportunity to intelligently flee to the only place of refuge. In obedience to this commandment of Jehovah those engaging in this work are having some part in God’s “strange work”, which work must be completed before Iiis “strange act” begins. Everyone who is now wholly devoted to Jehovah must and will “lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us” (Hcb. 12:1,2), and, being blind to everything *-ave that of the kingdom of God and its interests, will joyfully and amidst increased opposition push forward in the battle and lift high the standard of the Lord. It is the day of battle and of victory, and let all those who love Jehovah rest in him with full assurance. As Jehovah God did to Shiloh, so shall he certainly do to “Christendom” and all other parts of Satan's organization in the very near future. Rejoice now that have a part in his “strange work” and thus a part in the vindication of his glorious name, and look forward with ever-increasing joy to his “strange act”, which will completely and for ever vindicate his name.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark3"></a>VENGEANCE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH laj's responsibility for the present crime wave at the door of hypocritical religionists, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">any attempt </span><span class="font2">on the part </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">his “servant” class to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">hold </span><span class="font2">back the truth of and concerning that religionist </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font2">of Satan’s organization would be </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">mark of disloyalty to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Anyone who now professes </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">be in the truth and a follower of Christ Jesus, and who fails or refuses to declare the vengeance of our God against Satan and his organization, thereby gives evidence that he is not anointed by the spirit of Jehovah but, in fact, is God’s enemy. All who arc anointed of the Lord arc specifically authorized and commanded to declare the day of the vengeance of our God. (Isa. 61:2) Such must declare the vengeance of God against Satan’s organiza</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tion, </span><span class="font2">and since Satan’s visible organization is composed of false religious leaders and the principal of their flocks, the anointed of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font2">cannot prove faithful </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">except by </span><span class="font2">speaking the truth concerning them. It is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font2">a question as to whether some might become offended and refuse to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sole question for determination by the “serv</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ant” </span><span class="font2">is: ‘What has my </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font2">commanded, and am </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">obeying his commandments?’ The “servant” must declare the truth regardless of whether anyone is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">offended and </span><span class="font2">refuses to hear </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font2">many hear and turn </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to the Lord. </span><span class="font2">Let the remnant or anointed “servant” class, therefore, keep always in mind that obedience </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font2">commandments of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God is </span><span class="font2">what is required. Saul, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">once </span><span class="font2">anointed as the king </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Israel, did not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lose</span><span class="font2"> his anointing by reason of disobedience, but he was cast away from the Lord and joined the Devil’s crowd. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font2">Sam. 15:16-29) Those who are anointed will not lose their anointing and fall back into any “tribulation class”, but, if unfaithful to that anointing, such will be cast away from Jehovah and destroyed with the Devil and his other followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Organized Christianity,” under the influence of the Devil and practicing the Devil religion, is responsible for the great crime wave, particularly in America, where crime has increased most rapidly in recent years. Within a few years fifteen hundred were shot to death, many of whom were entirely innocent, upon the pretext that they had in possession or were using intoxicating liquor. This practice must be a stench in the nostrils even of many supporters of “organized Christianity”. The aneient Persians are said to have held an incense to the nose while worshiping the Devil or practicing Devil religion; and now likewise those who indulge in such Devil practice in the name of God and approve bloody crime and induce other crime, says the prophet, ‘put a branch to their nose,’ and this evil practice they do in the name of Jehovah and ‘have provoked God to anger’, and he declares that he will visit his anger upon them. ‘ ‘ Therefore will I also deal in fury’; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine cars with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.” (Ezekiel 8:18) The breaking of the everlasting covenant by the shedding of innocent blood at the instance of the leaders in “Christendom” is bad enough, but the worst of all is for them to do so and claim that God approves their action and that it is done in his name. This defamation of God’s name he declares shall not go unpunished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah, by and through his chief executive officer, Christ Jesus, executes his commandments. Since the prophecy of Ezekiel here considered has to do with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, which foreshadowed the destruction of Satan’s organization, particularly “Christendom”, it is certain that the Lord Jesus Christ is in command acting under the direction of Jehovah God. This conclusion is abundantly supported by the 110th Psalm and other scriptures. Jehovah gave promise to the Lord Jesus that he would put the enemy under foot and that Christ Jesus must wait until the due time thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The period of waiting ended, and God sent forth out of his organization Christ Jesus and commanded him to rule amidst all his enemies. Necessarily that means that Christ must destroy the enemy, Satan’s organization. This is further supported by the words of the prophet: “The Lord [Jehovah] at thy [Christ Jesus’] right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads [of Satan’s organization] over many countries.” (Ps. 110: 5, 6) According to another translator, “He will judge among the nations; there shall be a fulness of corpses, he crushcth heads on a widespread land.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font2"> Another renders the text: “lie judgeth among the nations, full of dead bodies! [and] hath crushed the head over a wide land.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font2"> &quot;Whether the word “head” means the Devil alone or includes other heads, cither construction is in harmony with the Scriptures. The Devil’s organization is made up of divisions, each division of which has a head; and this applies both to the invisible and to the visible. Since the destruction of the ciry refers to “Christendom” in particular, then the application to the leaders or “heads” thereof is proper and in harmony with other scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Christ Jesus comes forth to this work of judgment and is attended by a host of angels. “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit npon the throne of his glory.” (Matt. 25:31) “The Lord corneth with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all.” (Jude 14,15) The inspection completed, as described in the eighth chapter of the prophecy of Ezekiel, then Ezekiel heard a loud voice that cried out: “lie cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.” (Ezekiel 9:1) The language used shows that the cry was a loud and threatening command, and that it was sharp and powerful, and that it had a striking effect upon Ezekiel’s ears. That thunderous command was not to Ezekiel, but was given to “them that have charge over the city [‘Christendom’]”, to destroy it, “those . . . that have charge to punish the city.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font2"> This work of destruction will not be done by the “servant” class on earth, whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, but, as the Scriptures show, it will be done by the Lord Jesus Christ and his holy angels acting under his command. It was this angelic army of the Lord that fought against Satan and ousted him from heaven. (Rev. 9:16; 12:7) Undoubtedly in this army are also included those faithful overcomers whom the Lord has raised to life upon coming to his temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The commandment or cry which Ezekiel heard, therefore, was from Christ Jesus the executive officer of Jehovah. The cry or command directs the organization of the Lord to prepare for the final assault upon the enemy organization. They are told to draw near, not with their weapons sheathed, but with their weapons of destruction drawn and ready for offensive action. Those weapons that will be used for destruction by violence are held by the Lord Jesus Christ and the invisible members of the organization under him. The visible part of his organization on earth will do no part of the destroying. The work assigned to the earthly division, to wit, God’s “faithful servant” class, is to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name before and while the fight is in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those to whom the commandment was given responded, and Ezekiel beheld them approaching. “And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand ■ and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhom by his side ; and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.” —Ezek. 9: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These six men that approached were fully equipped for the slaughter that must follow. Six is a symbolic number denoting incompleteness, while the number seven symbolizes or denotes completeness. Jehovah’s organization is one, and is therefore complete, and is pictured by the number seven. There were six men armed and one clothed with linen. The entire number of seven men manifestly represented Jehovah’s complete organization, both that which is invisible to man and that which is visible and on the earth. 'Pho six men represent all of the invisible organization, with Chri&gt;t Jesus, and including the risen members of his body, cherubim, seraphim, and angels. The “one man” represents the anointed “servant” class on the earth, and which is the only part of the organization that is visible to human eyes. The fact that the division shovs six to one would further mean that the greater and more important part of the work assigned to the organization must be done by the invisible division, while the lesser work thereof is assigned to and must be done by the earthly division, represented by the one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The six men had ‘slaughter weapons in their hands' (jE.E.) ; “every man with his weapon of destruction.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> The marginal rendering of this authority is: “Dashing weapon [that dashes to pieces] ; shattering weapon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prophet Nahum, prophesying concerning the preparation of God's organization to make assault upon the enemy, says: “He that dasheth in pieces is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">come up </span><span class="font2">before thy face.” (Nah. 2:1) This further </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">definitely identifies Christ Jesus as in command </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">as </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">one who cried with a loud voice and who was </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">heard by </span><span class="font2">Ezekiel. Six men approached from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">way of </span><span class="font2">the north, which is the appropriate direction from </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font2">judgment should and does come. Without doubt </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the six men </span><span class="font2">in the vision represent ‘the armies which </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are in heaven', under </span><span class="font2">the command of the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore that part of God’s organization which is invisible to man. This is supported conclusively by the fact that they proceed from the north, the seat of authority and judgment, and that they have charge over “Christendom” to destroy it, and that they are armed with weapons of destruction and are under the command of Christ Jesus, who is commissioned to dash to pieces Satan’s organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH GOD now makes known to his witnesses the meaning of his prophecies. He sends forth his witnesses to give warning and to serve notice upon “Christendom” of her impending destruction. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Facts that arc </span><span class="font2">well known, when applied to the prophecy, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">enable us </span><span class="font2">to determine whether or not </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font2">have the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">correct </span><span class="font2">understanding of tiie prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the </span><span class="font2">year </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1918 </span><span class="font2">the Lord Jesus Christ suddenly </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">came to the </span><span class="font2">temple of Jehovah. lie came for judgment </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">as Jehovah’s great executive officer and to exe</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">cute </span><span class="font2">judgment..As such officer he gives commandment, saying: “Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">earth keep </span><span class="font2">silence before him.”—Hah. 2:20, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah, </span><span class="font2">as represented by Christ Jesus, is in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">temple. </span><span class="font2">This means that the people must be told </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of God’s </span><span class="font2">purposes to judge “Christendom” and to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">destroy it. </span><span class="font2">Otherwise there would be no occasion to com</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">mand that </span><span class="font2">all the peoples of earth give ear. It means </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">that there </span><span class="font2">must be a world-wide public witness work </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">done by the </span><span class="font2">‘faithful servants’ of Jehovah. Jehovah’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">standard for </span><span class="font2">the people must be lifted up. This gospel </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font2">kingdom must be preached as a witness, to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">end that </span><span class="font2">those who would hear may hear and take their </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">stand on </span><span class="font2">the side </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Jehovah and his kingdom of right</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">eousness. </span><span class="font2">Such is not </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">“harvest” work, but it is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a work of the </span><span class="font2">Lord of ‘separating the sheep from </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the goats’; and </span><span class="font2">his “servant” class is permitted to give </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">testimony which causes the people to take sides for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">or against </span><span class="font2">Jehovah and his kingdom.—Hatt. 25: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">31-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It was early </span><span class="font2">in the year 1918 that, for the first time, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the message </span><span class="font2">was sounded: “Millions now living will </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">never die.” </span><span class="font2">Within a very short time after a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">public lecture on </span><span class="font2">this subject was delivered, “the goats” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">got busy and </span><span class="font2">shut up many of Jehovah’s “servant” class </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in prison </span><span class="font2">and for a time effectually stopped the work. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Then in the </span><span class="font2">year 1919 Jehovah again revived his work </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">brought forth those devoted to him to engage in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it. </span><span class="font2">Shortly thereafter, to wit, in the year 1920, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society published </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a book </span><span class="font2">under the title “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. This book was printed in a number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">languages, </span><span class="font2">and millions of copies were distributed throughout “Christendom” and put in the hands of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">order-loving </span><span class="font2">people. With the coming of the year </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1922 the </span><span class="font2">witness work of Jehovah was getting well under </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">way, and </span><span class="font2">within </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">short time there was a world-wide witness given by public lectures on the subject “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore Jehovah provided the radio to broadcast the truth, and for several years, in spite of much opposition, the message of the kingdom was more widely broadcast than any other information given by radio. Within the past few years the message of the kingdom of God, put in book form, has had a wider circulation and publication than any message ever issued by any other organization on earth. Many persons of good will who are under the power of Satan’s organization have received the truth and accepted it as true, and arc thus marked in their foreheads, that is to say, have been given an intelligent understanding of and concerning God’s purpose to establish his kingdom for the vindication of his name and for the blessing of the people. A great multitude of such are giving heed to the message and taking their stand on Jehovah’s side. The duly of Jehovah’s “servant” is to obey the commandment and go throughout “Christendom” and do the ‘marking’. It must be remembered that this work of giving the testimony is not for the purpose of converting the people of the world and bringing them into some organization, but it is to make known the fact that those who desire to flee from the wicked organization of “Christendom” may do so and declare themselves on Jehovah’s side, and thus be in line to be brought through the time of trouble, when the slaughtering begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is not spoken of in a boasting manner fiom the standpoint of men, but those who are privileged to have a part in it do ‘boast in the Lord’ and give honor and glory to his name. They rejoice in the fact that the time has come for the establishment of God’s kingdom; and therefore faithful men and women are given some part in telling others of this good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fact that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is bitterly opposed by the “man of sin” and by the clergymen and the principal of their flock, who are members of the Devil’s organization, is further proof that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is doing the work which Jehovah commanded should be done and which was foreshadowed in the vision given by Jehovah to Ezekiel. Individuals who have part in that work are greatly blessed, but no individual is singled out and made more prominent than another. The “servant” of Jehovah is one. The “servant”, therefore, sees God’s purposes, and each one of the “servant” class sees eye to eye with the others, and they are going on performing this witness work according to Jehovah’s commandment. When it is recognized that this witness work or ‘marking’ is the work of Jehovah, and being done under his commandment, then those who thus recognize it will know that no power or opposition can stop it. The ‘marking’ work must be continued until it is completed; and when it is completed, the other order given by the Chief Commander, as heard by Ezekiel, will be performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ezekiel heard Jehovah give order to the “six men”, which six men represent the organization of Jehovah (aside from the small number on earth) and are invisible to man. As soon as the witness work is completed, then the following order is due to be carried out, to wit: “And to the [six] others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts w’ith the slain; go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.”—Ezek. 9:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please take note that the order from Jehovah is to slay, and to spare none, “but come not near any man upon whom is the mark,” that is to say, those who are on Jehovah's side are marked and are not to be slain. The slaughter begins “at the ancient men”, that is, with the elders and leaders, the clergy and the principal of their flocks. This slaughter is without regard to age or sex. “Organized religion” and the entire organization of Satan must be destroyed. Seeing that the slaying by the six begins with the clergymen, and none are spared, then surely the man with the writer’s inkhorn, that is, the “faithful servant” class, must not for pity or policy spare the clergy, when declaring the day of the vengeance of our God. It must mean that it is the duty and obligation laid upon the “servant” class to boldly declare the truth of God’s judgment against the hypocritical organization called “organized Christianity”. The “servant” class cannot be faithful in the performance of duty unless the truth is plainly and boldly told. Those who would oppose the bold proclamation of the truth, therefore, give evidence they arc not of Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Verse eight of the ninth chapter of Ezekiel strongly indicates that the remnant will stand by after the witness work is completed and watch Jehovah finish the wicked organization. Ezekiel prostrated himself before Jehovah and propounded a question. The attitude of falling down or prostrating oneself before Jehovah is the proper one for the creature to take before the Almighty Creator. The question propounded by Ezekiel while in that prostrate condition does not at all indicate that the “servant” class cries out in horror at the slaughter and begs for mercy, but rather that the “servant” speaks to Jehovah, as the prophecies show, to call forth a statement of Jehovah showing that the slaughter is entirely justified. Hence it is written: “And it came to pass, w’hilc they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah, Lord God! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?” (Ezek. 9:8) The battle of that great day of God Almighty, at Armageddon, will witness the complete downfall of “Christendom”, and that without any quarter or pity from Jehovah. The reply given to Ezekiel from Jehovah proves this fact: “Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness; for they say, [Jehovah] hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord sceth not. And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; but I will recompense .heir way upon their head.”-—Ezek. 9: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The order-loving people of today plainly see and well know that the nations called “Christendom” arc full of injustice and wickedness. Many of the clergy tell the people that God lias forsaken them because of their indifference toward “the church” and their neglect to support the same, while other clergymen tell the people that there is no Almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and that the Bible is unworthy of belief. God will not spare them but will fully recompense them for their wickedness. He will make a clean-up of the whole outfit, in order that all W’ho survive may know Jehovah is the only true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To each division of God's organization a certain part of the work of ridding the earth of Satan’s organization is assigned, and it will be required that each division be faithful in the performance thereof. In Ezekiel 9:11 it is written: “And, behold, the man clothed w’ith linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.” Manifestly the matter is so stated in this text of the prophecy to show that the “servant” class faithfully perform the work assigned to them and, w’hen it is done, in some w'ay make report thereof. That means that the w'itness work must be done and w'ill be done, and every one who hopes to have the final approval of the Lord as one of his remnant will joyfully participate in the witness or ‘marking’ work. The faithful remnant will joyfully obey the commandments of Jehovah and will receive his approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This scripture further indicates that some of the remnant will be on earth when the work is done, and will w’itness Jehovah’s battle at Armageddon from their vantage point under his protection. These will maintain their integrity toward Jehovah, and by their faithfulness will be a testimony to the supremacy of the Most High and to the honor of his name.</span></p>
