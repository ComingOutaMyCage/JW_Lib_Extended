<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“Communism”—the Devil’s Route to Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE objective of the Devil is world-wide Fascism, under the direction, preferably, of tools like Mussolini, but pleased to take Franco, Hitler, or any like Catholic that will do his bidding. A Protestant would do just as well, only if he will do what he is told. America is headed for Fascism, and the United States Government is doing what it can, and all it dares, to aid the Hierarchy (chief instrument of the Devil) put his plans across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is an example:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370714_files/g_E_19370714-2.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:265pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Just another bastard, just another doorstep job; in fact, just one more lie</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Fordham University is a Roman Catholic institution. Its professor of law is Edmond Borgia Butler. Mr. Butler is secretary of the governing board of the Emergency Relief Bureau. It now appears that the Workers Alliance (alleged to be Communist) has 406 hours of contacts with the branches under Mr. Butler’s control, while all other organizations (596 of them all together) have a grand total of 1,130 hours; that figures out at about two hours apiece, as against the “Roman Catholic Communist” (?) layout of 406 hours, so skillfully framed up by Mr. Butler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hierarchy is working tooth and nail to make Communism look like the big issue in America, and doing everything possible to make the balloon as big as possible. What a farce! When the Hierarchy-made Communism is big enough, there will be a grand rush of the Hierarchy-controlled newspapers and the Hierarchy-controlled American (?) Legion to make it clear to America that her only salvation from Communism is to turn everything over to the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Others besides </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> have caught on to the methods by which the Hierarchy is out to capture America. The following is to the point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Football.</span><span class="font6"> The discrepancy between actual evidence of Communism in the United States and the publicity which Communism gets puzzles many keen observers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A great religious group is making all possible capital out of the “Red menace’’. No opportunity is lost to publicize an arrest of a Communist or to play up a meeting of a handful of would-be Reds. The Communists always put on a good May Day show in New York city, but a careful checkup reveals that they have neither bulk nor weight in the nation at large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some responsible New York leaders deplore the disproportionate fanfare stirred up by the doings of a small and essentially insignificant movement. The religious group is not averse to publicity, and, of course, the Communists revel in it. So everybody is happy except those who feel that public interest is being used as a football to serve group purposes.

<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Michigan’s Whirling Dervish Says So</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Who says America is ready to rush into the arms of Communism<sup>1</sup>? Who but the great (?) “Reverend” “Father” Coughlin? He ought to know. You heard all about his following of 8,000,000 people and how they melted away to Roosevelt like snowflakes in July. Did that faze Charles E.? Not at all. The Hierarchy figures that the common people have no sense and will always believe everything every priest tells them, regardless of how silly it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And so Coughlin, in his periodical </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Social Justice,</span><span class="font7"> in a scare headline five columns wide and four inches deep, issue of May 24, 1937, quotes with joy the following: (From Governor Murphy of Michigan) “Communism . . . is here.” (From President Roosevelt) “[When] Communism breaks in America, it will be in the Detroit area.” Do you believe any of them really mean it? Not in the slightest. All are working to one common end: the turning of everything in</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">America over to the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The state secretary of the Communist party in Michigan personally visited the Chrysler plant at Flint, Michigan, to see the facts for himself and found not one Communist involved in the sit-down strike there. He was of the opinion that those endeavoring to fasten the blame upon Communists were acting as stool pigeons for others; and his suspicions are undoubtedly correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Windsor, Ontario, Roman Catholic priest “Reverend Father” Gregory L. Blonde publicly alleged that seventeen members of the Windsor police department are Reds. Immediately brought to task by the Board of Police Commissioners, he had to confess that he could not name a single police official who is a Red, and that he had merely repeated what others had told him.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The mayor and others thereupon gave him a good tongue-lashing; which served him right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">California had another “red” scare. Red flags were noted along certain highways, bearing cryptic numerical symbols. The constabulary gathered them up, and then the State Highway Department got mad because the work they had done showing where certain roads were to be widened had to be done all over again.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>John the Revelator a Communist?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> will be amused to learn (?) that John the revelator was a Communist. At least that is what the “Right Reverend” Monsignor J. A. Pompeney, Roman Catholic theologian, thinks. In an address, eight full columns of which are printed in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Kansas Workman</span><span class="font7"> (R.C.), he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men who do not see ‘red’ and who do not think ‘red’ with the communists, know that the millennium is only a dream that ends ultimately in a nightmare of con</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fusion and of political death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Professor Harry F. Ward, of Union Theological Seminary, has been telling the Methodists that anti-Communism is a smoke screen behind which the pope, Mussolini and Hitler are lined up to destroy democratic government. He says, truthfully, “The issue is not Fascism or communism; it is Fascism or democratic government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is most interesting that within a period of about five days, around September 15, 1936, all the principal dictators of Europe, Hitler, Mussolini, Metaxas, Schuschnigg, and Pope Pius XI, launched into violent attacks upon Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Manifestly these attacks radiated from a common center and that center is Vatican City, with the object of stirring antipathy against the Spanish Republic and in favor of the discredited and vicious Roman Catholic rebels that are finding Madrid a harder nut to crack than they had anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dictators always have to have an excuse for robbing the people of their liberties; which is why General Metaxas, dictator of Greece, was loud in his outcries against Communism when he threw the Greek constitution into the scrap heap and announced Greece would have no more parliaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Big Excitement/</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Big Drive on Reds!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is time for everybody to get excited. Here is a statement from Chicago that “a group of grim-faced men today were mapping in Chicago a nation-wide campaign against Communism’s assault on American religious institutions”. Reading on it seems that they were Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergy.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">toriums was said to</span></p><img src="g_E_19370714_files/g_E_19370714-6.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:249pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Woeful tale of the fair (?) wanton</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">And then here is another statement that 200,000 Catholic Daughters of America will try to enroll another 100,000 women so that they can all go after the same birds. And so on, and so on, ad infinitum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And these pesky Communists: how many of them are there? Well, to get down to facts, there were in the national election a grand total of 80,096 Communist votes out of the 45,818,198 votes cast. And, ladies and gentlemen, you can see yourself that, if in every village in the United States there is one Communist voter out of every 1,772 voters in the town, what a terrible crisis this is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why, you poor sap, right here in free America the Communists have got such a hold that there is almost one of them to every 4,000 persons in the land; and if that wouldn’t scare the pajamas off your Aunt Mehitabel, what would ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some idea of the terrible danger of Communism’s grabbing the Empire State may be gathered from the columns and columns and columns against Communism in every Rome-controlled paper in the country. Also, there is the actual fact that, in the last election, out of 3,293,222 voting in New York state there was a terrifying total of 40,406 Communists. Why, man (Stop your laughing! haven’t you got any sense?), that is one out of every 81 voters in the most populous state in the Union, and you can see yourself that as soon as 3,252,816 of the voters come over on their side they will have all the voters in the state. This is a warning to all Roman Catholics to hurry up and rush into the arms of the Hierarchy while yet there is time, and bring along as many suckers with you as you can find. Rome needs them.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Smith Admitted He Did Not Know</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Big excitement in New York city! Mass meeting against Communism! One of the big audi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">be two-thirds filled! Al Smith was one of ye great speakers and should have elicited great applause with his admission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">never read any intelligent explanation of the Communist government other than that it was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">wild theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Smith should</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">have gone on to say that, though he knew nothing about what he was fighting, he was fighting it anyway, because he is a Catholic and the Hierarchy wants him to fight it; and the reason why they want him to fight it is that the American people will look to the Hierarchy as the “saviors of civilization” and cheerfully turn everything over to them to run as they see fit. “Reverend” Edward Lodge Curran, of Brooklyn, was also there in the same capacity and for the same reason as ex-Governor Smith, and had the same mental grasp of the situation, but he said one thing that Al did not say, and that shows what was in his mind, and his real motive, i.e., civil war:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hope we haven’t waited too long, as they did in Spain, where tonight they are fighting it out. If the Communists want it that way, we will give it to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, a distinct threat of civil war if the Roman Catholic Hierarchy cannot have its way with the duly elected government of the United States, as it is trying to have its way with the duly elected government of Spain. In the one case it encouraged the military officials to break their oaths of allegiance, and turned its churches and convents into arsenals. What will it do in the other case? &quot;Father” Curran went on to say:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The world’s premier Communist propagandist</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Father&quot; Clemens and two other Catholics were fried for reading and circulating Communist literature regularly during 1933 and the early part of 1934. The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> had a 16-inch story on this, grieving over the fact that the trial was in its second week. Here was a case where the Roman Hierarchy was caught red-handed in the manufacture and circulation of real Communist propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Reverend Father” Rossaint was sentenced to eleven years’ penal servitude, “Reverend Father” Steber to five years, “Reverend Father” Julitch to two years, and “Reverend Father” Kremer to one and one-half years. The “Reverend Fathers” Clemens, Himmes and Schaefer were acquitted, for lack of evidence. Following precedent, quite possibly all were let out the back door the same day they went in the front door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But now here is the devilish part of it, and the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> cannot well be innocent of what it published. Immediately following the 16-inch story of what happened to these guilty Catholics was a two-inch item from Frankfort-on-the-Main referring to the trial of Jehovah’s witnesses and making the malicious and false statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thirty-six were accused of having received Communist propaganda from Lucerne, Switzerland, “clad in the guise of religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great Jehovah God will not hold the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> guiltless for its act of perfidy in letting this piece of Roman Catholic propaganda go through its hands, and attempting thus to shift to the shoulders of absolutely innocent Christian men and women the guilt for Communist propaganda which it should know, and must know, and does know lies squarely on the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“F a t h e r” Rossaint, “F a t h e r” Kremer, “Father” Steber and “Father” Clemens introduced Communism into Catholic Youth groups and Rossaint allowed Communists wanted by the police to sleep at his house; he also distributed Communist literature. Jehovah’s witnesses did none of these things, but the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> lets itself be used as a cat’s-paw to divert the blame to them. The indictment against the four priests and their coconspirators covered 154 typewritten pages and 27 witnesses appeared to prove the charges of the Catholic-Communist conspiracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Arnaldo Cortesi, Rome correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> makes the significant admission that Communism and Fascism are definitely moving towards each other. This admission supports the view that both are of the Devil, through Gog, his prime minister, and both aim at the complete subjugation of the people to the state. That both are dictatorships needs no argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that Stalin was educated for the priesthood is borne out by the fact that when he gets ready to kill off a bunch of influential men they are all brought into court and condemn themselves to death and admit the most impossible and foolish things imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Soviet trials there is the same abandonment of all the elementary principles of justice, the absence of authentic documents, the absence of independent witnesses, and the absence of legal defenders, that characterized the Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pope and Stalin should get married: they are as alike as two peas in a pod. Nobody with any sense could have any sympathy for either one of them. Radek testified he was tortured for ten weeks to make him tell the story the O.G.P.U. wanted him to tell.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Are Jehovah’s witnesses communists? Most of our readers will smile at the question, but many are aware that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is trying to put across the idea that they are communists. It will not be difficult to disprove this foolish charge, born of a desire to hinder people from learning the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Soon be big enough to scare the cowardly papal matadors of the public press into 17 assorted and categorical fits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">As far back as 1895 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> (official organ of Jehovah’s witnesses, then known as Bible Students) stated, “The Bible does not teach communism.” This statement appeared in an article entitled, “They Had All Things Common.” The article was a discussion of the scriptures concerning the temporary communal arrangement in the early church, and showed that while the apostle Peter and other apostles co-operated in that arrangement, neither he nor any of the others ever taught it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It mentions the fact that the apostle Paul instructed the church to do things which it would be impossible to do as members of a communistic society—each to “provide for his own”; to “lay by on the first day of the week” something for the Lord’s service, according as the Lord had prospered them; that servants should obey their masters, rendering the service with a double good will if the master were also a brother in Christ.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Early Church Not Communistic</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> of January 1, 1902, appears another article dealing with the same subject, the general trend of which is indicated by the following quotation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been assumed by some that communism as that term is applied today was practiced in the early church; and it is the claim of some that it should never have been discontinued, but should always obtain amongst the Lord’s people. We answer, first, that the early church did not practice what is now known as communism; second, that something akin to what the early church did practice (but modified) still is the rule amongst the Lord’s saints; third, the extreme view (and practice) of the early church was apparently not intended to remain, was never enjoined by the Lord nor the apostles, and serves rather as an evidence against the feasibility of the doctrines of communism under present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So far as the record shows, there was no compulsory division of wealth, such as communism purposes. On the contrary, everything was voluntary; and everything of the same kind is just as free, just as voluntary, and just as proper, now as then—no more so, no less so. Some of those who owned farms and personal property sold them and brought the money and placed it at the apostles’ feet—gave it into their charge. Some may have given all that they had in this manner, but it is not so stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the contrary, various things give the inference that Barnabas, who sold the field and gave the money, may still have retained other properties, which no doubt he would have been willing to have disposed of later, and to have made similar use of the money as it might be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sin of Ananias and Sapphira did not consist in their not putting all of their property into the common treasury, but in their deceitfulness in the matter; —in their pretending to give the entire proceeds of one property when they did not do so. Some Scriptures clearly intimate that some of the Lord’s people at that time had private possessions aside from those which were put into the common fund. (See Acts 12:12; 21:16) ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is noteworthy that the apostles neither commanded nor advised communism; nor do their writings intimate that it prevailed in the early church. As showing that there were both rich and poor in the assemblies of the primitive church, note the apostle Paul’s words to Timothy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy: that they do good, that they be rich in good works, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ready</span><span class="font6"> to distribute, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willing</span><span class="font6"> to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.” (1 Timothy 6:17) . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle James says,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?”—James </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font6">15,16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Latest development of a famous pox</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Society give evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses do not look to communism for deliverance from oppression any more than to other human governments. In the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What You Need,</span><span class="font7"> under the title “Earth’s New Rulers”, appears the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Imperfect men are all more or less selfish, and where selfishness exists a perfect and righteous government cannot exist. The radical movements, such as Communism and Bolshevism, could never establish a desirable government, because these, like other organizations, are controlled by selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greater the ignorance and the greater the selfishness, the more unsatisfactory the rule or government. It must be apparent, to all who think, that no men now on earth could establish and carry on a righteous government. With keenest interest, therefore, every thoughtful person should give heed to the manner in which Jehovah will establish a righteous government amongst men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font7"> the following paragraphs well set forth the views held by Jehovah’s witnesses with respect to communism:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Looking over the history of the nations whose governments have been either that of a monarchy, an aristocracy or a democracy, not one has been found to be entirely satisfactory to the people. The history of every nation shows that it has been a struggle between the classes. It has been a few against the many. It has been a contest between the exploiting and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">exploited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a general rule, the class smaller in number has ruled and oppressed the class greater in number. These struggles have resulted in many revolutions, great suffering, and much bloodshed. Out of these struggles have developed the various theories or forms of government called radical, including communism, socialism, the soviet and bolshevism. The birth of these has been due to the struggles of the oppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Communism advocates a sharing of all things in common, aiming at the abolition of private ownership of property and at holding of all property for the benefit of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Socialism holds that the means of production and distribution of the wealth of the nations are the collective properties of the workers, who by their efforts produce that property, while the goods which are to be consumed become the private property of the individual workers. Such government would do away with the aristocratic class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Out of the World War was born the soviet government of Russia. Peoples of that nation had long suffered under a monarchy that bordered closely upon a tyranny. The war furnished the opportunity to overthrow the monarchy. “Soviet” really means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">council </span><span class="font6">or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">harmony.</span><span class="font6"> The soviet government, however, has been anything but harmonious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The government is made up of councils of working men and soldiers called deputies. There are various councils and one supreme council. The Soviet rule is called an organized form of dictatorship of the proletariat, but this government denies the right of suffrage to certain classes. The soviet government has not been </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">success and never can be, and is far from being satisfactory to the people who have tried it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As in all other forms of government where the people are supposed to have a voice, the demagogues and party men dominate the various councils; and therefore the government has presented no advantages over any other government. In fact, bolshevism has resulted in great suffering of the people, and it is feared by many of the other nations and governments of the earth.—Pages 244, 245.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bolshevism is doomed to certain and complete failure. The same must be said of communism. Such radical movements for the establishment of a government of the people can never bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the peoples of the nations. Many other nations of the world greatly fear bolshevism, and properly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any form of government that denies the rights and privileges of some and shows special favors to others is certain to end in disaster. Monarchies have been harsh, cruel and oppressive of the people, but bolshevism and communism are even worse. No government can bring happiness to the people unless it is founded upon honesty and administered in righteousness.— Page 13.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Jehovah’s Government the Only Hope</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The government which Jehovah God will establish with Christ as its King is the only real hope for the world. It will bring that which all honest men instinctively desire, though they know not how to express it and are not aware as yet that this grand panacea for man’s ills has been provided by a gracious Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is seeking to brand “Communist” everyone who does not bow to its whims. Thus it hopes to clear the earth of those who for one reason or another are not in favor of being exploited by selfish religionists, or who from devotion to principle and obedience to Jehovah God would rather die than imply by word or gesture that the same Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the acme of goodness and truth, when it is in fact the most insidious and wicked foe of Christ and Christianity that ever disgraced God’s footstool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hierarchy is a sorry refuge from the errors of communism, and subserviency to its dictates is a most undesirable alternative to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Of two evils, choose neither. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to look for the government that is founded in righteousness, and which even now is making itself evident through the resistless testimony of events in fulfillment of divine prophecy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Russian Experiment </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By James A. Williams</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE aftermath of the revolution in Russia brought with it many problems demanding the immediate attention of the new rulers, not the least of which was that of dealing with the “homeless children” who were becoming a menace in Moscow and other large towns. These young people had formed themselves into gangs and were living by theft and other crimes. In order to assist in coping with this problem a colony, known as “Bolshevo”, was formed. In course of time, as the children grew older and conditions improved, a new use had to be found for the colony. It was therefore decided to turn Bolshevo into a center for dealing with hardened criminals, having as its object the turning of them into useful members of society, and today results prove that this object has been attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a rule, only criminals with a record of three terms of imprisonment are admitted to the colony, where they lead a life as nearly as possible similar to that of the ordinary Russian citizen. No special uniform is worn and, although the unmarried members sleep in a dormitory, the married ones live in flats. Work is provided in the factory, where sports goods, such as tennis rackets, skis, footballs, etc., are made, or in the grounds of the colony, where fruit and vegetables are grown. The colonist receives the ordinary wage of the Russian worker, subject to a substantial reduction during the first few months, when money might constitute a strong temptation. Wages are paid at all times in a special currency making impossible the purchase of playing cards or vodka and other intoxicants. Gambling, drugs and drink have been the chief failings of those who enter the colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For shopping purposes a co-operative store is run. Recreation is provided in the same way as for other workers in Russia. In fact, the only difference between colonists and ordinary Russian citizens is that the former have lost their citizenship and have no right to become members of a trade union or of the Communist party until citizenship is regained. Also, they are not free to marry, either a girl in the colony or one from outside, nor, if married, can they bring their wives into the colony, unless the permission of the executive is obtained. Such permission is not usually granted until after the first eighteen months of life in the colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another difference between life in Bolshevo and that outside is that colonists must be indoors by 11 p.m. After that time, however, they are permitted to talk or read if they wish, and those who know something of the average Russian need not be told that plenty of talking goes on until well after midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three kinds of punishment are inflicted: deduction from wages, loss of the weekly rest-day, and, worst of all, expulsion from the colony. The latter is applied only in cases of theft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most striking features of Bolshevo is that there are no warders, no police and no officers except the director of the factory, the doctor and one or two other officials. Any member of the colony is free to leave at any time, but if he does so he is seldom, if ever, able to return, and that means that his hope of regaining citizenship has gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A polyclinic and a hospital care for the health of the community and, while the percentage of sickness is above the normal during the first few months after a colonist’s entrance, thereafter health conditions are normal. Improvements in this as well as in other matters are paid for out of the profits on the goods made by the factory, and, as marketing troubles are unknown in Russia, there is never any difficulty in disposing of stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As in other parts of Russia, not more than 10 percent of wages goes in rent. Meals, which are not expensive, are usually taken in one of the factory canteens, managed by a colonist who has chosen to remain in Bolshevo after the expiration of his time. Some of the married colonists prefer having their meals at home. On free days members of the colony are at liberty to go where they will and, following the usual practice in the Soviet, they receive full pay when on their yearly vacation. General and technical education is afforded, while children, of course, go to school in the ordinary way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The usual amenities of a Russian factory life are provided: radio, a club, cinema, sports, and so on. Lectures are given from time to time, while a specially equipped theater, a fine studio for the art class, an orchestra, athletics and lawn tennis help to make conditions such that many workers in other lands might envy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An example of what can be accomplished is seen in the case of Avdeyenko, a former thief and murderer, found, after a drunken brawl, unconscious in the snow by some members of the colony. He was taken to the commune, but the freedom of the place soon began to pall. He would stay away from time to time, and was disappointed to find that nobody interfered with him. No locks, no bars, no roll call! For one who had always looked upon society as his enemy, this was too bad!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In course of time, however, he began to fit in with the scheme of things, although there were occasional lapses. Things seemed to reach a crisis when he violently assaulted another member of the colony and was tried, not by a judge, but by the colonists themselves. From that time forward he became a useful member of the community, learning to read and write, and ultimately—proudest day of all—being recommended for membership in the Young Communist League. Citizenship regained, married and happy, Avdeyenko is now a Russian novelist of distinction, and society has a friend where it once had an enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bolshevo has been a bold experiment, the success of which cannot be gainsaid. An English critic of Russia, and one of the strongest critics at that, wrote on returning to England, after a visit to the colony, that what he had seen there made him feel that the spirit of Christ still existed on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What are some of the reasons for this success? First of all, Soviet Russia is a land unhampered by traditions and is therefore free to experiment in a manner feared in other countries. Public opinion, which hinders prison reform in a country like England, a country in the van of such reform, counts for little or nothing in Russia. Then the psychological attitude toward criminals in Russia is fundamentally different from that in other countries. In Russia a criminal is looked upon as an individual whose work is needed by the state, while in practically every other country a criminal is looked upon as a menace to society and one to whom to give employment would in itself be almost a crime, as it would increase the already large army of unemployed. One of the greatest difficulties in starting such a colony in practically every country apart from Russia would be the finding of suitable work for the colonists which would not compete with the existing overproduction outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The aftercare of prisoners is another problem existing in countries outside the Soviet, where, after his discharge from Bolshevo, a prisoner finds no difficulty in obtaining employment. The democratic idea of self-government and equality existing in Russia makes practicable and natural the management of the whole colony by its members and also does away with the “prison stigma” which is an obstacle reformers in other lands find difficult to surmount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The success of this experiment proves that liberal reformers elsewhere have the right idea. There is, however, only one way to deal with the problem of criminals, and that is to prevent crime; and crime will never be prevented until Jehovah’s King holds sway from one end of the earth to the other. Until that time all efforts of men, however good, must fail.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Suggestions on Science</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font7">ESPITE his efforts to the contrary, man does occasionally learn something, or thinks he does, and what he thus learns he calls “science”. </span><span class="font8">He </span><span class="font7">often has to revise and modify his findings, but makes progress, nevertheless. Following are some things he recently learned:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Science corroborates the statement of the Scriptures that the earth ‘hangeth upon nothing’ and is therefore a globe. The highest camera shot ever made, taken from an elevation of 13½ miles, and with the horizon 350 miles away, plainly shows the horizon like a great arch across the photograph. Particulars are in the May (1936) issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The National Geographic Magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Details of the continents buried by the Flood are now being brought to the surface by a punch which, dropped on a line a mile and a half deep bites off a bit of the bottom. The true and ancient shores of the oceans seem to average a mile below present sea level; so says Prof. Reginald A. Daly, of Harvard University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is believed that the oldest living creatures on earth are some insects and a few lobsters found recently in central Siberia, dug out of the solid frozen earth, where they have been since the days of the Flood. The method of revival was not stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under 400 feet of gravel, in a mine near Fairbanks, Alaska, there have been found skeletons of mastodons and other creatures that perished at the time of the Flood.

The period of time devoted to the creation of things on earth can be Scripturally shown to be six “days” of seven thousand years each, or a total of 42,000 years.

<p><span class="font7">Hundreds of dispatches are published in the daily press that plainly show the existence of the fallen spirits, and their influence on men, women and children, and yet the newspapers are never able to find anybody who knows the truth on the subject. For instance, here is a London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font7"> dispatch from Riga, Latvia, telling of a child of ten years of age, unable herself to read or write, who can tell and relate the inmost thoughts of those who are in her presence. Thus the director of the Latvian Medico-Legal Institute tested these powers and found the child could transmit perfectly French, German and English texts read by Dr. Neureither (the director) silently, though she does not understand one word of any of these languages. In the face of evidence like this, what folly to close the eyes and ears and mind to the facts that prove the existence of these demons cast out by the Lord and the apostles, and everywhere manifest in clairvoyant and telepathic phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dispatch from Hollywood contains the following description of a clear case of demonism caused by a ouija board:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An apparently normal twelve-year-old boy who goes into a trance and talks Persian, who lets eye specialists blindfold him carefully and then reads what is placed before him, baffled 150 medical men Sunday. The boy, Pat Marquis, outside of his trances, is normal. He discovered his apparent powers by accident, while he was playing with a ouija board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While hypnotized by the demons Marquis repeated medical terms he had never heard, and answered questions on every kind of subject. If Marquis continues to yield his mind to the control of the invisible powers with whom he has been in contact through the ouija board, he will go insane in the end, as millions have done before him. The physicians who examined him did not in any way indicate that they knew the lad is under control of demons, though if they had even a superficial knowledge of God’s Word that would be immediately apparent to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">British people are stirred because Abdul Latif, a Persian physician who died in A.D. 1231, is alleged to perform cures through a medium, and to have cured some 2,000 people of their bodily ills.

The medical advice and assistance comes from demons that seek thus to entrap the human family and find this an excellent means of entrance into the mind and will of the weak and suffering.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In some cities clairvoyance is illegal, but in Budapest one of the police is under control of the demons (as are all clairvoyants) and has helped to reduce the number of suicides. He has helped to solve murders and to locate missing persons and missing jewels. Stockholm may employ a clairvoyant similarly. The general employment of spiritists in police work would be a matter of grave interest to the people.</span></p>

The demon, operating as usual through a spirit medium, gave with great exactitude what purported to be the exact moment and place where Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and Mr. Pethybridge sank, 75 miles off shore, when their plane struck the water. The demon made the mistake of specifying the exact latitude and longitude, to the thousandth of a degree, and the New Zealand man discovered that the point named is on land. The demons are called in the Scriptures “lying spirits”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Bellevue Hospital, New York, an elderly man suffering from amnesia was hypnotized and gave his name as Edward Gordon Thomas. This tallied with initials on his tie clasp, but it did not tally with the facts, for his name was E. G. Trenholm; and this pretty well shows how much confidence may be properly placed in any information gained by hypnotic means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">College students at Baton Rouge, La., undertook to hypnotize one another. One boy of nervous type succumbed to the work of a fellow amateur and while hypnotized shot himself in the chest. When awakened at the hospital he had no recollection of what had happened. Hypnotism, like “religion”, is demonism, and should be shunned as a plague by all who love God and His Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The ceiling of the Philippus Evangelical and Reformed church building at Cincinnati, Ohio, caved in and set the congregation back $30,000. This is quite a hunk in these hard times; so the grown-up boys of the church hired a regular circus to act for them, including as a side-show feature a real Hindu magician and snake charmer, with the hope of getting enough coin together to pay the bill. Not sure just how they made out. The magicians and sorcerers had a hard time back there in the early church. On one occasion Paul said to Elymas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind . . . for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.—Acts 13:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But if the clergy of today be reproached for taking sorcerers into partnership, they can set up as a defense that Paul had no church with a $30,000 ceiling to come crashing in on him, and, besides, it is said that when he did this he was filled with the holy spirit; and on this point they are entirely innocent and ignorant and their plea is 100-percent perfect.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Not All Clergymen Entirely Blind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">While it is generally true that the clergymen are blind to the truth, yet here and there is one who is not entirely sightless. In an address at New Haven, Connecticut, Professor Charles A. Dinsmore, of the Yale Divinity School, made the truthful and inspiring statement, “No book compares with the Bible in the number of sentences in which thought is expressed in a form which cannot be improved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Somebody must have put some truth literature into the hands of Reverend Dr. William H. Rogers, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Broadway and 79th street, New York city. In a recent sermon he is quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Organized religion is a failure and doomed to destruction. It does not represent the New Testament faith or the Christianity of Jesus Christ. Rather it represents ritualism, ceremonialism, hierarchies, politics, modernism and worldliness. God hates religion. Religion is one thing. Salvation is another. The first is of man’s invention and thinking. The second is God’s gift in Christ. If the apostles came back in the flesh, they would not recognize very much in the organized church as truly representative of the true church of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Philadelphia Methodist conference adopted a resolution stating:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fifty-seven generations of Christians have come and gone, and yet the masses are still shackled by social bondage; the children of the world are deformed by child labor; the laboring folk of the world are still hired and fired and junked in the name of Mammon. More than half of the human race still goes to bed hungry and undernourished. Millions of men, anxious for work, are out of employment, with no chance except to rust and rot in idleness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it not strange that men who can speak like that oppose the message of God’s kingdom as the one and only hope of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably unaware of how clearly he discerned the meaning of present-day events the bishop of Leicester, England, recently said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Europe and Asia alike, young men and women are growing up in countries where the leaders are obsessed by the domination of economic forces, leaders who are wholly materialistic in their outlook, and in whose policies and actions there is no place for God. In other words, this is a day of crisis and that too-hard-worked word must be used—it is a day of judgment on the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE apostle definitely identified Christ Jesus as the Rock, of which Moses was a type, when he wrote: “And did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ” (1 Corinthians 10:4) Jesus Christ is the great Executive and Builder of Jehovah. He is the Builder of His church, of which Christ Jesus is Head and Foundation Stone. (Isaiah 28:16) There is a total absence of proof that the church is built upon Peter, but all the proof is that the church is builded upon Christ Jesus. The church is the temple of God, His spiritual house, as it is written in the Bible: “Ye are the temple of God.” (1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16) “Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.”—Ephesians 2: 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each one who becomes a member of Jehovah’s temple organization, of which Jesus is the Head and Foundation, is symbolically designated as a stone, even as Jesus named Peter. The testimony of Peter himself, written under inspiration, conclusively shows that Jesus did not refer to Peter as the primary one, the stone upon which the church is builded. Said the apostle: “Ye also, as living </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[Diaglott]</span><span class="font7"> stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that be-lieveth on him shall not be confounded.” (1 Peter 2: 5,6) Here Peter identifies Christ Jesus as the Foundation Stone of the building. Those professed Christians who have advanced a contrary theory, such as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are, in the language of the Scriptures, disobedient and have stumbled over Christ the Stone, as Peter said.—1 Peter 2:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Peter was never a pope. Peter never had a successor. For these two reasons no man by God’s approval could ever assume the office of pope, as claimed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The doctrine of the Roman Catholic church concerning the pope is stated by their own literature as follows: “Pope: The title pope, once used with far greater latitude, is at present employed solely to denote the bishop of Rome, who in virtue of his position as successor of St. Peter, is the chief priest of the whole church, the vicar of Christ upon earth.”—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Volume XII.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Apostolic succession.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman Claim.</span><span class="font7"> The principle underlying the Roman claim is contained in the idea of succession. ‘To succeed’ is to be the successor of, specially to be the heir of, or to occupy an official position just after, as Victoria succeeded William IV. Now the Roman pontiffs come immediately after, occupy the position, and perform the functions of St. Peter; therefore they are his successors. We must prove (a) that St. Peter came to Rome, and ended there his pontificate; (b) that the bishops of Rome who came after him held his official position in the church.”—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Volume I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no absolute historical proof that Peter ever went to Rome. Even if he went to Rome, that would be no proof in support of his primacy or the pope’s being his successor. The Scriptural texts cited by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in support of their claim are found at Matthew 16:19 and John 21:15-17. Neither of these Scriptural texts in the least supports the Hierarchy’s conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To Peter Jesus said: “And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.” (Matthew 16:19) This text does not mean that Peter was supreme over and above the other apostles. Paul, addressing the Corinthians, says of himself : “I was not a whit behind the very chiefest [of the] apostles.” (2 Corinthians 11: 5) In fact, if there was any difference, the position of Paul was one of greater responsibility than that of the others, because he was made a special apostle to the Gentiles, chosen and commissioned by the Lord as such. (Romans 11:13) He wrote the far greater amount of instruction to the church under the Lord’s direction. The words of Jesus to Peter concerning the “keys of the kingdom of heaven” assigned to Peter a specific work to perform, and when Peter performed that work it could never be performed again by himself or by any other.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE following pungent excerpts from a recent Hitler publication, and cited by the Berne (Switzerland) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tagwacht</span><span class="font7"> of August 28, 1936, in connection with the court trial against the Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses], will prove of more than passing interest ‘at such a time as this’. In the course of the court proceedings the attorney for the defendants raised the question why the case against the Bible Students should have come up in Berne at all, and why the plaintiffs, who are posing as defenders of the church, both Catholic and Protestant, do not also protest against the Hitler Youth, the Black Legion and the New Paganism, all of which make such drastic and direct attacks upon the Catholic and Protestant churches and call for direct action against them. A pertinent supplementary to this legitimate question was furnished by the court president with reference to a book by a certain Dr. Jam (a National Socialist) published recently by the National Publication Society of Leipzig (a Hitler concern) under the title “The Catholic Church as a Danger to the State”, from which we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lust for world dominion on the part of the Catholic Church actually represents an arrogant challenge of the most monstrous kind, keeping in mind the obsolete, reactionary, extremely intolerant, antiscience, liberty-, spirit- and culture-destroying system, based upon falsification of historic world events, lies and deception, and the infamous accursed past of the Catholic Church, that is so steeped in human blood shed by them, and so sunk in the morass of numerous vices and crimes committed by them, so that moral degeneracy and repellant criminality are written upon her forehead, constituting an ineffaceable characteristic of the Catholic Church, etc., etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concluding, the editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tagwacht</span><span class="font7"> asks, “If the Messrs. Todtli-Fleischhauer, who pose as protectors of churches, take no stand against such invective and accusation against the Catholic church, what right have they to accuse the Bible Students, whose appeal is solely and only upon the Bible?”'—From German </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Just to Have It in the Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font7">UST to have it in the record, this is to mention that in the month of May, 1936, an impostor, falsely calling himself one of Jehovah’s witnesses, called on the mayor of Northampton, Mass., with the ostensible object of getting the mayor to become a member of the organization, but the real object of drawing further reproach upon God’s faithful people. This end was achieved; the Springfield </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Union</span><span class="font7"> carried an article with the caption, “Jehovah’s witnesses Seek to Enroll Mayor; Receive Sharp Rebuff.” Jehovah’s witnesses had nothing to do with this, but can guess who did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Falsely Accusing the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE insidious propaganda of the so-called Jehovah witnesses is going merrily on. The latest perhaps is this one. Talks by Judge Rutherford are recorded on phonograph records and are offered ‘without any obligation’ to anyone in the privacy of their own home. Why, even one of Jehovah’s witnesses will bring these records with a phonograph and play them on request and the person thus requesting may invite friends and relatives into the home. Let our people carefully guard against these ‘wolves in sheep’s clothing’ as our Savior so aptly characterized them.—(Lutheran) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Northern Nebraska District Messenger.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Afraid to Come Out of Their Holes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE ignorant and bigoted clergy that are back of the so-called “Tri-State Vig. Society, Baxter Springs, Kansas” do not dare disclose their true names or their true addresses. As soon as they do they will be prosecuted for sending defamatory matter through the United States mails. Their two leaflets, one entitled “Beware of the Quack Religion” and the other stutteringly entitled “The Truth, The Truth, The Real Truth about Rutherford and His Quack Religion”, are both silly, claiming, in one clause, that the witness now being given in the earth is “a terrible graft on the poor people who are fleeced out of thousands of dollars a year” and, in another, that “the squad of about 15 sold only a dozen books, at Columbus a few more”; also, “At Columbus the agent got $25 worth of books, could not sell them and had to work on relief to pay for the books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just how books which would be low-priced at $2.50 each, beautifully bound and illustrated in four colors, are “a terrible graft” on the poor people in whose hands they are left on a contribution of one-tenth of that amount, is something that only a hypocritical clergyman who dares not disclose his name could explain. Only a clergyman could lie so stupidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One thing is certain: no clergyman would soil his pretty hands by working on relief so that he could pay the cost of books, wonderful books, explaining the Word of God, and then, on his own time, and at great effort, take those books to the people at a fraction of their real cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As soon as this bird discloses his identity he will have a chance to explain in court his published statement that “Mr. and Mrs. Hall, agents for this part, are pests, and detested by all who know them, take warning and be prepared”. Not only are these words slander, but they also constitute a threat, as is implied also in the imaginary name given to the alleged “society”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dodgers contained twenty errors in spelling and punctuation, showing the mental level of the author. The dodgers are not worth reproduction in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age;</span><span class="font7"> they merely show to what a low level the clergy have fallen, when they are willing to publish and circulate defamatory matter and dare not disclose their identity or even the printing office where the work was done, and then try to scare somebody by the use of the once dreaded words “Vigilance Society”. If there were a real Vigilance Society at Baxter Springs its first duty would be to find the author of these silly bluffs in the name of “religion”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Now, Isn’t That Just Too Bad?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">THE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Transcript,</span><span class="font7"> Hartford, Conn., has a dispatch from Vienna containing the following sorrowful statement of an alleged Swiss Catholic People’s Association, but which, on a bet, is purely another name for the Roman Hierarchy. The directors of the Association are made to say,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For some time past the “witnesses of Jehovah” have carried on propaganda against any form of ecclesiastic Christianity, whether Catholic or Protestant. They flood the country, even remote mountain villages, with hundreds of thousands of copies of propaganda literature, among them the fortnightly </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> Therein they insult the church in a most spiteful manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the name of the Catholic men of all Switzerland the Swiss Catholic People’s Association protests against this defamation of the Catholic faith, the calumniation of the pope and the clergy in general, the injury done the religious feelings of the Swiss Catholics, and the insolent breaking of religious peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We demand strict measures to be taken by our authorities against the impertinent activities of these disturbers of peace, who attack the religious communities recognized by the State, their leaders and their institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, isn’t that just too bad? The blurb goes on to demand, with the usual statements of their own power and dignity and majesty and other bunk, that steps be taken (in Switzerland) to stop all this avalanche of truth. Burp!</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ames Spurlock,</span><span class="font7"> of Oklahoma, writing of the O AYS L. C. Ross, working in the flood area foolishness of the interest system, discussed <sub>o</sub>f Delhi, New York:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">in the February 10 (1937) issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">May I call attention to the fact that this system has piled up a $20,000 interest-bearing debt on every 160 acres of land in the United States, including mountains, deserts, swamps and golf courses. Is anyone so foolish as to believe this can ever be paid?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The land area contains 11,895,104 tracts of 160 acres each, or a grand total of 1,903,216,640 acres. The public debt, at the close of the last fiscal year, was $33,778,543,494; that would amount to only about $2,815 per 160-acre tract. But the public debt is only a relatively small portion of the total debt. Civic debts are usually about one-eighth the assessed valuations. Corporate debts are colossal; so are private debts. Payment is impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Embarrassing Mr. Sloan</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font7">MBARRASSING Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., president of General Motors Corporation, Homer Martin, president of the United Automobile Workers of America, pointed out that at the average rate paid for all automobile workers, and the average hours worked per week, it is impossible for the average General Motors employee, with an average family, to purchase even the lowest-priced car produced by the corporation. Mr. Martin also, and properly enough, drew attention to the inhuman speed-up system which, in effect, makes the average employee through at forty years of age. The whole system is so preposterous that it is silly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE Diamond Match Company has done a fine thing. It declared a labor dividend of $140,000, and distributed the money among the employees in the lower ranks. The management and higher-paid salaried men were excluded. Most Big Business executives never had a generous or noble thought in their lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">C</span><span class="font7">ARTER OIL COMPANY, Sinclair Prairie Oil Company, Stanolind Crude Oil Company, Oklahoma Pipe Line Company, Stanolind Pipe Line Company, and Sinclair Prairie Pipe Line Company have been sued by the Government for buying oil from the Osage Indians and cheating on both the quantities and the prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note the plea in the newspapers for help in this area. We meet workers going about begging alms for flood sufferers, yet we have the first person yet to meet (and we call at every home) who has received any of these alms. In most eases these have to come through some clergyman, and it can easily be imagined who gets helped. As the water receded a number of CCC boys were sent in to help clean up, and it was the fine homes they worked at. In the case of the many poor sufferers that needed help the most, they could clean up as best they could. Charity has surely become a profitable business to those engaged in it, using the suffering of humanity in the most vile racket ever concocted.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>Where Was the Good Samaritan?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">T Jacksonville, Florida, in January, the body of John T. Jones, 49, was found under a vacant house. The account said he had “a wound on the head and bruises about the body, but an autopsy performed by Dr. R. R. Killinger, county medical examiner, showed the wound to be the result of an old operation, and death due to ‘exposure and hunger’.” Does it not seem just too bad that a sick man, old and battered, has to crawl away under a house to die in midwinter of cold and hunger, in a land where there is such an excess of pigs and cotton? And does it not seem just possible that the One who marks the sparrow’s fall also marks the fall of poor old bruised and starving John T. Jones and in due time will inquire where all the good-church-member Samaritans of Jacksonville were the night John died?</span></p>

Usury as high as 300 percent annually is common. A Manila court today recorded three convictions for usury, in which the lowest rate was 60 percent.</span></p>

Just what kind of meal can be bought in Newfoundland at a little bit more than the fifth part of a thin dime is not clear at this distance, but, if Newfoundland politicians are like American politicians, what was saved in feeding the widow will be spent with a lavish hand elsewhere. The condition of the Newfoundland people was so desperate that flour was imported in sacks instead of in barrels as formerly, so as to provide clothing for the children. There are children in Newfoundland who have never seen money; and, on account of lack of soil, there are sections where soil has to be brought in schooners to enable the people to bury their dead.

Many victims have gone out of their minds, and this torture has been used and is being used on a large scale. There are 16,000 political prisoners, and the majority of them have been subjected one time or another to the most revolting cruelty.

His letter arrived safely after being dispatched by what he calls the Tin Can Mail. The mail is sealed in a tin can and dropped overboard from a passing steamer, whereupon a native swims out from the shore and secures it. The natives are either Roman Catholic or Free Methodist, depending upon on which island one chances to live. After Vete had translated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font7"> into Tongan he read a large part of it to a highly interested group of native church-workers. They seemed much pleased and amused at the references to “purgatory”. He did not discern the cause of their enjoyment until later, when he discovered that on the outside of the building was a group of Catholics taking it all in. The next day he received a short letter from the priest, not at all satisfied to have the “purgatory” doctrine denounced. The next time the priest had a funeral service he spent the bulk of his time denouncing Vete and claiming for himself all honor as the only educated man in the island.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>Disobedience Dishonors Both God and Christ</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font7">O ONE in his right mind would wish to dishonor either the great Creator or His Prime Minister, Jesus Christ, man’s Lord and Redeemer; yet many have done so and are doing so to this day. This state of mind does not take place in a moment; it is brought about gradually. Years of association, in the minds of some, gradually breed familiarity, neglect, indifference and, at last, contempt of the most sacred, the most holy. Today’s story is of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ark of the covenant represented both Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The Shekinah light, ever between the cherubim in the Most Holy, represented the great Creator. “Give ear, 0 Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.” (Psalm 80:1) “[Jehovah] reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.” (Psalm 99:1) “And I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony.”—Exodus 25: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The blood of the bullock, offered on Israel’s day of atonement, was sprinkled upon the mercy seat seven times. (Leviticus 16:14) This illustrated how Christ “offered himself without spot to God”. (Hebrews 9:14) It is apparent, therefore, that the entire cover of the ark, it being all of one piece, and of solid gold, cherubim and all, represented Him of whom the apostle reverently speaks when he says, “The head of Christ is God.”—1 Corinthians 11: 3.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>The Ark Also Represented Christ</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus said “I and my Father are one” (John 10:30) He showed the close union that has always existed between himself and His heavenly Father. This same thought was in the apostle’s mind when he said, “To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.” (1 Corinthians 8:6) Christ was with the Father when the foundations of the earth were laid. He was and is attached to the Father through all eternity, looking ahead. There are many things that show that the contents of the ark represented Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One thinks immediately of the golden pot of manna and of Jesus’ own words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever.—John 6:47-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides the golden pot of manna, left as a reminder of God’s care over Israel in the wilderness, the ark of the covenant contained Aaron’s rod that budded. Who dares to even hint that there is any authorized teacher of the Word of God save only the Father’s own Spokesman? He himself said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. (John 14:10) Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these.—John 5:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition, the ark of the covenant contained the tables of the law, the expressed will of God for His typical people. Christ is the only one that ever kept that law. Mary did not keep it, nor John the Baptist; the teachings of the Roman Hierarchy are in error on these points, as on every other item of Christian doctrine. They have nothing straight; not one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Little History of the Ark</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A little history of the ark, a very, very brief one, is that, made under explicit directions and instructions of God himself, it was carried by Israel forty years in the wilderness, and represented the Divine Presence in their midst. The cloud hovering above it by day, and the pillar of fire by night, indicated whether the camp was to remain in that place or move on to another. Directly above the mercy seat God communed with Moses or Aaron or Aaron’s successors when they had need of divine assistance. The description of the ark is now inserted in the story, with the request that it be particularly noted how it was to be transported from place to place:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold; within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it. </span><span class="font6">And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. And thou shalt make two chcrubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end; even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.—Exodus 25:10-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Ark Was Quite Heavy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ark was quite heavy. The mercy seat alone, made of solid gold, 45 inches long by 27 inches wide, with the large cherubim upon it, and all of one piece, probably weighed at least 200 pounds, and the ark itself, with its tables of stone, golden pot of manna, Aaron’s rod, staves and gold plating “within and without”, no doubt weighed another 200 pounds; so the four men who carried the ark of the testimony had to be real men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably, to bear that ark of the testimony caused considerable discomfort to the flesh; and yet what a privilege! And so, quite naturally, one thinks of the divine arrangement that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">if so be that we suffer with him.</span><span class="font6"> (Romans 8:16,17) For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake. (Acts 9:16) For we which live are al way delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. (2 Corinthians 4:11) For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake. (Philippians 1:29) If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. (2 Timothy 2:12) But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings. (1 Peter 4:13) Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.—1 Peter 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The one who expects to serve God acceptably without suffering may as well quit now as any time; there is no way to do so. To bear the ark of the testimony forward, and thus to fulfill the will of God, calls for all the powers of His faithful witnesses, His priests.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Now Back to the History</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">From the days of Joshua to the days of Samuel the ark was located at Shiloh. The sons of Eli did not appreciate either the honor or the privilege before them. They thought of the ark as a talisman, or fetish, and took it with them into battle, thus grossly dishonoring the Creator. The ark was taken by the Philistines. In its presence their god, Dagon, had his head and arms and legs cut off (What fun the holy angels must have gotten out of that!) and the Philistines were plagued so dreadfully that they were glad to send the ark back home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In returning the ark, the Philistines placed it upon a cart, with oxen drawing it, and those oxen headed straight for the land of Israel. On its arrival, the men of Beth-shemesh, and others, 50,070 in all, died before the Lord because they had the temerity to look into the ark. That lesson should have been sufficient, one would think, but it was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ark was brought on up to the house of the priest Abinadab, and there it remained for seventy years. Nor did Abinadab or his house appear to be greatly blessed as a result. Its being specifically mentioned that, seventy years later, when the ark remained only three months in the house of Obed-edom, during all that time his house was blessed, plainly suggests that the reason lay in the reverence and love and honesty of the family.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>In the Days of David</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">After David had conquered Jerusalem, and gained important victories over the Philistines, he moved all Israel to bring the ark from the house of Abinadab to Jerusalem. Thirty thousand men of honor were named as a sort of reception committee. The 24th Psalm was composed for the event, which, in fact, was designed to picture the coming of the Lord Jesus to His temple in 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The earth is [Jehovah’s], and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; for he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hath </span><span class="font6">founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of [Jehovah] ? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from [Jehovah], and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font6">[God of] Jacob. Selah. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[Margin]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? [Jehovah] strong and mighty, [Jehovah] mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory ? [Jehovah] of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was the place of the sons of Abinadab to learn how to properly perform their part in the great ceremony, but this they signally failed to do. The place for them to look for instructions was in the law of God, to which, no doubt, they had access; most certainly, in fact. But what did Uzzah and Ahio, these two sons of Abinadab, do? They followed the example of the Philistines. Uzzah seems to be the one chiefly at fault. He is named first.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>Why Uzzah Was Smitten</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Had Uzzah looked in the Holy Writ he would have learned that four men, all descendants of Kohath (none other), must bear the ark, and none of them must so much as touch it lest they die. (Numbers 4:15) And they might not even bear it until it had been covered with badgers’ skins and a cloth wholly of blue, put over it by Aaron and his sons and their descendants in the priestly office.—Numbers 4:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of obeying instructions, Uzzah did as the Philistines, exactly, new cart, oxen and all. The whole story of what happened is found in the 6th chapter of 2 Samuel:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale [Kirjath-jearim, the home of Abinadab] of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of [Jehovah] of hosts, that dwell-eth between the cherubims. And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah [the hill where he lived]: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. And they brought it out of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">house </span><span class="font6">of Abinadab, which was at Gibeah, accompany</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And David, and all the house of Israel, played before [Jehovah] on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. And when they came to Naehon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it: for the oxen shook it [stumbled]. And the anger of [Jehovah] was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.— 2 Samuel 6:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It hardly seems that it is necessary to draw any conclusions; they draw themselves. Uzzah represents the “evil servant” class, intent upon serving God, oh, yes, but not in God’s way. He intends to do it as the Philistines do it; various devices (antitypical carts and oxen) shall bear the burden of carrying forward the ark of the testimony, but not he.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord Jesus bore testimony from door to door and it cost Him something. It killed Him in the end. If He had just stopped talking about His Father’s kingdom He might have lived on indefinitely. The apostles followed in His steps. They met the same fate. And Jehovah’s witnesses are following in the steps of the apostles, and know what to expect as a consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But which is better, to obey and die as Jesus died, or to disobey and die as Uzzah died? Death is certain either way. But the death of one now is the moment of his eternal triumph; and the death of the other, his moment of eternal disgrace. Choose ye, this day!</span></p>

In many instances the money could be much more wisely used to aid the living in obtaining a knowledge of God’s purposes. Money spent on the dead is largely wasted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing Above the Clouds </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By W. B. Akin (North Carolina)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font7">ANY events have happened in regard to the witness work in Georgia since March of this year, most of which has been reported to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> But one singular event was evidently overlooked that may be of interest to those who look for the real persecutors of the witnesses. On Friday, March 19, when nine of Jehovah’s witnesses were arraigned before Police Court Judge Cone in Atlanta, who was sitting next to the judge on the bench but Felton Williams, one of Atlanta’s biggest Methodist preachers ? It may also be stated here parenthetically that Judge Cone is a Sunday-school teacher in the above dominie’s church. Earl Withers, the first defendant tried, was convicted and sentenced after the arresting officer admitted that he arrested him only because he was seen to come out of a house with a bag in hand and enter the sound car. Williams was no doubt pleased with his underling’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The witness has been given in various ways, and sometimes under peculiar conditions, but one incident that is very striking happened while we were working Mitchell county, North Carolina, in June, 1935. This county is located among the scenic Blue Ridge mountains just north of Asheville, and, like the rest of this section of the state, is noted for its cold, healthful spring water, beautiful scenery and wonderful summer climate. Included in our territory this day was Roan mountain, elevation 6,287 feet, where hundreds of visitors come every year. Of course, man has commercialized on this beauty spot by charging a toll of 50c for each car to drive to the peak. There is a tollhouse located on each side of the mountain. After playing the five-minute lectures “Jehovah” and “Rebellion” for the tollkeeper away up in the clouds, he took six bound books. Then said the tollkeeper, “I would like for my buddy to hear that lecture”; and with that he went to the phone and called up the tollhouse four miles down the other side of the mountain and said, “Hold the line to hear something worth while”; and with that we lifted the phonograph to the mouthpiece while the lecture was given, and when it was over the man who had already gotten the books explained our work to the man at the other end of the line, and it ended by the second tollkeeper’s getting a set of the books because of his appreciation of the lecture heard over the telephone. And so our experiences continue.</span></p>

You know plenty about such racketeers. But the greatest racket of all has never been exposed in the newspapers.
