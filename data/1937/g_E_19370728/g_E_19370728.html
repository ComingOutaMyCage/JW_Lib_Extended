<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Father” Felix vs. Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">E</span><span class="font7">LSEWHERE in this issue are some references to the unspeakable corruption prevalent among the Roman Catholic priesthood of Germany. Let them speak for themselves. At home, in America, different conditions, but equally shocking to honorable men, are characteristic of the same class. One of these is “Father” Felix, of Missouri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Felix is the author of two booklets attacking Judge Rutherford. Acting on his behalf the National Catholic Welfare Conference, American propaganda arm of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has distributed to the Catholic press, and to the radio stations of the United States, an attack on Judge Rutherford which here receives some of the attention invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some questions arise in one’s mind, aside</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Gentlemen, on the facts pertinent to this ease there is, I believe, no quarrel. Yesterday evening I read to a fellowmember a passage on page 44 from this booklet entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font7"> written by Judge Rutherford, copyrighted 1937, and published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society with headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, and branch offices all over the world. While I was reading Mr. Brown turned from a neighboring table to inquire whether I myself shared the ideas expressed by the passage I had read. I affirmed. Mr. Brown then did two things: First, he presented his visiting card; secondly, he gave follow are, of course, fictitious, but the facts and figures they give are only too true.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">from Mr. Felix’s proposed “painful blow in the face” and threats that the one he so hates “shall once again, God willing, wear the stripes of a convict”. These questions are now put, not for his benefit, for he is past that, but for his honest fellow men. Before hearing the questions, note first some exhibits on the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quotations from Felix’s booklet entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rutherford Uncovered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Free speech, by all means, but when that blessed privilege is abused to vilify our fellow men, to breed discord, to cavil at constituted authority, to prepare</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">me a painful blow in the face. ...” (Page 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He paused a moment, then said: ‘ ‘ George, I understand you. You’re afraid I ascribe too much importance to the fool in this case. Maybe I do, but this enemy of the Stars and Stripes shall once again, God willing, wear the stripes of a convict. By my martyred boy I swear it!” (Page 32)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quotations from N.C.W.C. “News Service”; advertising the above-named booklet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pamphlet proper deals with developments in a club after one member seeks to enlist another “in the army of Jehovah’s witnesses. ’ ’ The foreword says “the club meeting and the characters in the story that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">675</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">‘‘The statutes of our state provide that in the absence of the regular presiding judge of our circuit courts the members of the local bar shall select one of their members to take the place of the regular judge until he returns. Thus it comes about in every court of our commonwealth that all the members of the local bar are privileged to preside over the circuit court from time to time. In this way it happened that in all the years that he was a member of the Cooper county bar of Boonville, Mo., Mr. Rutherford presided over the local court on four different occasions, each time for one day only.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Shrine of the Little Bigot</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The magnitude of the anti-Catholic and antiAmerican influence of ‘ ‘Judge” Joseph F. Rutherford, arch-bigot and ex-convict, is shown by the nation-wide chain of radio stations on which his talks are now heard several times a week. Father Richard Felix, O.S.B., of Pilot Grove, Mo., himself a veteran of the radio, who has dedicated himself to counteracting Rutherford, has just compiled this list. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Father Richard’s list shows Rutherford is heard weekly on 149 radio stations in the United States and possessions only. Most of these stations carry his program three times weekly, but some carry it daily and one Brooklyn, N. Y., station carries his talks eleven times a week. According to Father Richard’s information, the bigot now sends out 440 anti-Catholic radio programs every week. Besides these, he broadcasts over a great many foreign stations.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Why Dodge the Issue?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">What is the reason why the Roman Hierarchy finds it necessary to issue a forty-page booklet filled with statements about Judge Rutherford made by characters which they admit “are, of course, fictitious”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why do they, in their newspapers, find it necessary to blare with a triple headline, “Pamphlet Refutes Rutherford Claim to Title of Judge,” when in the very same article they are forced to admit that “Mr. Rutherford presided over the local court at different occasions” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The law provides that the person elected by the members of the legal profession to serve as special judge must possess the same qualifications as the regular judge, must take and subscribe to the same oath, and is clothed with the same power and authority as the regular judge, and while he presides he is as fully a judge of the Circuit Court as the one elected for the full term. He therefore is to all intents and purposes legally and actually the judge of the Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Circuit in which Judge Rutherford practiced is composed of five counties. The members of the bar elect the special judge, and, as stated by a noted lawyer on a former occasion, the members of the bar</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">know the qualification of the man they elect and are therefore much better qualified to select a suitable man than the rank and file who know nothing about it and who choose judges for political purposes. Not everyone who is admitted to practice can serve as special judge, but only those who </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">are elected by members of the bar</span><span class="font7"> at the Court where he serves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why is it that, having written that forty-page booklet entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rutherford Uncovered</span><span class="font7"> and which “Father” Richard Felix, O.S.B., hopes to sell for ten cents, he also has in press another 32-page booklet, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rutherford Refuted,</span><span class="font7"> the price of which will probably be the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The answer is that the Roman Hierarchy is in the tighest spot it was ever in. Actually the living representative of the Devil, the Hierarchy has falsely claimed to represent Jehovah, the true and living God, and has twisted and distorted the Word of God, and has manufactured history and told lies innumerable to make its claims seem plausible to the uninformed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the Roman Hierarchy had any confidence whatever in the truth of its position it would be the first to accept repeated challenges which Judge Rutherford has made to the religious leaders of “Christendom” to publicly debate with him the questions at issue and which questions can be settled only by an appeal to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Rutherford is preparing the soil for Communism.” Mr. Felix knows that that is a deliberate lie on his part. He has read Rutherford’s books, particularly his book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font7"> in which he makes the statement that Communism can never succeed, but that only God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus can bring about the relief and comfort which the people so much desire and need.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>&quot;Their Might Hath Failed”—Jeremiah 51:30</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Not only has the Roman Hierarchy flatly refused to comply with the request of 2,630,000 Americans, many of them Catholics, that such a debate be held, but now when Judge Rutherford has presented to the public in the booklets </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font7"> the truth regarding the Roman Hierarchy, the agents of the Hierarchy resort to smallness of soul, meanness and contemptibleness to a degree which only the Hierarchy can attain by seeking to accuse Judge Rutherford of falsely appropriating to himself the title Judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friends of Judge Rutherford well know, not only that this title was bestowed upon Judge Rutherford for the service which he rendered in Missouri, and which the N.C.W.C. has to admit that he did render, but that it was his friends, and not himself, that applied this title to him, using it, properly, to the glory of God and not of man. Judge Rutherford never speaks of himself as Judge, and has never claimed any credit for being so called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It should be carefully noted that Judge Rutherford never strutted around with a three-story crown on his head, or claimed for himself the title “Reverend”, “Very Reverend,” “Right Reverend,” “Most Reverend,” or the following titles which have been manufactured for the pope entirely without any Scriptural authority or any support in reason or common sense, by the most conceited, arrogant, pompous pretenders that ever lived upon the face of the earth:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Climax of Blasphemy</span></h3>

<p><span class="font7">Rock against which the proud gates of hell prevail not Infallible Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Head of all the Holy Priests of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After this partial list of titles it might be just as well for the Roman Hierarchy to pipe down in their efforts to prove that Judge Rutherford is not entitled to the title which his fellow lawyers in Missouri bestowed upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Getting right down to brass tacks, both Judge Rutherford and the Roman Hierarchy stand before the great Judge of all the earth, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is acting for and in behalf of the Supreme Judge, Jehovah God. What does it matter whether Judge Rutherford, given his title by his fellow lawyers, uses it or, as the National Catholic Welfare Conference seeks to infer, he should not use it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thoroughly familiar with the Scriptures, Judge Rutherford would be one of the first to say to the Roman Hierarchy in a matter of this kind, “It is a very small thing that I should be judged of you.” (1 Corinthians 4:3) But it is a very important thing that the Roman Hierarchy, brought before the judgment bar of God for its dreadful and immeasurable blasphemies, stands silent and ashamed in the presence of Him who has foretold in the Scriptures the impending destruction of the Devil and of the Devil’s religion.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Lay Aside the Title</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Lay aside the title Judge if that would please you better. It is wholly immaterial so far as the issue is concerned. Let us call him only Rutherford. Felix would create the impression that Rutherford has committed a great wrong because he served lawfully as a special judge of the Circuit Court of Missouri, elected to that position as the law provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Felix well knows that Rutherford wronged no one by reason of the fact that others continue to speak of him as Judge Rutherford. He must have been an honorable member of the legal profession; otherwise his fellow lawyers would not have placed him on the bench even temporarily.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Felix calls himself “father”; the world will bear witness to this photo of his children</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Now compare that with Felix’s own record, which he cannot deny and for which he has neither excuse nor justification. He poses before the people as “Father Felix” and yet he has no legitimate children, having never been married. What other children he has is not disclosed, and therefore he is not entitled to be called “Father”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The title that Felix assumes is misleading, to say the least of it. But, furthermore, he takes the title “Father” and advertises himself as such as though the Lord authorized him to be so called, and thereby willingly and deliberately violates the commandment of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he claims to serve. Jesus commanded in these words, 'Call no man father upon the earth.’—Matthew 23: 9.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>A Direct Violation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Felix therefore falsely and in violation of the Divine law assumes and uses the title “Father”, and by the use thereof he is enabled to fraudulently carry on his racket, by which he collects money from the gullible people upon the pretext that he as a clergyman can pray for their dead friends who he says are in “purgatory” and thereby shorten the duration of their 'conscious suffering’ in “purgatory”; and by this means he collects and receives money, he well knowing all the time that no such place as “purgatory” exists or ever did exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is not one scripture in the Bible that supports the “purgatory” theory. It is purely a man-made invention, and all the scriptures touching on the condition of the dead pointedly declare that they are unconscious in the grave, not knowing anything, not suffering any kind of punishment or pain, and that only the Lord Jesus by the grace of Jehovah God can bring them out, and that He will do so without Roman Catholic prayers and without the contribution of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the use of his title Felix is working a fraud upon the people and actually obtaining</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">money by fraud and false pretenses; and under the laws of Missouri, where he resides, the obtaining of money under false pretense is a crime punishable by a long term in prison.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Why Lie About the “Convict” Claim?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Felix has the audacity to charge Rutherford as being an ex-convict, when he well knows that that is not the truth. The following are the facts well known to him and many of the Catholic clergymen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the World War a general of the United States Army visited Rutherford and demanded that he direct young men that were his fellow Christians to take active service in the army and violate God’s commandment by killing their fellow men. Rutherford refused to do so, saying to the general that every one of the young men must determine for himself what to do; that he had no authority to command them to go to war, and would not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That statement angered the general, who then, in the presence of several witnesses, used these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A company of clergymen recently met in Philadelphia and unanimously passed a resolution which was sent to the attorney general’s office by special committee of their number, demanding that the Espionage</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Law be amended so as to make the trial by court martial and the punishment death, and that was done to get you [meaning Rutherford], Such an amendment was offered in the United States Senate and President Wilson advised against its enactment and it was not enacted. We know, however, how to get you anyhow, and we are going to get you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To that statement Rutherford replied, “You know where to find me. I shall not violate God’s law to please men.” Within a short time thereafter he was arrested and put on trial, charged with violation of the Espionage Law.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370728_files/g_E_19370728-5.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:267pt;">
<p><span class="font6">Felix busy proving to the world that the Hierarchy has no use for a real Christian</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>A Prostitution of Justice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Perjured testimony was brought before the court, Catholic priests attended the trial and consulted frequently with prosecuting officers. A book was introduced in evidence, upon which his conviction was asked, which book was not written by him. A prejudiced judge committed many errors in directing the jury what to do. An adverse verdict was rendered. That judge sentenced Rutherford to eighty years in prison and then denied him bail bond upon any terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Application was made to the Court of Appeals, and a Catholic judge, Manton, refused bail. Application was made to the Supreme Court of the United States for bail bond. During all that time Rutherford was held in prison. Chief Justice Holmes heard the application, and readily granted bond and ordered the release of Rutherford from prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was certainly not a convict pending the appeal which was taken immediately following the trial. He being released on bond, the Government voluntarily dismissed the case. Therefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rutherford’s record stands as clear as any man’s on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Felix, however, would make the people believe otherwise, in order to prevent some of them from reading an explanation of God’s Word. He will be reminded that the Bible shows that every one of God’s faithful witnesses from the time of Abraham to John the Baptist was persecuted by religionistsand thrown into prison on false charges and then the Lord himself was maliciously and foully charged with sedition, convicted and executed. Likewise His apostles suffered punishment, and in every instance the religious clergy, such as Felix claims to be, backed up and forced the prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rutherford was an</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">honorable lawyer in Missouri who saw the corruption and wickedness amongst the clergymen. He began to study the Bible and saw that God has a provision for establishing a righteous government in which clergymen shall have no part. He quit the law practice and has since devoted himself to explaining the Bible to the people, and that without money and without price.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>No Man Has Helped the People More</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">There is no man on earth today who has done more to help the people understand the Bible than Rutherford, and the only people that oppose the work that he and his fellow Christians are doing are such men as Felix, and yet Felix claims to be a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any honest man comparing the record of Felix and Rutherford surely would turn away from Felix as he would from an animal that raises a stink to the treetops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why does Felix get so angry because Rutherford publishes the truth? He cannot find a single instance in which Rutherford has ever attacked any clergyman personally. In his publications he has not even named any clergymen, but merely called attention to the wrongful practices of a religious system which is deceiving the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Felix shows that he has read the books that Rutherford has written, and from them he has necessarily read the scriptures which show that the present time is the judgment day when Christ Jesus is judging particularly the men who claim to serve Him and Jehovah God. From what is published in those books Mr. Felix must clearly see that the statement of Jesus is true, that “there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out”.—Luke 13:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Felix knows the Scriptures clearly teach that faithful men such as Abraham and the other prophets will be in the Kingdom as the representatives of Christ Jesus on earth and no Catholic priest will have any part therein, but be cast out, and, because these and similar truths are proclaimed today, he becomes angry and gnashes his teeth and advises that those who tell the truth should be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only is Felix doing violence to his fellow men who have been led to trust him as a preacher, but he is keeping some of them from gaining a knowledge of God’s gracious provision for them, and is sealing his everlasting doom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Felix Has No Way to Answer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Felix sees and admits that millions of people from every country and clime are accepting the truth as published in the Bible and as explained in Rutherford’s books, and this makes him and the rest of the Hierarchy extremely angry. Felix has no way by which he can answer these truths, and there is nothing that Mr. Felix can do but try to besmirch the one who is telling them. That, however, does not at all affect the truth of his books and the truth of God’s Word in any manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In times past God has used even a jackass to proclaim His truth, and a jackass is much preferable to be used than a man like Felix, who insists upon the people’s violating God’s law and blaspheming His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Felix knows that there is not a Catholic priest in America that has the moral courage to stand before the people and defend the false doctrines that his organization teaches the people (and by which he obtains their money), such false doctrines as “purgatory”, “the trinity,” “images,” “immortality of the soul,” “holy water,” and so forth. The honest people of the world are getting their eyes opened, and this is spoiling his pasture.—Jeremiah 25:34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For that reason Felix is howling, just as the Lord said he would howl. Even his howling days are near at an end, because the Lord will clear the earth of every wicked and blasphemous thing and establish His righteous government under Christ Jesus, where all honest and sincere people may dwell together in peace and enjoy liberty and life everlasting. And where will he and his fellow slandering priests be then? Jesus answers, at Matthew 23:33, “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[Gehenna</span><span class="font7"> (Greek)]?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Felix and his fellow priests advise their followers to resort to violence and commit murder. One of them recently said concerning Rutherford, YVe would like to impale him on iron tongs,’ and yet these are the men who claim to represent Christ Jesus, and expect honest people to believe it. Such slandering and libelous priests not only would have Rutherford in prison again if they could, but would have him murdered immediately, except for the protection which the Almighty God furnishes in his behalf.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE Greeks of the Dodecanese islands, occupied by the Italians in 1912, are very much in earnest in their desire to get out from under Italian rule. The Dodecanesian League of America publishes some of the reasons, in each instance referring to specific treatment of prisoners who are named, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To compel them to testify, the Italians refused to give them either food or water for days, while at the same time they were striking them brutally, and every day. Sleep was kept from their suffering eyes by means of needles with which the Italians were puncturing the eyelids of these unlucky creatures. . . . The extraction of the nails of hands and feet with the use of pincers. . . . There the captain of the carabinieri, Gracciani, thrust his finger into the eye of D. Fantenou, and pulled it out. . . . His throat was twisted to such a degree that his larynx was destroyed. Now he breathes with the aid of a tube. . . . One by one the hairs of their mustaches and eyebrows were extracted, their feet placed in boiling water, and their soles were cut into by means of razors. . . . The younger of them died from gangrenous infection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HAT Bible Students have nothing whatever to do with Anarchism, Communism or Bolshevism, the following facts fully substantiate:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370728_files/g_E_19370728-6.png" alt="" style="width:233pt;height:267pt;">
<p><span class="font6">An old European bawd takes out naturalization papers (Beauty is only skin deep)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">With the aid of a Catholic priest by the name of Dr. E. Gorski, a judge in Poland, Zyg-mond Wolski, compiled a brochure entitled “Anarchistic Tendencies of Bible Students”. This brochure was based upon a defamatory article regarding the Bible Students under the title “Bolshevistic Plagues” and which had been published in the largest polish newspaper, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrowany Kurjer Codzienny.</span><span class="font7"> The manager of the branch of the Bible Students in Poland, Wm. Schneider, in Lodz, sued the responsible editor for libel. The Court fined the editor zl.200 and, in addition, made him pay the costs of court, zl.110.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In summing up its arguments the Court pointed out that the editor was guilty of libel against the Bible Students, setting forth that in a certain Bible Students’ meeting purely religious topics were being discussed, including those of a social character in harmony with Christian Idealism. With this verdict the basic charges of the Gorski pamphlet were ruled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of special interest therefore are the conclusions arrived at by the Catholic Church paper, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Gazeta Koscielna</span><span class="font7"> No. 21, of May 21, 1933, in commenting on the above-mentioned pamphlet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It follows therefore that these sectarians cannot be classed in with Communism, for the Bible Students are themselves also opposed to it. In quoting citations from their publications, we must not ignore those which expressly declare that neither Communism nor anarchy can bring happiness to humanity, but that a government based upon a theocratic foundation is necessary to assure a guaranty of peace and happiness. Hence there is a great gulf between Bible Students and Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because the Catholic bishop of Sando-mierz took exception to this truthful and matter-of-fact verdict, the editor of this article, for his own justification, added:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I hope to be understood in the sense that I do not take the position of a defender for the Bible Students, neither does the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Gazeta Koscielna</span><span class="font7"> become their champion; for it is one thing to defend the idea of a sect, and quite another thing to furnish proof that said sect does not advocate such an idea. Since I am familiar with both the idea as well as the spirit of this sect, I herewith declare that the State may rest absolutely at peace from this quarter; because Bible Students will not assume an aggressive character against the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The accusations therefore, raised by several clerics, are without any foundation whatsoever. It merely seems that way to us, because, accustomed as we are to observing the indifference of the majority of Cath-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">olics, we lose sight of the joy of living sacrifice on the part of Bible Students for their propaganda purposes. And we also note that any efforts toward vilifying this sect not only bear no good fruit, but, what is more, are entirely foreign and diametrically opposed and harmful to the idea of the Catholic Church. We pay no attention to the fact that the use of unethical methods indicates a lack of spiritual power and by this means we are turning thousands of sensitive souls away from the Church. It is about time that champions of the truth cease their abuse in their conflict with their opponents, by teaching, not only from their pulpits, but also in very deed, that such also </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WE MUST LOVE.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Conspiracy Against America</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The conspiracy against America is very well set forth in the following dispatch from Seattle, May 29, to the Portland (Oreg.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Journal</span><span class="font7"> of the following day’s date. It remains only to add that this conspiracy is state-wide and worldwide, extending where-ever the Roman Catholic Hierarchy reaches. The plans are unpatriotic, treasonable, shameless and Fascist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new organization that promises to exert a profound influence in local politics is being quietly formed in Seattle and may eventually expand throughout the state. Its purpose is to combat Communism wherever it is found and by whatever method may be necessary. In other words, it is prepared to get tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The organization began in the Knights of Columbus within the past few days and found ready support among members of the American Legion. Already some Protestant clergymen have been interested, together with some prominent Jews. The idea is to make it nonsectarian, non-partisan and aggressively pro-American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The plan of organization, so far carefully guarded and not yet completed, calls for a general federation of groups and individuals aroused by the continued encroachments of radicalism. Inside this, however, will be a core of active men who will actually conduct the campaign and carry out the battle plans and strategy of an executive committee of 12. The identity</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">As they are shaping up, the methods of the new organization will be a combination of Vigilantes, the Secret Six of Chicago fame and the Daughters of the American Revolution. They will carry the flag with a mailed fist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first open step will probably be a combination membership drive and educational campaign to advise the public of the new association and its intentions. Then it will turn actively to the business of making things uncomfortable for Communists. Public officials openly allied with the reds or those who have been sympathetic to their program will come in for attention. So will public school and university teachers who have been skirting the rim of Communism in their classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Red labor agitators are slated for specific action. In fact, there will be lots of action in lots of places if plans mature the way they are laid, because the organizers plan to have plenty of manpower ready for emergencies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The president knows well enough what is going on, but he is not interested in the preservation of America. What he wants is Fascism, like the beautiful (?) arrangements in Italy, Austria, Germany and elsewhere. Among the many papers served on him on this subject was the following interesting letter by Mr. Vartanian. See acknowledgment herewith by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, of the Department of Justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oakland, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jan. 20, 1937 Hon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear President :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I admire the step you have taken to see that a reward from federal funds will be made available to anyone who will give information regarding the kidnaping of the Mattison child. An example that should he followed by all governors in this most shocking case.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">But do you realize, Mr. President, that there are other cases of violence to American justice that are just as unlawful and from a different angle just as much an expression of violence as this kidnaping? </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">refer to the ungodly, unlawful, inhuman, and fanatical violence of that bigoted sect, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, especially in the state of New Jersey and elsewhere. These people acting thru their allied political tools, rulers who do not love true American standards, even in their bigotry inflict punishment upon helpless school children who dare to love their God as well as their country. And, too, consider their cruel and relentless war against those who dare to preach true Christianity instead of some ereedal brand of religion.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Millions have several times signed Protests and Petitions which have been presented to those in authority so that a check might be made on this Fascist foreign influence in American life. So far it seems the wishes of these true. Americans with the free spirit of their ancestors and their love of the true and living God have been disregarded and their efforts seem to be fruitless. Men in responsible positions remain silent on this fundamental issue. Why ? Does some superpower silence the voices of real American statesmen ? If so, why ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Congress of the United States have also a great responsibility to both God and man, yet they show no vision of the will of Jehovah God expressed in the Holy Scriptures; for if they did they would not for a moment leave unchallenged the unfair and intolerant actions of the Roman Hierarchy. Shall they be permitted to control American politics as they have those of Spain and other nations, to the same disastrous end ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why are laws allowed to be passed and enforced that are contrary to the Constitution of this free nation, and of a foreign, Fascist nature? Why are true Christian people persecuted and denied their Godgiven rights in a land of liberty ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a national leader you have a responsibility to show kindness, and protect the rights of Jehovah’s people (Matthew 25th chapter), and by so doing manifest your respect and reverence for the King of Eternity. You can do your share to see that these people are ‘let go, that they may worship and serve Jehovah’ as commanded by Him, in a free and unmolested manner. I have no desire to fight with any religionist leader in any carnal way, but I do speak in the name of Jehovah and His Son, Jesus Christ, whom I follow gladly and in His name call your attention to your responsibility to Him as well as your responsibility towards His human creatures. Kidnaping is a terrible crime and should be severely punished, but so should others be punished for kidnaping the rights of others and doing violence (often actual and physical) to inoffensive Christians.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>As in Germany, So in America</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">As Germany was ruined by the Swastika, the illegal Brown Shirts, and the exsoldiers, so America may be ruined by waving the stars and stripes, while the Knights of Columbus and the American (?) Legion do the dirty work. Jehovah’s witnesses know<sup>7</sup> just how it is done; they have seen the team at work. In Germany the courts act like so many schoolboys, doing what they are told. Is that to be the rule in America?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The common idea is that when a man puts on a black robe, takes his place on the bench, and starts to hand down decisions, decrees and rulings, he is of higher quality than ordinary clay. He appears to speak from Olympian heights and his sayings are supposed to be truth, verity and logic. It’s only a supposition, however. The judicial boys are human, like the rest of us. They make mistakes. They are swayed by prejudice, passion and their own philosophy of life, just like the ordinary fry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Almost two years ago little Carleton Nichols of Lynn, Massachusetts, horrified the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Ku Klux Klan, Silver Shirts, White Shirts, Gray Shirts, Khaki Shirts and other superheated devotees of nationalistic religion by actually refusing to lift his hand in salute to the flag. The Associated Press joined the resulting clamor and in a short space of time Carleton and over a hundred others were kicked out of the public schools and told to get their education out of the atmosphere. In this period a number of cases have been entered in the courts to determine the right of a child to attend the public schools and be free to obey the laws of Almighty God. Now some of the courts have spoken—and how!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Decision Contrary to Stipulation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and Agreement</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370728_files/g_E_19370728-8.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:261pt;">
<p><span class="font6">All aboard for the last trip</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The New Jersey Supreme Court said that the giving of the salute was not in conflict with the religious beliefs of the children. And that, dearly beloveds, is peculiar, because in that case all the parties stipulated and agreed, and wrote it into the record, that the children could not salute the flag because it contravened their Christian beliefs. The Supreme Court did not like the facts; so it amended the facts to fit its decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, after considering the matter for one year and three months, decided that the compulsory flag salute didn’t interfere with freedom of worship. The court also agreed that the boy was telling the truth when he said that he couldn’t salute the flag because “it was not the flag of God”. Yet it solemnly rules that the salute does not infringe the boy’s rights of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Washington County (Pennsylvania) Common Pleas Court took about a year to think about it and hatched out some new ideas. The court ruled that the only thing secured to the people under the constitution in the line of religious freedom was freedom of conscience. You can believe anything you want to, but if your belief collides with a law it’s too bad for the belief. If the state should enact a law requiring you to doff your hat and kiss the large digit on the right foot of each priest you meet, you wouldn’t lose any religious freedom. You would have to give the big toe a royal smack, but your conscience would be free to think all kinds of lurid things about it. This court further held that the refusal of school children to salute the flag was “in violation of their social duties and subversive of good order”. It’s going to be tough on Pennsylvania school kids to be kicked out of school every time they slip up on a social duty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Chief Justice Brownson of this Pennsylvania court did not agree with his judicial colleagues. Here is what he had to say about it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I would say that if any of the children should honestly and sincerely entertain religious scruples against taking such a pledge, I question whether they ought to be compelled thus to violate their consciences, even if such scruples be deemed unreasonable. No good purpose is subserved thereby. To compel them to utter a personal pledge which they cannot give from the heart, because they conscientiously believe it a violation of their duty to God, is to inculcate hypocrisy, and to weaken the conception and sense of supremacy of conscience, not only in themselves, but among others. There are, it is true, some things which the law may properly command a man to do, or refrain from doing, even against the dictates of conscience, but those are things touching and involving the safety and welfare of society or the rights of his fellow citizens, and they come under the doctrine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Solus populi est supremo, lex”. 1</span><span class="font7"> am unable to see that the safety and welfare of the country and its people will be en-dangercd by the fact that a few school children may be unwilling, in consequence of their conscientiously held religious tenets, to join with others in uttering a prescribed form of an express pledge of allegiance, or that forcing them thus to play the hypocrite will in any way benefit the country. . . . [To stand mute] wouldn’t hurt the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Peter J. Shields, of the Superior Court of Sacramento, California, in a similar case holds that the school child may have the right to attend school even though he does fail to perform his “social duty” of saluting the flag. Judge Shields states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are not to be the judges of the reasonableness of another’s beliefs, nor the merits of his religious convictions. The Constitution says that we may exercise our religious convictions without discrimination or preference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Georgia Supreme Court did well at pronouncing the solemn rulings involving freedom of worship and then heaving them into the ash can. The court called attention to the fact that Georgia children have a constitutional right to attend the public schools. It quoted citations pronouncing the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, and that no human authority could of right interfere with it. Then the court proceeded to remove both such rights from Dorothy Leoles, who believed in the inherent right to worship God without bowing down to the national image. It decided she could not worship God “in spirit and in truth” if she attended the public schools of Georgia and that the compulsory flag salute just didn’t interfere with her freedom of worship. And the proud motto of the State of Georgia is, “Wisdom, Justice, Moderation.” Phooey!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>The Workmanship of Master Bunglers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Isn’t it wonderful how the courts can muddy up a simple, clear-cut proposition? Religious freedom means the right to believe, and the right to act in accordance with the belief. Apply ordinary reasoning (not the judicial variety) to the proposition, without taking a year or two to make it difficult, and what have you? The school child has the right to believe that a salute to the flag is a violation of God’s law. He has the right to act in accordance with such belief, which means he has the right to refuse to salute the flag. But that is too simple and easy for those who wear the ermine. When they get through you have all these contradictions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It doesn’t violate the rights of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It does violate the rights of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It won’t hurt the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is subversive of the social order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is violative of a social duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We cannot decide another person’s religious beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flag salute has nothing to do with a religious belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, there you are. Consistency, truth and logic fly out of the window when the devotees of the flag-salutin’ religion endeavor to justify their position. Justice receives a kick in the slats, and Ambrose improves in health. And the people still believe that Christianity is free in America.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>All Set to Grab the Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The people at Washington who have sworn to preserve and protect the Government are all set to grab it the day the United States enters a war, and it is easy enough to get into a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Morgan gang were so absolutely sure that they could force the United States into the World War that two representatives of that buccaneering outfit, Sharp and Bacon, waited cm Gabriel Hanotaux, France’s wartime minister of foreign affairs, in company with the late Myron T. Herrick, United States ambassador to France, and solemnly guaranteed to put the United States into the war on the side of the Morgan financial interests, if France, which was then licked, would stay in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Did they keep their word? You ought to know that they did, and that the mandate of the American people to Mr. Wilson to keep out of the war had no more weight with that gentleman than the morning dew has on the hide of the rhinoceros. Hanotaux gave it all away in his Memoirs. And the purchased American newspapers delivered the Morgan goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But now about grabbing the Government outright, and having in America this bastard form of tyranny styled Fascism, more properly designated Catholic Action. It will all be done, if nothing comes up to prevent it, just as easily as the pirate Sir Henry John Morgan ever sacked a city. The army and navy have the plans all worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day war is declared the powers of the military dictatorship which will then be declared give the president absolute powers, covering everything. He will fix prices, rates and wages and can immediately suppress any newspaper, printing press, publishing firm, or any other business or any individual in a position to influence or appeal to public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Warm times ahead, boys and girls! Take your choice: Jehovah or the Devil! “Choose you this day whom ye will serve!” Choose life, that you may live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of President Roosevelt’s secretaries is Miss Grace G. Tully, who was secretary to Cardinal Hayes of New York for ten years before the campaign of 1928, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected governor of New York, at which time she began to work for him. President Roosevelt betrays no prejudice against Catholics. Some of his closest and most confidential colaborers are subjects of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another of his Roman Catholic secretaries, Miss Grace Le Hand, was recently given the degree of LL.D. It was conferred in the White House, with the president of the United States sitting beside two nuns, shown in a picture blazoned all over the United States.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Putting It Up to Dickstein</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Noticing that Representative Samuel Dickstein, of New York city, stated in Washington that there are 800 “Hate” organizations in the United States, Harry Piatt of New Jersey suggested in a letter to him that it is just possible there is an organization in the United States that would find pleasure in applying that epithet to any and every body of people in the country that might be interested in the subject of preserving their liberties and that of others:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The situation in Italy, Germany and Spain should furnish a definite clue as to the organization which you may expect to find interested in the strangulation of liberty in this country. In both Italy and Germany the Jew is severely persecuted and every Christian who holds a belief differing from that of the State religion is likely to be thrown into a detention camp or a dungeon where he will be starved or beaten in an attempt to force him to change his belief. This same condition has recently evidenced itself in this country also. In Spain, where a popular government is or was in power and a State religion forced out, a revolution is now in full swing in an attempt to force out by violence the government of the people’s choice and jam down their throats the State religion which they by the ballot have vomited up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everyone with an iota of intelligence knows that the mother of the twins Fascism and Nazism is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Also, every such person knows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her twins do not thrive well where democracy, education and truth have free way. This subtle organization by deceptive influence over finance, commerce and politics has set out to undermine this government, and thus far, unhindered, has made a pretty good job of it. Laws have been enacted which make it a misdemeanor if you dare open your mouth to reveal insidiousness of this, the incubator of all “hate organizations”. Boycott has been openly advocated by the Hierarchy against commercial organizations which rent radio facilities. Bodily injury and death has been threatened time and again by agents of this organization against anyone who would dare reveal its wicked activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where is the public-spirited and constitutionally conscious statesman? What! With flagrant defiance of the bill of rights and basic tenets of this government flung so brazenly in their faces, and not a voice is raised in protest which can be heard above a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men, women and children, highly respectable, are thrown into filthy jails in various parts of this country because they preach the gospel of God’s kingdom and it is highly distasteful to the Hierarchy.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>The Mussolini-Hitler Brand of Anarchy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE cat is now well out of the bag that the Roman Hierarchy and its K. of C. strongarm squad are out and out for Fascism, which is the opposite of democracy. The new emblem of the K. of C. which every member of the order is urged to wear, has the Fascist emblem as its central feature. The cross is tipped to one side to bring this more prominently to the fore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an address at Providence, Rhode Island, the Most Reverend Francis P. Keogh said, “Should it develop into a fight between Communism and Fascism, we’ll take Fascism, because the Fascists have a god.” Why, sure he would! and so would every other bishop. This sentence, in one form or another, has been in so many addresses of Roman prelates in the past year that it may as well stand in type, and be run in every address they give. The Fascists have a god; of course, they have. It is the same god Jesus and the apostle spoke about, the god of this world, the Devil, whose personal representative on this earth is the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bishop Joseph Schrembs, of Cleveland, Ohio, in endorsing Father Coughlin and Fascism puts the two together in this fashion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Father Coughlin wants some protection for the laboring classes and their families. Fascism has now given it to Italian workmen. If American capitalists were not so shortsighted they would also advance in order to save their country from Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hierarchy has not a particle of respect for the United States flag, or any other flag, except as a convenient way of clubbing its way into power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post,</span><span class="font7"> in its issue of December 12, 1936, republished from the European Picture Service of the Paul Thompson Photos a picture of seven men on a reviewing stand in Trenton when the national flag went by. Governor (later President) Wilson, and all the men but one, had their hats off when the flag went by. Joseph Tumulty, President Wilson’s Roman Catholic secretary, kept his hat squarely on his head and did not even touch its brim. A correspondent wants to know what was the matter with Tumulty’s hat. It is easy enough. At that time he was acting as he really felt.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>The Greatest Disgrace in History</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font7">OTHING in history ever equaled the great disgrace to which the Roman Catholic organization is exposed by what is happening in Germany. White with rage, Dr. Joseph Goebbels, German minister of propaganda, said of the public trials for corruption of youths by Roman Catholic priests and lay brothers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The situation in Germany is not a case of individual acts, but of a general decadence of morals more shocking than anything that can be observed in the entire history of humanity. If you ask why trials of similar offenders in other walks of life are not public, I reply, because no other calling or profession hitherto has presumed to condone such swinish conduct, and because in no other calling has immorality been so rampant as among those under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In every case the Church has sought to protect the accused, obscure their offenses and either transfer them to some other monastery or smuggle them abroad in order that they might escape the arm of the law. In full knowledge of all that has happened in this connection and of all that has come to my notice through examination of records, I desire to state that the magnitude of these monstrous offenses cannot be communicated to the German people to their full extent. This cesspool is so abysmal that every person who had an opportunity to attend only one of these trials would be imbued with immeasurable wrath and holy anger. For there can today unfortunately be no doubt that even with the thousands upon thousands of cases that have come to the knowledge of justice, these are only a fraction of the real extent of this moral chaos and only a symptom of the whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The seduced victims were rewarded for compliance with the wishes of sexual criminals by gifts and pictures of the saints. After their defilement, the sign of the cross was made on the youths and blessings shed on them. No place sacred to the faithful remained free from desecration by criminals in the garb of priests. These unnatural practices were carried on behind the altar, between communion and confession. Certain priests exacted obedience from youths by telling them that such relation with a priest is no sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who have been found out should not call on God. God’s mercy is not for such people. No one can sink that deep without having lost all relations with Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I speak here as a German National Socialist, as the father of a family whose most valuable personal earthly possessions are his four children, whose education he must entrust to public instruction when they reach the proper age. As such I can understand the feelings of those parents who have seen their children, their most precious possession, delivered to bestial and unscrupulous defilers of youth. I believe too that I speak in the name of thousands of German parents who think with fear and disgust that their own innocent children might sometime be morally and physically corrupted in this way by conscienceless seducers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is therefore very unwise and demonstrates the complete panic of these circles, which find themselves exposed, when they attempt to throw doubt upon the reports of the trials by appealing to the uninformed outside world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Experienced in Care of Feeble-Minded</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">E</span><span class="font7">VERY American must have noticed the frequency with which public charges of all kinds aro placed in Roman Catholic institutions. The government aid for their upkeep is an important source of Roman Catholic revenue. Now about the caretakers in such institutions! If they run short they know where to get them. Here, for instance, is Brother Friedrich of the Waldbreitbach Franciscans, at Oberbruchanau, Germany. Just at present he is nominally serving a three-year sentence for offenses against six feeble-minded and insane patients in his care, but no doubt he can be released and shipped to the United States right away under one of the Jesuit-forged passports, if he is really needed. Another bird that got four years is Brother Januarius of the Montabaur Brothers of Charity: thirteen boys under 18 appeared against him. Nice kind of caretaker for boys, eh? what?</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. Charles H. Herty, who several years ago perfected a process for making newsprint paper from Southern pine trees, has made another important discovery which undoubtedly will have an effect on the making of papers. According to an announcement made by the pulp and paper laboratory located in Savannah, Georgia, Doctor Herty has been seeking a way to make book and bond papers, also clothing, from the pine trees in the huge forests of the South. His research and experiments resulted in his discovery of fat in the woody part of the trees, also an easy as well as inexpensive method for extracting it. This discovery of the fat in the trees, it is said, will make the trees of the South immediately available for the unlimited manufacture of the finest bond and book papers. Also, if rayon can be made from the trees, the same as it is now made from the Northern spruce, the South has enough pine to clothe the whole world in rayon. Doctor Herty has said the discovery of the fat offers a new industry to the manufacture of newsprint; for he found the same fat in spruce trees, from which the world’s present supply of newsprint, also most of its white paper, is made.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE word “key”, as used in the Scriptures, means the privilege of unlocking, disclosing and making known certain truths concerning the kingdom of heaven. Jesus says that such is the proper meaning of the word as here used. It was the duty of the Jewish priests to make known to the people the contents of the Scriptures. Instead </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of the commandments of God </span><span class="font7">those clergy substituted the teachings of men, and to them Jesus said: “Ye have taken away the key of knowledge.”—Luke 11: 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It pleased God to withhold the knowledge of the kingdom of heaven and keep it a mystery </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">until </span><span class="font7">after the coming of Christ Jesus, as it is written: ‘The mystery [of the kingdom of heaven] which was hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to the saints.’ (Colos-sians 1: 26,27) It was to the saints the apostles that the Lord revealed the fact that the kingdom of heaven consists of Christ Jesus, the chief foundation Rock and Head, together with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">144,000 </span><span class="font7">members of His body. (Ephesians </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1:</span><span class="font7">20-23; Revelation 7:4) Our Lord did not re</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">veal </span><span class="font7">this to His disciples until after His ascension into heaven. After they received the holy spirit at Pentecost, then they began to under</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">stand. </span><span class="font7">Prior to that time even the apostles expected the Lord to set up a kingdom entirely with the people of Israel. Before the ascension of Christ He was with His disciples and “when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? and he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the holy [spirit] is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth”.—Acts 1: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus spoke the word “keys” in the plural (Matthew 16:19), showing that He meant more than one key. Following the gift of the holy spirit at Pentecost Peter, by the grace of the Lord, was permitted to use the first of these keys by unlocking and making known God’s purposes to select from the Jews some of those who should be made members of the kingdom of heaven. That gospel of Christ Jesus was preached exclusively to the Jews for three and one-half years, and from the Jews the Lord selected a remnant. At the end of that time the Lord handed to Peter the other “key”, by which he unlocked and made known to the non-Jews that from amongst them God would select some who should be made members of the kingdom of heaven. This account is stated fully in the tenth chapter of The Acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cornelius, a Gentile, prayed and sought to know the Lord, and the Lord sent him to Peter. And then Cornelius told Peter of a vision and a message that he had received from the Lord. Up to that time Peter did not know the meaning of the second “key” the Lord had given him; but now the Lord revealed to him the meaning thereof, showing how the gospel was to go to the Gentiles as well as the Jews: “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”—Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The privilege of the kingdom of heaven was then opened to the Gentiles, as well as the Jews. Later Peter so informed his fellow disciples, when he said to them at Jerusalem that God had also visited the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name. (Acts 15:14) The two “keys” had then been used by Peter to uidock and make known to others the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, that is, that God would take out a “remnant” of the Jews, and some from the Gentiles, who together constitute the heavenly kingdom or church. The use of the “keys” by Peter as he had been commissioned was then and there completed, and no other man could possibly be successor of Peter in doing a work already completed. This conclusively proves that no one succeeded Peter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But what of the words of Jesus to Peter, “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven”? The clear and undoubted meaning thereof is that Jesus promised to confirm the acts of Peter in using the keys and that He did fully confirm and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">approve the same. Such confirmation was absolutely necessary because Peter could act only by authority from the Lord. These words’ being spoken in connection with the keys show that the Lord agreed to approve what Peter did with the keys, and not what he should do with reference to other matters. Not one word is said about Peter’s having a successor and that his action should be confirmed by the Lord.</span></p>

To make this trip one must travel 5,366 miles and almost cross the continent twice. It takes 11½ days. Distances in Australia are nearly as great. The railway line from Freemantle, West Australia, to Cairns, Queensland, is 4,420 miles long. This is over a thousand miles longer than the distance from New York to San Francisco, and gives one some idea of the vast distances in the island continent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">THE death of the queen of Belgium was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-L </span><span class="font7">caused by a curb eight inches high, intended to prevent automobiles from running off the road and into Lake Lucerne. In every hundred feet, for some reason unknown, eighteen feet were left curbless. In one of these spaces two wheels ran outside the curb, the car going 55 miles an hour. The curb prevented the car from getting back on the road. After going 95 feet with two wheels over the curb, the top of the car hit a tree, which threw the queen out and against the tree and caused her death. The king received a fractured rib. The car itself was but slightly damaged. It is inconceivable that when God’s kingdom is in full operation speeds of 55 miles an hour on ordinary highways will be permitted. No one has a right to expose himself or others to the risks which every year take over 30,000 lives in the United States. Why all the rush to make the cemetery ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I have just a few days back had the opportunity of going back to Bobtown, Pennsylvania, and went back to the chief of police and asked permission to again operate the sound car. The man whom I contacted was the same man who was chief when I met him three months previously, while engaged in sound-car work there. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font7">informs me that he has been chief there for seven years straight and has never been discharged for any reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He did say, however, that there was a policeman in Bobtown that had been discharged a little more than a year ago, but not because of religious activity. It may be that the policeman they discharged is the one my informants there in Bobtown were referring to, and they gave me to understand he was the chief. That statement was incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The present chief of police I have had opportunity to contact twice. Both times he gave us permission to operate, and is a very sensible man, and has always treated us with utmost decency and courtesy; so I promised him </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">would write </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> and ask them to correct the statement.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark223"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>About the Brothers and Sisters of Jesus</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">R</span><span class="font7">ECENTLY there appeared, in the Chicago </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font7"> an article in which incidental reference was made to the brothers and sisters of Jesus, the sons and daughters of Mary. This statement, according to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the Catholic press, was an insult, a “slander” of Mary. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> of April 17 said, “Catholics of Chicago were incensed” because of the publication of this Scriptural truth. In times gone by the writer of the article as well as the publishers would have been thrown into prison for “heresy”. As it was, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font7"> apologized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having established a censorship over motion pictures, the Hierarchy is now doubtless well on the way toward a more rigid censorship of papers and periodicals. The foregoing is a case in point, as is also the “retraction” by “Peter Whiffen”, who wrote the article “A Priest Warns the Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures speak definitely of the brethren and sisters of Jesus. On one occasion “his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him”. On another, His acquaintances asked, “Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us [at Nazareth] ?” (Matthew 12:46; 13: 55, 56) Similar statements are found at Mark 3: 31, 32; 6:3; and Luke 8:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After Jesus’ resurrection and while waiting for the outpouring of the holy spirit Jesus’ mother and His brethren were in the upper room with the apostles and other believers in their assemblies there. Mary’s name is so closely linked with the mention of Jesus’ brothers and sisters as to show a family relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic Hierarchy claim that these brothers and sisters simply were cousins of Jesus, the children of Mary, wife of Cleophas. This Mary is referred to in Scripture as the sister of Jesus’ mother, but was doubtless such by marriage, otherwise she would not have borne the same name. This Mary had sons bearing names similar to those borne by some of Jesus’ brothers, which is not unusual among cousins. Some of these cousins of Jesus were His followers, but His brethren, at first, did not believe in Him.—John 7: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that sisters are mentioned in the same connection in almost each case indicates</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">that they and the ‘&quot;brethren” were all members of one family. The word “sisters” could not properly be applied to cousins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus moved from Nazareth to Capernaum He likewise arranged for His mother, brothers and sisters to go there to live, while Mary the wife of Alpheus (or Cleophas) is not mentioned, as she certainly would have been had she been part of the family group and the children hers rather than those of Mary the mother of Jesus.—Matthew 4:13; John 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Son, Behold Thy Mother*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that Jesus committed His mother to John’s care shortly before He died on the tree does not necessarily prove that He had no brothers or sisters. These may not have been in position to care for her, and, in any event, they were not at the scene of His crucifixion and could not therefore give Mary the care which then seemed necessary.—John 19:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Vol. IV, page 753, gives some illuminating comments on the subject under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is the term “brother” (dSeXcpbg) to be taken in the proper sense, or in the general signification of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">kinsman, </span><span class="font7">in these texts? The use of the title in the last two passages, as well as in John 2:12; Matthew 12:46-50; Mark 3: 31-35; Luke 8:19-21; Acts 1:14, in explicit connection with his mother, and in relations which imply that they were members of his immediate family, most naturally requires it to be taken in its literal sense, especially as no intimation is elsewhere conveyed to the contrary. . . . Nor can the term “sisters” (dSeAqpai), employed in the same connection (Matthew 13:56; Mark 6:3), be referred to other than uterine relatives. This inference is sustained by the striking coincidence in the names of the brothers in the list of the apostles (namely, James, Judas, and apparently Simon, Luke 6:15,16; Acts 1:13) with those in reference to Christ’s brothers (namely, James, Judas, Simon, and Joses, Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3), and also by the fact that “James the Less and Joses” are said to be the sons of the same Mary who was “the wife of Cleophas” (Mark 15:40; and Matthew 27:56; compare with John 19:25).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Evidently the desire to deify Mary, in all practical aspects, even though this is denied in theory, has caused Catholic theologians to insist that she was “for ever virgin”. A distinction is made between the honor rendered to God and that given to Mary. God is worshiped, say the theologians, with “latria”, while Mary is hon-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">700</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">ored or adored with “hyperdulia” as distinguished from “dulia”, the worship directed toward all the saints. These nice distinctions do not, of course, sink in very deeply in the minds of the ordinary Catholic, who in many instances thinks of Mary more highly than of Jesus or Jehovah, and thinks that because she is a woman she can be more easily imposed upon. One of the favorite prayers is, “Remember, 0 most Holy Virgin Mary, that no one ever had recourse to your protection, implored your help, or sought your mediation without obtaining relief.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>Queen of Heaven and Hell?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Hierarchy insist upon the adoration or worship of the virgin Mary. Liguori says, among many other extravagant things, that Mary is Queen of Mercy; the mother of all mankind, and especially of repentant sinners; that God reconciled sinners by the humility and purity of Mary; that she is the Protectress of Catholics at the hour of death; that she is the Hope, the Refuge, the Help, the Asylum of all; the Comfortress of the world, the one City of Refuge; that she withholds God’s arm from chastising sinners; that they that call on the name of Mary are heard more quickly than those who call on the name of Jesus; that she is Queen of heaven and hell, of all saints, and all evil spirits, because she conquered the latter by her virtues, and the Devil by her fair humility and holy life; that at the name of Mary every knee bows and hell trembles; that she is the Ladder of paradise, the Gate of heaven, the most true Mediatrix of grace; that in her is all hope of life and virtue, all grace of the Way and Truth; that in her is found eternal salvation, that no one can enter heaven except by her; that God says “Go to Mary” when one seeks for grace; that the other saints intercede with her; that all power is given to her in heaven and earth; that God himself obeys the command of Mary; that Mary is omnipotent; that she has the key of the gate to paradise; that she is the Throne of grace to which Paul directs us; and that all who invoke the holy name of Mary with confidence shall reach the glory of paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same author, in the same book, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Glories of Mary,</span><span class="font7"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That which we intend to prove here is that the intercession of Mary is now </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font7"> to salvation; we say necessary—not absolutely, but morally. This necessity proceeds from the will itself of God that all graces that he dispenses should pass by the hands of Mary, according to the opinion of S. Bernard, and which we may now with safety call the general opinion of theologians and learned men. The author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Reign of Mary</span><span class="font7"> positively asserts that such is the case. It is maintained by Vega, Mendoza, Pacciuchelli, Segnori, Poire, Crasset, and by innumerable other learned authors. (See McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia, </span><span class="font7">Vol. V, pages 748, 749.)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>“The Handmaid of the Lord”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">From the foregoing Romanist teaching it is evident that they transfer to Mary everything that has been said in Scripture concerning Jesus Christ, and in some instances go so far as to imply that Mary runs heaven as some virago or Xanthippe, so that even God himself submits to her whims. Could blasphemy go further? How different this from the obedience which the faithful Mary displayed when she said “Behold the Lord’s handmaid” and which the faithful Son of God has always manifested and will continue to manifest as He administers His kingdom in harmony with Jehovah’s will, and finally delivers it up to Jehovah to be subject unto Him that put all things under His control, that Jehovah may be all in all!—1 Corinthians 15: 22-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It becomes evident that the perpetual virginity of Mary is insisted upon by Rome to bolster up its warped teachings concerning her position. Motherhood, in the estimation of sane men, and also according to the Holy Scriptures, is no disgrace, and is entirely compatible with sanctity and purity. Mary was holy because she was entirely devoted to the doing of Jehovah’s will. The difficulty has been that men have rejected the testimony of witnesses chosen of God, and whose testimony is recorded in the Scriptures, and have accepted instead what presumptuous and Scripturally uninformed men have said, men who lived centuries after the event occurred about which they presume to speak. Thus, in preference to the testimony of contemporaries, the guesses of prejudiced men are accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whether it was the desire to produce for “Christians” a “goddess” as “pure” and imposing as the heathen Diana, or whether it was from a warped conception of the holiness of “virginity”, the church fathers of the fifth century pushed Mary to the fore as a virgin of superlative holiness, and gradually she came to occupy a place more important than that of Jesus in the minds of many Catholics. In this we see the work of Satan, who has sought by every means at his disposal to misrepresent or distort the work and position of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and the Ransomer of mankind. Necessarily His position is obscured, and often eclipsed, by the honor given to the “virgin”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>True and False Celibacy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">All this unnatural honor accorded virginity is an implied slur upon parenthood. The subjects of the Hierarchy are continually subjected to misleading sophistry on this point, so that marriage, though considered a sacrament, is not very highly esteemed. It is generally held among them that at least one daughter out of every family should be given “to the church”. Many of these candidates for virginity are committed to cloister prisons from which they never again come forth. There, in many if not in all instances, they serve the purposes of celibate priests, and for a show make many prayers, which rise no higher than the ceiling, unless it be the agonized prayers of some who, realizing that they have been trapped, resist the efforts made to violate their chastity, and who suffer a heroic martyrdom for their sincerity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many Catholics are getting their eyes open, however, and realize that there is nothing wrong with motherhood and fatherhood, and that it is no slander to admit that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also the mother of those who are referred to as His brethren and His sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Celibacy, in the Scriptures, is recommended only for those who can maintain such a standard, and then for the practical reason that it will enable one to give full time to God’s service as a witness to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The stress which the Roman Hierarchy has laid upon formal celibacy has led to untold evils, as past and present events amply prove. Catholic and Protestant writers have written on the subject and proved that enforced celibacy has led to gross immorality on the part of priests, monks, nuns, and others, and has in many instances involved the so-called “laity”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>“Honorable in All”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures, on the other hand, while commending true celibacy, declare, “Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.” (Hebrews 13: 4) No man has the right to forbid another to marry, and to condone unchastity in those who profess celibacy, as is done in the Roman organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be seen that the claim that Mary had no natural children is of a piece with the entire Romish conception of what is true holiness. It has led to the practical deification of a creature, which creature they have invested with fictitious virtues. Mary was, unquestionably, eminently holy in the Scriptural sense of the term. This, however, did not preclude her from discharging her proper duties as a wife and mother. Nor does it mean that Mary was “conceived without sin”. There is nothing in the Scripture that would for a moment justify such a conclusion; nor was it needful that Mary should be immaculate in order to be the mother of Jesus. If such were the case, it would be equally necessary for Mary’s mother to be immaculate in order to bring forth the “immaculate virgin”, and so on back to Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is rank heresy to refer to Mary as the spouse of the Eternal Father. The claim that the angels sing to her, “Holy, holy, holy, Mary Mother of God,” is equally blasphemous. Any Scriptural passage in which Mary is mentioned, from the salutation of the angel to the last mention of her in the book of The Acts, shows clearly that Mary held no such place in the early church as is claimed for her by the Catholic organization.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark233"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>Exaltation of “the Virgin”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Nor is the worship of the “Blessed Virgin” merely due to misunderstanding on the part of certain members of the Catholic church. It is inculcated by the head of the Catholic church, and popes have on various occasions exhorted the Catholic population to give Mary such veneration as can be construed only to be worship due to God only. A few examples follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gregory XVI said, “That all may have a successful and happy issue, let us raise our eyes to the most Blessed Virgin Mary, who alone destroys heresies, who is our greatest hope, yea, the entire ground of our hope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pius IX said, “Let all the children of the Catholic Church most dear to us hear these words; and, with a most ardent zeal of piety and love, proceed to worship, invoke, and pray to the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, conceived without original sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pius XI said, addressing all mankind, “Every</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">one . . </span><span class="font7">. must turn their eyes and minds to the immaculate and sorrowful Mother.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The month of May is designated by the Roman Church as the “month of Mary”, during which she is specially honored. This month derives its name from Maia, a heathen goddess, the wife of a heathen deity. It is interesting to note that the second Sunday in this month has been designated “Mother’s Day”, thus playing nicely into the hands of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In countries where the Bible has had wide circulation the worship of Mary is toned down considerably, but she has, nevertheless, a sidealtar, in practically every Catholic church; thus implying that she is a secondary deity, at the very least. In wholly Catholic countries she is, to all intents and purposes, given first place, and the larger number of churches and cathedrals are dedicated to Mary. God is definitely pushed into the background, while Jesus Christ is honored, more or less, because He was Mary’s Son!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Resentment at the thought that Mary had children other than Jesus is an implied slur upon motherhood. The Scriptures are reasonable, harmonious, truthful. They indulge in no extravagant exaltation of Mary, though they show her to be the admittedly noble instrument which Jehovah was pleased to use in order that the Word might be made flesh.—John 1:14; Galatians 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Explanation (?) of Indulgences</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Zealand Tablet</span><span class="font7"> explains (?) indulgences as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us suppose that a child behaved badly and was sent to bed and forbidden to have any tea by its father as a punishment. Now the soft-hearted mother, when dad goes out to buy the paper, takes the child something to eat and drink quickly whilst he is away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “explanation” does not “explain” that the severe father who has the discipline of his home upset is “god” and the indulgent mother who makes a fool of him is Mary. The reader finds that out afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Felix “O.S.B.” Makes a Lot of Noise</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">VERY interesting article in this issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> that many of your friends may want to read is about Felix. He is trying to get into the limelight. It is very interesting to note that Catholics who are supposed to have “all the wisdom in the world” can’t meet Judge Rutherford in an open debate and prove definitely to the satisfaction of millions of people that Judge Rutherford is ‘wrong’ when he disproves the doctrines of “purgatory”, “trinity,” use of images, and many other doctrines of the Catholic organization. Defenders of Catholic religion haven’t a leg to stand on, because they don’t preach the Bible. Judge Rutherford does. They have a religion which is based on the traditions of men, not the Bible. So they have to dig up something that they think will</span></p>
