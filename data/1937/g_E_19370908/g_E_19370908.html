<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Poisons Formed by Aluminum Cooking Utensils</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By H. J. Force, Ph.G<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark54">1</a></sup> (Scranton, Pa.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">LUMINUM is an element, just the same as iron, lead or gold. In other words, it is not composed of any other elements or substances. Most of the aluminum cooking utensils are nearly pure aluminum. The question is, How does it affect our health when used for general cooking purposes? Health is your most important consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From a chemical standpoint, aluminum and lead are similar in many respects. Rub your fingers over aluminum and they become blackened. Lead produces the same result. Some of the Materia Medicas state that the action of aluminum and lead are similar on living organisms.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370908_files/g_E_19370908-2.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:293pt;">
<p><span class="font5">'‘A.M.A. ”—Aluminum Manufacturers’ Associates</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">People often say that they have used aluminum for years and it has not poisoned them. Many people have taken large doses of various poisons, trying to commit suicide, but in some cases the poisons did not produce death. Nevertheless, they were poisonous compounds just the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Various books on medicine and the U. S. Dispensatory state that arsenic, mercury, carbolic acid, oxalic acid, aluminum, lead, strychnine, etc., are poisonous. None of these recommendations as to their poisonous properties would be questioned in a court at law, although many will admit they have serious stomach trouble, often ulcers of the stomach, cancers, liver troubles, skin affections, etc. Most of these conditions improve when aluminum ware is discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A friend of mine, after having 17 carbuncles, threw out his fancy aluminum ware. The carbuncles disappeared. Another fed his dog from an aluminum dish; the dog died from a cancer of the face. Two others each gave a dozen young ducks water in aluminum pans and all the ducks died in less than two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There have been so many cases where people have been so much improved when they have discarded their aluminum ware that the question as to its use should be given most serious consideration. I do not claim that everyone who uses aluminum utensils will be poisoned. Neither is everyone poisoned by poison oak or poison ivy, yet it would be foolish for anyone to state that they are not poisonous because some are not affected by these poisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But aluminum is different. It acts more in the nature of a cumulative poison. In a number of cases where people have died under hospital care and where aluminum was used almost exclusively, autopsies have shown that aluminum was present in the brain, kidneys and liver in</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">sufficient quantity, in my judgment, to cause death.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Ideal Embalming Fluid</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">The combination of aluminum chloride with aluminum acetate would make an ideal disinfectant and embalming fluid. This combination could easily be brought about by adding salt to pickles when they are prepared in aluminum. Aluminum chloride compounds will be formed when vegetables are cooked in aluminum to which a small quantity of salt (chemically called sodium chloride) has been added. Many natural waters contain quite a little salt. It is evident that when such waters are used when cooking in aluminum, aluminum chloride will be formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been shown that aluminum compounds precipitate or destroy pepsin, which is the principal ingredient in digestion. Alum is a compound of aluminum, potash, sulphur and oxygen, together with a small portion of water, and has the chemical formula Al K (SO«)<sub>2</sub>-12H<sub>2</sub>O. When vegetables are cooked in aluminum vessels, they often contain such compounds as sulphur, potash or soda, which could easily combine with the aluminum, forming small quantities of alum, also aluminum sulphate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many drinking waters through the United States are very hard, containing a large portion of sulphur compounds, also potash and soda. In fact, some waters which I have analyzed became alkaline on boiling. As potash and soda very readily dissolve aluminum, forming a compound similar to alum in its composition, it follows that this compound will be formed if aluminum utensils are used for any length of time to cook food products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sauerkraut, when cooked in aluminum, will produce aluminum chloride, especially if allowed to stand for some time. Many cases of poisoning have resulted from eating sauerkraut cooked in aluminum, and some deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Alum and the various compounds contain a large percent of aluminum, in most cases in soluble form which can readily be absorbed in the stomach or the intestines, and may seriously affect the kidneys and liver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When aluminum cooking utensils are used, there is always some aluminum dissolved. The amount will depend upon the kind of water used. At picnics, church suppers and other places where large numbers are served, the foods are often allowed to stand for some time in aluminum. As a result we often read in the newspapers of numbers of people being stricken ill very soon after eating, probably poisoned from the aluminum compounds formed, and death often following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">People often say they like aluminum, as foods do not burn when cooked in such utensils. The reason is that some aluminum is always dissolving, forming hydrogen gas, and so pushing the foods away from the aluminum. The same thing applies to an aluminum griddle. Salt and soda are generally used in the batter, and these increase the solubility of the aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Large doses of aluminum compounds are often fatal. Small quantities may be taken daily with little or no effect. But sooner or later, indigestion, constipation, Bright’s disease, or diabetes may develop as a result of the continued use of aluminum ware, due to its solubility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To show the solubility of aluminum, make the following simple test for yourself: Place in a well cleaned and scoured aluminum utensil one quart of water, one teaspoon of salt and one of baking soda, and let boil for one hour, adding water to make up the loss. Then remove from the fire and let stand for two or three hours; then pour into a glass jar, and notice the milky condition caused by aluminum hydroxide. This will settle out in a day or so, but its presence is proof that aluminum is soluble.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>What Textbooks Say</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Let us see what textbooks, such as are used in our medical colleges, say about aluminum. Take the Materia Medica, Therapeutics and Pharmacology, for example, by Alexander L. Blackwood, A.B., M.D., F.A.C.P., professor of clinical medicine and therapeutics in the Hahnemann Medical College, Chicago. On page 111 of this volume, we find under “Alum” the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Physiological Action. This agent is actively astringent, coagulating the albumen of the tissues and of the blood, and produces a local constriction of the capillaries. It is mildly escharotic and produces a hardening of the skin and tissues in general. It excites and later diminishes the salivary secretions as well as those of the mucous surfaces; it diminishes the gastric fluid and precipitates pepsin. As a result of its action on the intestinal sections, constipation is produced. Through its irritating properties, which may be in excess of its astringent properties, gastroenteritis may result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On page 112 in the same book, under “Aluminum Hydroxide” the following statement is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Physiological Action. This agent produces profound prostration with irritation of the mucous membranes with diminished secretions, and as a result there is constipation and inactivity of the bowels. The nervous system is affected as is indicated by the extreme prostration with numbness of the parts and paralysis of the involuntary muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To make the above clearer, we give the definitions of a few of the words mentioned:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Astringent. A medicine which causes contraction of the tissues and arrests the flow of secretions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Coagulation. Changing to a curd-like mass; becoming clotted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Escharotic. A substance which burns and destroys the life of the parts to which it is applied.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370908_files/g_E_19370908-3.png" alt="" style="width:234pt;height:267pt;">
<p><span class="font5">All aboard—for the tomb!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The coagulating of the albumen of the tissues and the blood is characteristic of most poisons, and would result in death. Such a condition could cause paralysis, insanity, cancer, rheumatism, neuritis, indigestion, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, some forms of skin diseases, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In God’s holy Word, the Bible, it states (Deuteronomy 12:23): “Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If your blood, which is your life, is being poisoned the above condition is easily accounted for, and you are in danger of not only infection, but various diseases. The Bible is our only Authority as to life, and can be depended upon to state the facts.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>The Nation Is Being Poisoned</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">From the Dispensatory and various Materia Medicas, it is apparent that the nation is being poisoned. There never was so much sickness and complaining, never so much stomach disorder, etc. Cancer has jumped from the tenth place to the second place as the cause of death in the last ten years. Yet at the same time we have more knowledge, more doctors, hospitals, radio lectures on health and newspaper articles on how to keep well, etc., yet sickness is still on the increase. There must be a reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A number of men working on the Australian Railways complained that many of them were having sore hands. This matter was called to the attention of the officials of the railroad, and was thought to be due to the white metal handles on the shovels. The handles of these shovels were analyzed by a chemist in Brisbane, Australia, and showed 92.16 percent of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This analysis was sent to me for an opinion. I advised them that the trouble was due to the aluminum on the shovel handles, and recommended that their use be discontinued, and that the men were being poisoned by the aluminum coming in contact with their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Australian Railway Commission, after full investigation, recommended that all shovels of this type be discontinued. (This from an article in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail,</span><span class="font8"> August 8, 1935, Brisbane, Australia, under the heading of “Dangerous Tools”.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it not evident that if men with hard, cal-lused hands should be so affected as to make their hands sore, and probably poisoned in other ways, eating foods cooked in aluminum, which may contain quite a percentage of poisonous aluminum salts, would very quickly affect the delicate mucous membrane of the stomach, resulting in ulcers or other serious conditions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I might say that the above affected about 30,000 miles of railway.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Testimony of Informed Doctors</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Leo Spira, M.D., of Vienna, Austria, has written a booklet entitled “The Clinical Aspect of Chronic Poisoning by Aluminum and its Alloys”, published by John Bale, Sons &amp;&nbsp;Danielson, Ltd., London, England, giving the results of his observations over a period of ten years, showing many cases of chronic poisoning due to the use of aluminum cooking utensils. He has actually proved this by the success of the treatment based on his findings, in cases in which all other methods of treatment failed. Aluminum utensils were eliminated and quick recovery in most cases resulted. Return to the use of aluminum resulted in a relapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to German literature, diseases are making their appearance which have hitherto been unknown on the Continent. Gonnermann attributes this to the increased use of aluminum cooking utensils. Von Halla records 25 cases of constipation and skin diseases which did not yield to the orthodox treatment, but were cured by the removal of all aluminum cooking utensils. Cancer has increased in Austria in proportion to the increased use of aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. R. M. Le Hunte Cooper, M.D., B.S., etc., of London, England, has written a booklet of 32 pages entitled “The Danger of Food Contamination by Aluminum”, published by John Bale, Sons &amp;&nbsp;Danielson, Ltd., of London, England, in which he states he has so many cases of aluminum poisoning that he hardly knows which to discuss. Many are given in his booklet, showing where all orthodox treatment has failed, but when all aluminum utensils were removed, most of the patients quickly recovered. He refers to headache, pyorrhea, sore mouth, sore throat, rheumatism, neuritis, bowel conditions, indigestion, ulcers, skin affections, etc., all of which have been greatly relieved by eliminating the use of aluminum wares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“. . . Alum baking powders, which are used very extensively in the U.S.A., are forbidden in England, France, Germany, and many other countries . . .”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Hemorrhage of the Brain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">A hemorrhage of the brain is almost always caused by a poison. Strychnine poisoning invariably produces hemorrhage of the brain. Research has shown that the brain absorbs more aluminum than any other organ under certain conditions, and if death does not result, then the patient will probably become insane where large quantities of aluminum have been absorbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The information here given justifies us in never allowing any aluminum under any circumstances to enter our bodies from artificial sources. Why, even the suspicion that it might be poisonous ought alone to be sufficient. We cannot have too much evidence on the effects of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people have the impression that poisons should have a bitter or very unpleasant taste. This is true in some cases, such as strychnine, but with aluminum compounds there is little or no taste. That is one reason why some believe aluminum is not poisonous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In our daily papers it is very common to see some doctor writing on health topics and recommending the use of aluminum cooking utensils. Letters written to these same papers, explaining the poisonous properties of aluminum, are in nearly every case refused publication. Some of our so-called “scientific” magazines have published considerable on the aluminum question, trying to show that this metal is safe for cooking utensils. Of course, it must be remembered that the daily press and magazines carry large ads on aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of the so-called demonstrating cooking schools seem to be for the purpose of advertising the use of aluminum ware, as such utensils are almost invariably used exclusively. Whenever the question of the poisonous character of aluminum ware is raised, the one in charge usually becomes very austere, and indignantly denounces any such claims. This is usually followed by citing in parrot-like fashion the approval of the metal by a well-known professional association whose journal has carried numerous full-page ads that advocate the use of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From our investigation, we recommend iron, steel and stainless steel utensils; also agate, enamel and earthen ware. You will notice that foods have a different taste when they are not cooked in aluminum. We are in no way interested in any kind of cooking utensils, as to their manufacture or sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Remember, the continued use of aluminum wares will finally produce results which will be similar to leaving the foods standing in them for some time. It is the small quantities, as the Dispensatory points out, which are absorbed from the foods, which may produce indigestion, nervousness, constipation, cancer, etc.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Bacteria Thrive in Aluminum Vessels</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Did you ever find maggots in your aluminum pans ? Do you know that such pans may be full of the most deadly bacteria known to science?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost daily you read in the press of hundreds’ being poisoned by eating food cooked in aluminum. Do you know how such poisonings occur? If you do not, this will tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aluminum is a soft metal and is easily corroded and pitted under certain conditions. For example, when sauerkraut or vegetables are cooked in aluminum and allowed to stand for some time, the utensil often becomes badly pitted. It. has frequently happened that sauerkraut has eaten holes completely through the aluminum kettles in which it was prepared. Vegetables that are cooked with soda and salt will produce similar results. Corned beef corrodes most aluminum utensils. Rolled, pressed or cast aluminum all corrode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Various kinds of food that may lodge in such cavities cannot be thoroughly washed out. The food particles then decay or become rotten. If flies lay eggs in such spots, maggots will result, of course small in size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bacteria of many kinds, which may cause various diseases, are found in such recesses. Aluminum cooking utensils are often used to hold potatoes, beets, and other vegetables that come from the ground, bringing with them all kinds of bacteria. After a mere rinsing these utensils are used to hold milk, cream, chicken salads, etc., with the result that a heavy bacterial growth may soon result, which may cause serious illness. In fact, death has resulted in a number of cases, as will be shown later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bacteria are only about 1/25000 inch in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many bacteria double in number every half hour. Now, suppose that there are only a thousand bacteria in one of the cavities; double 1,000 ten successive times, and you will have some idea of the increase of bacteria possible in the space of five hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bacteria grow rapidly, and some of them die. Their dead bodies, together with the decomposed food they feed on, form other compounds known as toxins and ptomaines, which are among the most deadly poisons known to science.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Minutely Scrutinize Your Cockroach Castles</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Take a look at your aluminum ware through a small magnifying glass and you will see craters. It is impossible to wash or scour out all the various foods which lodge in these cavities. Many of these decaying cesspools hold food for the bacteria. Cockroaches would find food in these utensils, and they also carry disease germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Yes,” you say, “there are many such spots in my kettles, but boiling water will destroy all of these germs.” You are wrong. It will require more than boiling temperature to destroy the spores. When the food runs out and the temperature is too low, many forms of bacteria, especially the poisonous kinds or those that produce disease, change their form to what are known as spores. They lie dormant for years, or until conditions are favorable for their growth, or we may say that they “hibernate”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In various works on bacteriology, lengthy discussions on different forms of bacteria together with their mode of growth and their effect as to the cause of disease, etc., are given in detail, and it might be well for the reader to examine some of these works if he desires further information. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Principles of Bacteriology,</span><span class="font8"> by A. C. Abbott, M.D., professor of bacteriology at the University of Pennsylvania, states that the food supply for the majority of bacteria is dead vegetable and animal matter. In his book, Dr. Abbott states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. . . Under natural conditions it frequently occurs that the development of one species or group of species of bacteria is directly dependent upon the functional activities of another totally distinct species, the growth of one group resulting in conditions that are of vital importance to the existence of the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Abbott also states that spores of certain bacteria are not destroyed after exposure of from five to six hours to the temperature of boiling water. He further says that nearly all bacteria can be destroyed by subjecting them to a boiling temperature for fifteen minutes, then allowing them to stand at room temperature for twenty-four hours, then repeating this process for two more days. By this method spores develop into growing bacteria and are then destroyed by boiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cavities in aluminum ware must necessarily contain both animal and vegetable matter which will decompose or decay and furnish food for various kinds of bacteria. Bacteriological tests have shown this to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not assumed that every cooking utensil is infested with poisonous bacteria. Many of them may be harmless gas-producing bacteria, and this only in cases where there is pitting of the wares. However, wares that are free from pits now may be badly pitted in a few weeks, and so find homes for bacteria.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Frequent Cases of Food Poisoning</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known that many cases of food poisoning can be traced to various kinds of food prepared in aluminum. Some of them appear in the daily press, if they escape the censor. Let us take a few cases of food poisoning as reported by the United States Public Health Service, Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three men from the Navy poisoned by eating fried oysters. One dies. Investigation showed bacteria of extremely toxic nature. The oysters may have been kept in aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nine officers of the Navy poisoned by chicken salad. Samples of the salad showed large numbers of poisonous bacteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fourteen poisoned in the Navy from boiled smoked tongue. Tests showed large number of poisonous bacteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cheese poisoning. United States Ship Reuben James. Forty poisoned. No poisonous germs in the cheese, of course. Bacteria may have been in some of the other foods, as it is claimed the Army and Navy use aluminum utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fifty-eight poisoned by corned beef. None of the beef left for examination. Could have found plenty of bugs in aluminum kettles. All of these cases are in the Navy. We 'wonder how many there are that are not reported. Only wholesale cases reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The U. S. Public Health Service asks the question, “What would happen in case of war?” as the U. S. S. Reuben James was put out of action by the poisoning of the crew. In time of war, foods may stand in the cooking utensils for hours. Our battleships would be easy prey in case of a general food poisoning, for sick men could not navigate them, nor could they fire the guns. They would just be heading for the last round-up. Suppose an aviator with a lot of passengers aboard were suddenly taken sick from such poisoning. The same could be said of engineers. Many accidents happen, the causes of which are never explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In some cases of food poisoning people quickly become unconscious, death soon following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Others become dizzy, suffer from stomach trouble, intestinal affections, headache, great weakness, and partial paralysis, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the last war, a number of chemists who were in the chemical division told me that about half of the men were sick all the time with stomach trouble. Everything was cooked and kept in aluminum. I have been told that the government is throwing all aluminum utensils out of the Navy. Let us hope that this is true. The same should be done for the Army.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Don’t Blame the Water Only</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Water companies tell me that people sometimes complain that all in the family are sick with stomach trouble, etc., and it must be the water. Those who complain could probably find the cause in their aluminum utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Others blame the milk, the butcher, and the baker; and should sickness be due to their products, we should probably find that the foods had been placed in aluminum vessels. The farmer certainly gets plenty of inspection, but nothing is said about his placing food products in badly infected vessels made of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “Great Plague of London”, the “Black Death”, the bubonic plague, Asiatic cholera, etc., have killed millions throughout the world. But when the infected places were cleaned up and sanitary conditions were improved, the diseases nearly disappeared. The same can be said for the Panama Canal. All of these disease conditions were caused by various forms of bacteria. Bedbugs are carriers of the smallpox germ. Clean out the bedbugs, keep clean, and smallpox will disappear. And that goes for most other diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some doctors think infantile paralysis may start from a throat condition; others, that it starts in the intestinal tract. How could you expect a child to keep well if fed daily from aluminum pans that may be full of various kinds of disease germs and poisonous ptomaines?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Wholesale Poisonings</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">But let us turn to some further cases of wholesale poisoning:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a large general hospital, 325 employees were made ill..No report on the patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A large university hospital reported 15 doctors, 10 dietitians and 125 nurses poisoned by chicken salad kept in aluminum for a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New Jersey hospital, 50 guests poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New York state hospital, 65 poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New York state hospital, 60 poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New York city, 900 poisoned at a banquet. Ohio Y.W.C.A., 70 young women poisoned. Oklahoma State Home, 90 girls poisoned. Oregon College, 75 poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pennsylvania church supper, 200 poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">South Dakota Home, 250 poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are only a few of the many cases we could report. Thousands of individual cases could he given, with many deaths. In nearly all cases, aluminum utensils were used and foods were allowed to stand in them for some hours, which gave the bacteria a chance to develop, and in some cases to form poisonous ptomaines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some people may say, “Why does the government allow such utensils to be sold?” None of the government departments or the public health departments know that this condition exists. Doctors do not know about this danger, as several have been poisoned. Some have died soon after eating food from aluminum utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is a case that just occurred here in Scranton. Creamed chicken was served. A portion was then put in an aluminum pan in the refrigerator. The next day it was found that the chicken was bubbling up with gas. As it seemed to be fermenting, it was thrown out. This was due to the cavities in the aluminum pan being full of bacteria. Creamed chicken makes a good culture, or food, for bacteria. As bacteria have little mode of motion, the gas they form moves up through the food, carrying the bacteria along. The result is that all the food is soon contaminated with the bacteria, and so quickly becomes poisonous.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Doctors Urged to Help</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Hospitals are kept scrupulously clean. The utmost care is taken in the operating rooms to have everything thoroughly sterilized. Yet patients, though dangerously ill, many suffering from internal complications with infection, are given food that may contain large quantities of poisonous bacteria if prepared in aluminum wares that are pitted. The cases of doctors, nurses, etc., being poisoned by the hundreds need no further proof. They certainly would not knowingly cook spoiled or decayed food. We believe they use much care to be sure that food products are of the best quality. We think the same can be said for our Navy and War Departments, as well as for all other organizations. Yet in most of the poisoning cases, investigation has shown poisonous bacteria to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I call upon the doctors of all schools to help inform the public of this grave danger, so as to protect the sick in our hospitals and homes. The first duty of every statesman should be the health of the nation, and I trust all will try to bring this question to the attention of all public officials. Laws should be passed prohibiting the manufacture of aluminum ware for use in preparing any kind of food products and medical preparations. Sick people are a liability to the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A doctor wrote me that he had a cancer on his face. He stopped using aluminum, and in a few months the cancer nearly disappeared. Then he ate squash, cooked in aluminum. In 48 hours it was like a raging volcano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two well-known cancer surgeons died last year from cancer. They said they used aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A man in New York city stated that his mother died from aluminum poisoning, together with complications of cancer, according to the physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cancer patients should avoid all kinds of aluminum wares, also all food products that may be prepared in aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A doctor here in Scranton told me he had aluminum poisoning. He died three weeks later. Many more could be given.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Avoid Restaurants Using Aluminum</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">I would caution against eating in hotels and restaurants where aluminum utensils are used. Such establishments should put on their menus, “Nothing prepared in aluminum,” when that is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Gazette</span><span class="font8"> states that the new Thompson restaurant is equipped with stainless steel, which contains no copper, zinc, tin, or aluminum to react with food acids or taint foods with a metallic flavor. Stainless steel is not plated, and is unrusting and untarnishing, and is considered the very best.” When you are in Pittsburgh, there is one place that should be free from poisonous food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have personally given several pieces of stainless steel a most severe test over a period of time and can find no pitting in these utensils and have found them satisfactory in my home. I also use agate, enamel and earthen wares, and know that iron utensils are entirely safe. Monel metal is widely used for utensils and is very satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am interested only in the health of the public, and I believe the above suggestions will be of benefit to all to avoid heading for the last round-up. Will .you do your part?

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Aluminum Poison and “Egypt” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By I. D. Witter (Canada)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N THE course of making an examination of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font8"> in reference to Egypt, “The Black Land,” the astonishing coincidence of diseases similar to those caused by aluminum poisoning referred to in No. 342 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> and the conditions of the drinking water in the affected area at and near the outlet or mouth of the Nile was noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the ninth edition of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</span><span class="font8"> Vol. VII, page 700, “Diseases of Egypt”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the fineness of the climate, the stranger who visits Egypt is struck by the signs which he sees everywhere of the prevalence of many serious diseases, and in the first half of this century he might have witnessed the effects of a great epidemic of the plague or the cholera. . . . Ophthalmia followed by blindness . . . dysentery is very often fatal. . . . The plague has been the greatest scourge of Egypt . . . there have been no severe epidemics of plague elsewhere in the same period . . . The plague starts at Alexandria [at the mouth of the river] quickly travelling as far up the river as Cairo . . . (Evidently the river above Cairo does not become as greatly polluted.) . . . Dysentery is common, causing a very large mortality . . . 200,000 perished from cholera in Egypt during the plague in 1848 . . . Among the diseases most dreaded by European residents is liver complaint . . . Hemorrhoids and herniae are among the commonest maladies . . . Skin diseases have been at all times prevalent in Egypt . . . Madness is common, generally in the form of idiocy . . , idiots are regarded with much respect as saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A paragraph in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 342, page 37:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such a condition could cause paralysis, insanity, cancer, rheumatism, neuritis, indigestion, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, some forms of skin disease, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rheumatism also is common in Egypt. Cholera is an abdominal and intestinal poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now for the cause??? The waters of the Nile are turbid at all times except a short period in midsummer. On page 705 of same volume (VII, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ency. Brit.):</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Turbid appearance due to large quantities of earthy matter which are annually deposited . . . Analysis of deposit: Water 11, Carbon .09, Oxide of iron .06, Silica .04, Carbonate of magnesia .04, Carbonate of lime .18, </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alumen</span><span class="font6"> .48. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alum</span><span class="font6"> is from Alumen (see Vol. I, page 644, sixth paragraph, subject “Aluminum”). The water is extremely sweet, particularly in its turbid state. [Quoting from page 706:] A careful filtration destroys its peculiar flavor, and the best method is to allow it to settle in the porous jars manufactured in the country. [These jars are probably made out of the same earthy substance.] It is very wholesome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that this water is sweet seems to show that it must reek with alum. The fact that it is recommended as being wholesome is another proof that there is something wrong with it. The fact that these diseases coincide with those resulting from aluminum poisoning also proves that something is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cause is unknown ? ? ? What do you make of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Aluminum Not Fit for My Dog</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By H. P. Haley (Xew Hampshire)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">E HAVE a little dog and it is the last thing I would ever think of to even give her a drink of water from an aluminum container; we think too much of her. As for ourselves, you can no doubt guess the answer. No aluminum cooking dishes in our house!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am 6 feet 1 inch, weigh around 270, am 55 years old and healthy as a bear, but fully convinced that such would not be the case had I not become wise to the danger of aluminum both through articles in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> and in my own experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A few years ago, working in a railroad tower, I purchased an aluminum saucepan, and used same to get my suppers, boiling tea in it or making chowders, etc., from August until along in January, when I had a nice two weeks’ session from my job, with a doctor working over me the first week trying to get the machinery around my gall bladder to function, with everything at a standstill, and pain unmentionable, and the other week to get back on my feet at home where the Mrs. never would use aluminum, and then back to the job, continuing to use my aluminum dish and gradually getting back into the condition I was in before having the doctor; but, luckily, I got through on this job and discarded the pan, getting the home free from possibility of further poisoning, and came back on my feet in no time. Previous to this I had never given aluminum a thought, and went back for a second dose of it. But never again. We learn slowly, but surely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctor Clendening, Widely Advertised</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">octor Clendening, widely advertised, and widely uninformed, tremendously so, in one of his syndicated articles made this statement: </span><span class="font6">That aluminum is perfectly harmless is indicated by the fact that aluminum is more and more supplanting other metals in dental work as a substitute due to the present scarcity of gold. It hardly is possible that dentists would agree to put into the mouth a substance which they thought would cause cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When this was brought to the attention of Dr. C. T. Betts he showed that Doctor Clendening did not know the first thing about what he was talking about, by making the following observations :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aluminum has been practically discarded in all dental appliances and denture work. This is due to the fact that practically all those who wear either the swedged or cast aluminum plate bases soon find constant irritation of the mouth results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aluminum is poisonous, like other metals. We are all familiar with mercurial poisoning or that made by copper vessels called verdigris. The workers at the radium paint factory in New Jersey were affected with what is termed radium poisoning, 22 of whom have already died and the others are suffering, and no antidote is known. Arsenic is a rank poison; so is lead; in fact, any metal that is so soft it becomes a part of the food and finely divided so that it is digestible; poisoning results from its ingestion.</span></p>

Here is what he wrote to the warden of the Michigan state prison when they had a huge poisoning bee there lately. He also sent a similar letter to Dr. H. C. Wells, Franklin County Home, Columbus, Ohio, when they had a similar bee there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">June 10, 1937 Warden Joel Moore Michigan State Prison Jackson, Midi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Mr. Moore:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was up to visit your institution some time ago and had the unusual experience of going thru your department of kitchens. I observed the extensive kitchen equipment, especially the large round-bottomed kettles in which was boiling water ready to be filled with beans and other edibles. I noticed the millions of aluminum hydroxide specks moving around in the water and on the surface, due to the heat. I mentioned to my friend that it would not be long until there would be an extensive poisoning of the inmates of Jackson Prison as we find occurring in practically all large institutions where this cooking ware is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find that many foods are cooked in aluminum where salt and vinegar are used. You get an aluminum acetate if you use vinegar, and aluminum chloride if you use salt. Both of these are good for embalming fluids used by morticians. This is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">very vital and important fact which should be taken into consideration when persons are under the public’s care in an institution like yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can’t see how anybody, whether interested in Mellon or any organization making aluminum ware, can help seeing the above point. Surely if we are interested in keeping people healthy it is about time that we called a halt upon the sale of aluminum kitchenware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We hope something will be done to prevent these extensive group poisonings from mineral acid as formed by aluminum utensils in your institution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">My mother, who is 57 years of age, has for several years now been very sickly; in fact, she was getting so sick I thought she would not live long. She has been troubled with her stomach, having severe cases of vomiting after almost every meal in the morning, and sometimes it made her sick for the whole day, and so weak she was unable to work around the house or even cook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year I read in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> magazine about aluminum poisoning. I told my mother she should try a different pot to cook in, so she bought herself an enamel pot; and did she note the difference! She feels fine now, and able to work and cook and is not troubled with vomiting and weakness any more. From the very day she changed her pot to cook in she became well. She is very grateful and tells everyone she knows how she gained back her health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I myself am 23 years old and have for many years been troubled with severe head colds and hay fever. We quit using aluminum last August, and this year I got head colds less and now have had none for over four months. And here I am, in hay-fever time with goldenrod all around me, and ragweed with which you could make a haystack, and have not had an attack of hay fever yet. I sleep better than ever before, and can do a good day’s work every day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Three Eminent Physicians</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rpHREE eminent physicians have expressed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font8">opinions on drugs that are well worth considering. These men stand among the highest in the profession. Captain Hughes Merns, Surgeon General’s Office, Washington, D.C., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No reputable physician nowadays gives medicine indiscriminately to every patient who applies. The modem doctor has lost his old-time faith in drugs, for the simple reason that they do not always do what is claimed for them. Frequently, we have found that they do more harm than good. A drug, for instance, may “cure” a pain in the head, but do permanent damage somewhere else. Hundreds of drugs have been dropped from American authorized lists, and it is generally believed that more will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Daniel H. Kress, M.D., wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Drugs never cure disease. They merely hush the voice of nature’s protest, and pull down the danger signals she erects along the pathway of transgression. Any poison taken into the system has to be reckoned with later on even though it palliates present symptoms. Pain may disappear, but the patient be left in a worse condition, though unconscious of it at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. William Osler, one of America’s most eminent physicians, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The patient who takes medicine must recover twice: once from the disease and once from the medicine. The only drugs that are worth an oyster-shucker’s oath are those that smell good, taste good and are harmless.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">By Trail and Stream and Garden Path </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Grace A. Estep (Pennsylvania)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font8">ANE walked slowly along the dusty road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was a perfect September afternoon. The sky was close and blue and smiling. The wayside was gay with brilliant autumn blooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A black and yellow and white caterpillar hurried along the road hunting for a place to make her bed. An orange and brown butterfly danced among the flowers, while a dark-blue one settled on a goldenrod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pretty wild grasses waved their graceful heads and sowed their tiny seeds. Red apples shone on laden trees; and red seedpods dangled from vines and bushes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A few soft bird-songs broke the lazy stillness. Jane stopped to listen. All at once a sound behind her caused her to turn, just in time to see a boy raising a rifle to his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“John! Stop that!” she screamed, but too late. A shot rang out, and the very song to which she had been listening was broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“John! Why did you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The boy looked up, a little surprised. “I wanted to see if I could hit it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All right. You did hit it. Now what? There it lies, a lifeless bunch of feathers and flesh and bone, its little throat still swelled with the last song it will ever sing—the very song I was listening to—the song it will never finish. Can you give it back its song? Can you make its heart beat again?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John stared strangely at the tiny bird at his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“John, do you know who gave us our birds? The great Creator, of course. And why did He give them to us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The boy shook his head, and, hanging it lower, said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“This little fellow that you have just killed spent his life in serving you and me. Harmful insects and weed seeds were the main part of his diet. Oh, yes, he took an occasional cherry, pecked at a few apples—but the damage he did is so small it can’t even be counted at all when compared to the great good he did. God has arranged things so wonderfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Do you know, John, that if it weren’t for the birds we could not live? The harmful insects would have no enemies to destroy them. They would eat up all our crops, our trees, our flowers. Before long we should be living in a desolate, dry earth with no food, and shortly we’d all die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John seemed puzzled. He dug his toe into the dust, and thought it over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Even if birds had no such value, we love their song; we enjoy their beautiful colors and the graceful way they fly; we find their nests and feeding habits interesting; we marvel at the long flights they make over land and sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John looked up suddenly. “The police in our town shoot the birds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“More shame to them. I know they shoot the starlings because they are noisy. Some meddlesome old women and stupid old men who never do much of anything—especially anything good •—spend their time thinking up things to fuss hbout. One of their pet complaints is that the birds in the trees make too much noise. Then the gallant police trot out and shoot them. But the starlings are very helpful birds and should be cared for and protected.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But crows are no good, are they?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Oh, yes, Johnny. The farmers make raids on the crows, determined to lull all they can; but they’ll be surprised to find some day, when it’s too late that the crows helped their crops, including corn, a lot more than they damaged them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John dropped his gun and looked again at the little dead bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“People are pretty silly, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Indeed they are, John.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Is it wrong to kill anything?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Some things that are harmful or are needed for food have to be killed. But they should be killed in a way that will not make them suffer. It is wrong to be cruel to anything.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“God doesn’t like cruel people—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“No, He certainly doesn’t.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mormon Doctrine and Covenants</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font8">J. McFadden, Utah pioneer, one of Jeho-• vah’s witnesses, had occasion to examine the Mormon “Doctrine and Covenants”, and noticed the following inconsistencies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Section 107, verse 54, says God blessed Adam and called him Michael; section 128, verse 21, speaks of Michael or Adam; section 78, verse 16, speaks of Michael your prince, establishing his feet, setting him upon high and giving unto him the keys of salvation, under the counsel and direction of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life; section 88, verse 113, tells that the Devil shall gather together his armies, even the hosts of hell, and shall come up to battle against Michael and his armies; section 88, verse 115, says that Michael shall fight their battles and shall overcome him who seeketh the throne of Him who sitteth upon the throne, even the Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing passages of “Doctrine and Covenants” teach that Michael is Adam and that this said Michael or Adam is going to fight Christ’s battles in the last days. There is no place in the Bible where Adam is called Michael. There is no place where it is shown that Adam, after he turned away from God and was driven out of Eden, ever repented of his sin or returned to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible teaches plainly that the dead do not know anything, and that a day is coming when they will be awakened. It nowhere teaches as does “Doctrine and Covenants” that Adam is now alive. This work states in one place that Adam will not appear as a man, and in another that he will appear as a man. Believe whichever you choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Section 93: 29 states that man was in the beginning with God. But the Bible, Genesis 2: 5, says that there was not a man upon the earth ■ and Genesis 2: 7, that God made man. If so, how was he in the beginning with God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Section 134:1 states that all governments were instituted by God for the benefit of man; and 134:5, that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside. Then how about Daniel 2:44, that God will set up a kingdom that shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and stand for ever in their room and stead?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other errors are in section 19:18, that God trembles because of pain; 20: 28, that Father, Son and “Holy Ghost” are one God; 29: 22, 23, that heaven and earth shall pass away after the thousand-year reign; 29:47, that Satan cannot tempt little children; 38:1, that Christ is the great I AM; 93: 33, that man is a spirit; 107:43, that Seth was a perfect man; and 128:15, that we cannot be made perfect without our dead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N THE Roman Catholic church organization images and paintings are used. Such is a religious practice, and all religion emanates from the Devil, as Jesus stated. (Matthew 15:1-9; John 8:44) Concerning images </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font8"> (Vol. XII) says: “Religion: In every form of religion is implied the conviction that the mysterious, supernatural Being (or beings) has control over the lives and destinies of men. . . . Thus, in its strictest sense, religion on its subjective side is the disposition to acknowledge our dependence on God, and on the objective side it is the voluntary acknowledgment of that dependence through acts of homage. . . . The Christian religion has allowed the use of statues and paintings to represent the incarnate Son of God, the saints, and angels, and these images are a legitimate aid to devotion, since the honour that is given them is but relative, being directed through them to the beings they represent. It is like the relative honour given to the flag of the nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such practice is in direct violation of God’s law, and therefore shows that the same originated with the Devil to deceive the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah gives the unchangeable command to all who will please Him, to wit: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.”— Exodus 20:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God promulgated this law to safeguard his people from Devil worship. The purpose of the Devil is to turn mankind’away from God, and anything that has </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> tendency to divert the mind from Jehovah and Christ Jesus is clearly the Devil’s scheme. The Catholic doctrine concerning images used in worship is wholly unsupported by the Scriptures. On the contrary, every text relating to images shows that such are an abomination in the sight of God. (Exodus 32: 7-11; Habakkuk 2:18) “Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.” —Jeremiah 10:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why should anyone pray to or before an image of Christ Jesus, who is alive and to whom and through whom prayer is properly addressed to Jehovah? Jesus gave a model prayer to His followers, as set forth in Matthew 6:9-15. It is the privilege of each Christian without the aid of priests or any other person or of any image, to address his prayer to Jehovah God in the name of Christ Jesus. “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” (John 14:13) “Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.”—John 15:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font8"> above cited likens such use of images to giving honor to the flag of a nation. This shows that flag saluting is a religious ceremony, because such saluting attributes salvation to what the flag represents. Salvation can come only through Jehovah God by Christ Jesus. (Acts 4:12) An effort is now being made, at the instance of the Catholic Hierarchy, to compel school children, contrary to the Bible, to salute the flag; and the purpose is to compel them to engage in a form of religion, which is in direct violation of God’s law. This of itself shows that it is a subtle scheme of the wily Devil to turn creatures away from Jehovah and to thereby carry out the Devil’s challenge, boastfully made to God, that he could turn them away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostles of Jesus never used images, because such are a violation of God’s law. Says McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia,</span><span class="font8"> Volume IV: “Images were unknown in the worship of the primitive Christians.” The use of images in worship originated with Satan, and has ever since been taught by tradition of men, and is therefore an abomination in the sight of God. The true followers of Christ Jesus do not require some inanimate object to aid them in con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Unsavory Odors from Chicago</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font8">HICAGO newspapers are always ready to speak evil of Jehovah’s witnesses. On September 28 and 29, 1936, they did nobly at it. Headlines as follows greeted the public: “Refuses to Salute Flag; Goes to Jail.” “Flag Defier Given Bail; Jehovah’s witness Freed on Bond in Flag Case.” “Cultist Snubs Flag in Court; Gets Six Months.” They were unanimous in this, from the Hearst cesspools of journalism to that whited sepulchre of propaganda called the Chicago </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The occasion of this outburst was the case of Mary Schlorachetka. Mary is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and while peacefully presenting the truth to the people was arrested and charged with “passing out Communist literature and causing a breach of the peace by knocking at doors of private dwellings”. She was brought before Judge Joseph B. Hermes, who immediately saw and grasped an opportunity to get his name and his picture in the papers. So, in the presence of photographers and reporters this judicial misfit thundered, “I command you to salute that flag.” Mary Schlorachetka calmly declined to do so, as she had right. Thereupon it was ordered, adjudged and decreed by this priest of patriotism that the superintendent of the House of Correction</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“take the body of the defendant and confine her at labor until the whole of said fine and costs ($210.00) shall have been worked out by the defendant at the rate of $2.00 per day”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But Judge Hermes went too fast and too far. He had no authority to demand a salute. He was without right to impose a fine or prison sentence in the case. He violated the law, committed judicial malfeasance, and was guilty of disorderly conduct. And thereupon the City of Chicago became embarrassed, for Mary Schlo-rachetka’s case was promptly appealed to the Appellate Court of Illinois. The corporation counsel of the city found themselves unable to defend the conduct of this disorderly beak and promptly filed a motion to “enter a confession of error” on the part of the city. And, Annabolona, when the high-priced corporation counsel of a large city are unable to find law to justify the acts of a high city official you can make up your mind that the effluvia is very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What did the news purveyors (?) of Chicago then do ? Did they also “confess error” ? Did they admit they had given one of Jehovah’s witnesses a raw deal ? They had painted a Christian, lawabiding woman of the city as criminal, but when it came to correcting the error they were as silent as the Statue of Liberty. The code of ethics of Chicago newspapers does not permit them to correct their misrepresentations. And, my dearly beloved Sassafras, neither does that bear the aroma of hyacinth or heliotrope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will some kind-hearted friend send the man in Luna a gas mask?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even in Chicago there are some lawyers who have manhood and courage sufficient to protest over the wrongful acts of disorderly magistrates. Landon L. Chapman, attorney, member of the Chicago Cohimittee of the Civil Liberties Union, disapproved of the exhalations from Judge Hermes’ court (so called) and filed a complaint with the Judiciary Committee, Committee of Inquiry, and Committee for the Defense of Prisoners, of the Chicago Bar Association. This complaint, with its sixteen pages of allegations and exhibits, described Judge Hermes as a blemish to the judicial system; stated that he was unfit to hold public office, and that his misconduct brought discredit to the bench and bar of Chicago. Hearings have been held, and the matter is still pending before the committees.' A decision and report on these hearings based on justice and righteousness will be a real aid to honest people in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, the chances are that such a report will not receive extensive publicity. When it comes to telling the people something that is likely to be of benefit to them and that will expose the Devil’s tracks, there is loud silence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">But what is puzzling me most of all is just how the birds and animals (all, you notice) are to get a blessing. If the hawk that steals my chickens is going to get blessed, are my chickens going to be in luck? And will the old tom-cat that keeps me awake at night get a blessing, too? And if this sort of thing goes on, just where is it going to stop? For tom-cats are not the only living things that disturb peaceful slumber, and perhaps next week the “reverend” will realize that he’s forgotten a blessing for all insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And is a horse a clergyman’s colaborer? Or is the animal an ass?</span></p>

It also denounced the scandal of the free supply of arms and ammunition of all kinds to the aggressor and the simultaneous refusal of the most elementary means of defense to the other state. Two of the stirring statements in the manifesto follow: “Germany’s rearmament is disturbing the peace of Europe, Japan continues her impudent predatory campaign in China, and Fascist Italy, having reduced her own people to a state of slavery, is taking the field on the pretext of abolishing slavery in Ethiopia, and trampling half a dozen solemnly concluded treaties under foot, threatens to begin a cynical war of conquest. If war breaks out, the Labor and Socialist International expresses the hope, on behalf of the workers of all countries, that the workers of Italy will succeed in taking advantage of the confusion caused by the war, to defeat the real enemies of the Italian people, who are not at Addis Ababa, but in Rome.” (Wonder if they meant Rome only or also meant to include Vatican City?

It is interesting to see the same spirit manifested today. The following from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Freeman’s Journal</span><span class="font8"> of Sydney, Australia, is an example. After admitting the truth as to what Armageddon will accomplish in the earth it makes haste to assert that nobody will ever know anything worth while about it, least of all Jehovah’s own witnesses in “the evil day” (parenthetical remarks are by the editor):</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Armageddon is the symbol of the final struggle of good and evil, when evil forces will combine against the influence of Christ. The issue will be the final triumph of good over evil. When this final phase of the age-long struggle between good and evil will oecur is not known. Christ himself said it is not given to man to know the day and the hour. The predictions of people like the Russellites [How the preachers do love to call names!] or Witnesses of Jehovah, and their absurd literalism in their interpretation of the most mystical of all books, Revelation [a charge perfectly absurd to anybody who has read </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light],</span><span class="font6"> cannot but be rejected by all sensible men.

That was three years ago, and she has not needed a doctor since; and that suggests why some doctors ‘think aluminum is all right to cook in’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Outwitting the Hierarchy in “The Speck &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Bert Shearmur, Tasmanian Pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ASMANIA is an island off the southeast coast of Australia. Australia is also an island, but so large that it is classed as a continent, and would about fill the Atlantic ocean between Ireland and New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In comparison with the mainland, Tasmania (26,215 square miles in area) is so small that it is facetiously called “The Speck”. Yet for all its minuteness the enemies of the truth are as strongly entrenched there as elsewhere, and this little island may yet see one of the bitterest struggles associated with Jehovah’s “strange work”. Whether by chance or design, certain laws have been passed that might appear to make the sound work impossible:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The owner or driver of a vehicle . . . upon any public street shall not ring any bell, blow any horn, or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">use any noisy instrument.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“No owner or occupant of any land or premises within the city of Hobart shall, upon such land or premises, within hearing of any person being upon any street, footway, or public place, or in any premises abutting or adjacent thereto, cause, permit, or suffer any sound or noise to be emitted from any wireless set, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">phonograph, </span><span class="font8">or player-piano, so as to cause annoyance or obstruction to any such person as aforesaid.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>Intolerable Misuse of Tolerance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">In Tasmania, like most British dominions, the question of compulsory flag-saluting and other forms of coercive regimentation has not become so acute as in other countries, not only because the British governing power has a genius for compromise, but also because the British throne, being nominally “Protestant”, claims to stand for tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This tolerance, however, as other countries have found to their cost, has been the back door to intolerance; and the Roman Hierarchy, knowing the British repugnance for violent forms of propaganda, has resorted to more subtle methods in its bid for world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is considered that the British Foreign Office is under Jesuit influence; and the British dominions, with their freedom from effete and cramping tradition, have become a happy hunting ground for this ‘leopard that never changes its spots”. Temporary success seems to have crowned their efforts, as the conditions in Tasmania indicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The coercion or deluding of non-Catholics appears to be complete. Else how could it be that in a country where Roman Catholics form only 15 percent of the population, the premier, most of the State cabinet, and most of the heads of government departments and essential services, are members of that religious organization? And in the ramifications of the State services the agents of the Hierarchy are to be found in all the key positions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it any wonder, then, that there is a network extending throughout the State that keeps its victims well instructed and under direct control? This is proved by the fact that the Catholics isolated in the bush have the same attitude and use exactly the same words as those in the towns. It is obvious that the Tasmanian state system is but an extension of a world-wide organization that is under the control of a central authority that insists that its orders be passed on and enforced. In the world there is no other organization so complete and ruthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So it is not surprising that when the witnesses in Tasmania got really busy with their sound equipment, their phonographs became known as “Little Protestants” and their sound car as the “Hierarchy’s Horror” because of the consternation caused in the enemy’s camp whenever their voice is heard.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Biblical Instruction in Schools</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">There was a time when Scriptural instruction was given in the Tasmanian schools. This was free from sectarian influence and consisted mainly of Bible readings; and while it did not directly teach the children anything of Jehovah’s purpose, it did good in that it made them acquainted with the text of the Bible and the Bible characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But subtle influence caused this Scriptural instruction to be eliminated and sectarian teaching substituted. This meant that the various clergymen gave religious instruction to such children as desired it or could not dodge it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy could now raise the cry that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font8"> children were not being properly instructed, and hence they must start their own schools. So whichever instruction the children received, it gave them a bad start before being launched out under a system that condones lying, duplicity and chicanery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With so much official opposition to the truth it might seem a hopeless task to get the Kingdom message into the schools. But by taking the schools in our stride we witnesses find the Lord blesses our efforts. The schoolteacher is witnessed to first, and invited to hear a lecture on the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even when this is given outside, the children inside can invariably hear. But when consent for a lecture is given w<sup>y</sup>e immediately suggest that it would be good for the children to hear such important Scriptural instruction. In this way well over a thousand children have heard Judge Rutherford’s lectures in their school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On one occasion while witnessing round a block we came on a Church of England school. Noticing its elevated position we asked permission to run the sound car into their grounds so as to broadcast over the surrounding district. This consent was given, and when we started our program we noticed that the school children were lined up near the sound car, following everything with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When later we called at the school to offer our thanks we found that a group of school teachers had also followed the program with interest and pleasure. A clergyman living on this same block was very much opposed to our work, and it was quite a while before he realized what had taken place within his own organization.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Like Jesus on the Sea of Galilee</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">We visited the wharf one day; but the harbor master, who is a Roman Catholic, flatly refused to let us use the sound car on the street. So we went across to a man who was selling fish from a boat, and explained the position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With that we took the sound equipment off the car and fixed it upon the boat. The music and lecture sounded perfect over the water, and over 300 men on the surrounding wharves listened attentively to the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Police and harbor officials came along and watched us with a puzzled look. But what could they do? There is nothing wrong with Bible lectures, is there? And a sheet of water is not a street, is it ? And a fisherman can do as he likes with his own boat, can’t he?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>Hearing Ears Among the Prisoners</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">One Saturday afternoon we visited the jail. We drove the sound car in and had to pass three sets of gates, each of which was carefully locked before we were allowed to pass the next. We drove up in front of the men’s yards with the cells of the more desperate men in a gallery at the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Turning the horn towards the men, and with guards around us, we commenced our program. The men became silent, and many clustered along the bars, all listening attentively and many reverently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When we had finished, the head warder called me over to the bars; and one of the prisoners stepped forward and said, “On behalf of the men here, I wish to thank you for what you have done for us this afternoon. You could have spent your time in some other way, and it was good of you to come here. We appreciate what you have done, and we want you to come again. And whatever else you forget, don’t forget that last statement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When it is remembered that the British prison population is 87 percent Roman Catholic and that the governor of this particular jail is a Roman Catholic, to get in and out in such an easy and effective way is a tribute to the power of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The effective use of the sound equipment often requires ingenuity and perseverance. But the Lord has given His people a mouth that none of His adversaries can gainsay or resist. The Hierarchy is outwitted every time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Crowds that Heard the Bishop</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Trinity Church Herald,</span><span class="font8"> East Melbourne, Australia, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bishop of Goulburn (Dr. Burgmann) is probably the foremost scholar, the most fearless thinker and one of the most incisive speakers on the Bench of Bishops in Australia. He is so much sought after as a speaker on modern problems that the city of Adelaide asked him to give the Bevan lectures in the principal Congregational Church of that city. He delivered the same four lectures in St. Peter’s Church, Melbourne. The notice of the lectures was probably read in every parish church in the metropolis. An opportunity was afforded Church people such as will perhaps never occur again. And what was the net result ? About 150 people attended out of a Church of England population of 340,000. Of these 150, less than 20 were men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question: If less than one-twentieth of one percent come out to hear the foremost thinker and speaker in the church, how long after the earth is robed in the moral achievements of Episcopalians will it be before some ring-tailed ornithorhynchus will be occupying a pulpit in every cathedral in Australia?</span></p>

Since that time 4,500,000 potential workers have come into the labor market, for whom there have never been any jobs. As a consequence, even if the boom levels of 1929 could be reached, there would still be 6,500,000 Americans who wish to work and will be unable to find anything to do. Additionally, the matter is complicated by the fact that, as compared with 1929, the same volume of work can now be turned out with 12 percent fewer workers and 20 percent less wages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">An extract from a recent letter, regarding a priest in a midwestern city, makes the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of Jehovah’s witnesses last Sunday called at the home of a Polish man here in ------ [Illinois]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">who told her he was making guns for his priest, “Father”------, of------■ church here in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He exhibited one of the guns, a single-barreled rifle. He said this priest has his basement stocked. The Polish man stated, “He all’a time want more guns. Now what he want with so many guns? If he Christian, he no need guns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every year the list of Holy Name societies gets longer and the widely touted masses and breakfasts get more publicity. Besides the previous ones, the year 1937 had glories of this nature for the American Railway Express Catholic employees and the Port of New York Authority Catholic employees. The idea is to impress the public with the thought that the Catholics are running everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">St. Andrews Roman Catholic church, Duane street and Cardinal place, New York city, is the church around which all the new municipal administration buildings were built, and which thus is made to seem a part of New York city’s government. To aid this dastardly attack upon democracy the ninth annual “red mass” was celebrated October 13, 1936, under the auspices of the Guild of Catholic Lawyers, with a former mayor of New York as its president This “red mass”, so called because the priests on this occasion dress in red, is supposed to mark the beginning of a new judicial year. Red is generally considered the color of anarchy.</span></p>

France contributed $736,000, and Britain $343,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will Hays, back from conferences with the pope and Mussolini regarding American films, expressed his amazement of the pope’s wide knowledge of the American film industry. Make no mistake, the pope’s system of gathering detailed information about anything and everything that he desires to control is unequaled by any other government on earth. What other government has spies in every office, and in perhaps a majority of homes, reporting every move?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>Control of Radio</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">At a dinner in New York, November 9, in observance of the tenth anniversary of the National Broadcasting Company, President Roosevelt wrote the guests:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Radio broadcasting is an essential service to the American home in the moulding of public opinion. It must be maintained for the American people, free of bias, or prejudice, or sinister control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">President Roosevelt well knows that the National Broadcasting Company will not permit Jehovah’s witnesses to broadcast their allimportant message over its network, even for hire, but they can and do permit the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to broadcast regularly, without money and without price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He also knows that millions of American people desire to hear Judge Rutherford’s lectures, and have repeatedly petitioned Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to that effect, but persons not “free of bias”, and not free from “prejudice”, and not free from the “sinister control” of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have conspired and do conspire to ignore such petitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And the president of the United States has, in effect, advised that the reasonable and proper desires of these American people (the total of signatures running somewhere around 7,000,000) be ignored, and “bias”, and “prejudice” and “sinister control” from Rome continue in the future as in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">President Roosevelt well knows of the successful effort of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to deprive Judge Rutherford and his friends of the use of radio station WIP at Philadelphia, and he well knows of the suits, amounting to $200,000, brought by Judge Rutherford and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, for depriving them of these rights, but his own “bias”, and “prejudice” and “sinister control” prevent him from telling the plain truth as a president (one would think) ought surely to do, on such an important subject.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>Freedom of Opinion O.K.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">The racketeers in the Roman Catholic organization are strong for freedom of “opinion”. You can think as you like and what you like, provided—. Also, they believe in freedom of the radio—for themselves and their tools. It would move a crocodile to tears, but fool nobody, to see and hear and read their struggles and arguments for liberty—under their benign supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yes, the Hierarchy, for it is of them, dear reader, that this is written, are benignant— as a viper. They are so solicitous for your welfare—hereafter. They would save your soul from “future pains”, though, unfortunately, they find it necessary to inflict themselves and their oppressive scheme on others to save you from that “purgatory” which they have themselves, with Satan’s aid, invented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what about Archbishop John T. McNicho-las? Oh, he was the proponent of freedom a short time ago when he made it a point to emphasize the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, for and with whom he works, should have freedom to get its hands into the public treasury for its “schools”, for it is “unjust for the state to tax Catholics for the support of 'unreligious’ or public schools”. So-o-o? It is doubtless considered unjust also to tax parents whose children have grown up, and to tax those who have no children, of whom there are many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the archbishop is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of his hearers. He should admit that many wise Catholic parents haven’t the least inclination to send their children to parochial schools. (If a law is ever enacted to give State support to Catholic schools, then the same law should stipulate that Catholic children shall be prohibited from attending any public school.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Freedom for the Catholic Hierarchy crowd demands that the subject of the Hierarchy shall be “educated” in schools of its own conception. Otherwise the freedom of the Hierarchy might be somewhat restricted when it comes to keeping its subjects in line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let the Hierarchy build all the schools it wants, and pay for them as other sects and denominations do. And let all the Catholics who so desire send their children to such schools to have their intellects educated as the Chinese girls used to have their feet educated in the past. But let not the liberty-loving Catholics be coerced by underhanded methods to send their children to schools which are not, and never will be, the. equal of the American public school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let no one be fooled by the archbishop’s panegyric of freedom. His advocacy of freedom is properly suspect. He had an ax to grind; and don’t think he did not. He mentions, among other things, freedom of the radio. The hypocrite! The kind of freedom of radio he believes in is exemplified in the course he pursued in seeing that Judge Rutherford was prevented from speaking over a local radio station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In no field is hypocrisy in one’s attitude toward freedom of speech more evident than in radio. No one is obliged to listen to a speaker he does not like to hear. Hence, those who are subject to the archbishop’s control could very easily be instructed to refrain from listening to Judge Rutherford. It is not exactly the American idea of freedom, but if these folks want to be that way, that is their business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, that was not the archbishop’s only objective. He wanted to be sure that no other radio listener should hear Judge Rutherford, including all who wanted to hear him. Behold the Hierarchy’s love for free speech, gentle reader, and weep softly at the hardness of your own heart in your lack of appreciation of their lofty principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you have difficulty in stirring up your dormant appreciation you might call to mind the many evidences history affords of the Hierarchy’s love of freedom of opinion. The men tortured on the rack, the women whose breasts were torn off, the virgins who were violated by inquisitors, the children who were burnt at the stake, the youths who were put to death by slow torture—all these had entire “freedom of opinion”. Let no one tell you anything different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All they had to do to escape some of the tortures and be killed more quickly was to profess what they did not believe, and to confess “crimes” they had not committed. This is what the Hierarchy did to encourage freedom of opinion in the past, and what it would still do today if it could, and does as much as possible, when it has the chance. It is part of the system.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>Hoic About This in America?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">The Ethiopians must be Roman Catholics or nothing. They must abandon their Coptic religion, which is to be entirely suppressed. In chasing out all kinds of Protestant missionaries, even the educational and medical missionaries were given the gate, and that after they had done excellent educational work for fifty years and had a large investment of good will in the country. Mussolini is taking his orders from the pope, and doing just as he is told. And he knows why. There is plain evidence of collusion, for years, on the part of both the pope and Mussolini to destroy Ethiopia and put Roman Cathob icism in as its only religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The official Italian statement of why British and American missionaries were unceremoniously run out of Ethiopia was that the expulsions were ordered</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to cleanse Ethiopia of the missionaries who had been proved to be either secret agents or exponents of dangerous fanaticism and religious disintegration so characteristic of Protestantism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other words, the mouthpiece of the pope told the Protestants that they were run out because they were Protestants, and if they don’t like it they can go and jump into the Red sea. The “conversion” of Ethiopia from the Coptic “religion” (which does not recognize the pope) to the Roman Catholic “religion” will make it necessary to murder some few tens of thousands, and it would be better all round if no Protestants should see it and write embarrassing reports back to Britain and America.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>Wrong There, Right Here</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">The news from Europe was hardly cold, that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy had refused to have anything to do with the Peace Congress at Brussels, and had forbidden any Catholic to attend it, when the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace was called for Buenos Aires and Cardinal Copello, of Buenos Aires, was delivered of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church, which has been called by divine right to be the mother of all men, cannot do less than cooperate with this conference that it may be completely successful in establishing international peace on an unshakable foundation. This good will not be exclusively ours. It will be for all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The incredible meanness of Fascism (Catholic Action) is well illustrated in Brazil, where Louis Carlos Prestes, Communist, was sentenced to death without trial, and his fellow prisoner, Arthur Ewart, is confined in a windowless cell of small size, completely shut off from all communication with the outside world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wives of these two men were sent back to the horrible land of Germany and confined in concentration camps. What became of the Prestes’ infant child is known only to the Rio police. Imprisonment of the mother in Germany occurred when the child was less than two months old. It is typical of Catholic Action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> November 9,1874, Lord Acton (John Emerich Edward Dalberg), one of the greatest scholars the Roman Catholic church has ever retained, made the admission, “The Corpus Juris makes the murder of Protestants lawful.” Stating the blunt fact, just as it is, here in the United States are 20,000,000 people, one-sixth of the population, that are constantly being taught that they have the right to put the other 108,000,000 people out of existence. If that isn’t a serious situation, name one. Lord Acton, by the way, was one of the opposers of the dogma of infallibility at the Ecumenical Council in Rome in 1870.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On March 3,1937, the jury in Coblenz, found Gundram, a monk of the Franciscan order, guilty of deliberate manslaughter for causing the death of Albert Stoll, one of his miserable wards, an entirely helpless young man of 18 years, a very sick patient who could neither walk nor talk and who, together with twenty other patients, was entrusted to the care of this fiend in the hospital ward of the convent Wald-breitenbach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The shocking post-mortem examination showed that the friar had beaten this helpless victim to death in a most brutal and inhuman manner. One of the witnesses, the Capuchin pater Columban, testified that the monastery consisted only, of “brutes, drunkards and pederasts (Sodomites)”. The court sentenced the fiend to only four years in the penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The theory that priests are holy had a rather hard time also at Greensburg, Pennsylvania, recently. A woman was found slain in a cabin. Letters in the cabin showed she was in love with a priest. Officers waited and at length a priest, away from his charge on a vacation, showed up. According to the priest’s story he had merely hired the lady, whom he had met in a beer saloon, to do clerical work for him. That’s good. In ancient times priests were called “clerics”, and, sure enough, anybody working for one of them would be doing “clerical” work all right.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>The Family Fight</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s true people, having no use whatever either for the Roman Hierarchy, the mother of all tyranny, or for her degenerate son, Adolf Hitler, can only view with amused interest the family fight between the two, and feel like giving three cheers every time a dinner plate or soup tureen caroms off the dome of one of the combatants or cuts a biscuit out of his jowls. With these cheerful thoughts in mind one reads with abandon Cardinal Mundelein’s “sermon” at Chicago in which he is alleged to have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How is it that a nation of 60,000,000 people—intelligent people—will submit in fear and servitude to an alien, an Austrian paperhanger, and a darn poor one, I am told, and a few associates like Goebbels and Goering, who dictate every move of the people’s lives and who can say to an entire nation, ‘Wages cannot be raised’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps, because it is a country where every second person is a government spy; where armed forces come in and seize private papers and books without court procedure; where the father can no longer discipline his boy for fear the latter will inform on him and land him in prison; where the young, tenderly nurtured girl is torn from the mother’s side and sent to labor camps to live with the slatterns of the streets in the dangerous years of changing youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moral conditions in the sacred cloisters of German monks are such that his nibs Hitler is having some difficulty in excusing there what he “purged” in his own ranks a few years ago. However, the prosecution of these monks is no indication that there is any real rift between Hitler and the pope. On the pope’s coronation anniversary, February 12 of this year, Hitler sent him a solicitous message with which the pope was highly pleased. When the Hindenburg crashed the pope sent Hitler a message of condolence. The course of papal love does not run altogether smoothly, but doubtless things will be straightened out satisfactorily and it will be proved, in some way, that conditions among German monks were “greatly exaggerated”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholics in Berlin are getting along fine. According to statistics recently released, there are 591,148 Catholics in the German capital, and they maintain 305 churches, a population of 1,940 per church. This would be about 350 families, and would be considered a ‘great big flock’, not a “little flock” (Luke 12:32).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the monastery of the so-called “servants of Mary”, in Rome, there are no windows looking on the street. The food for the inmates is lowered down a chute. Only one person in the monastery contacts the outside world to transact essential business. Can anybody show one word in the Bible or give one sensible reason why any person on earth should live under such conditions ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">IDAL waves (caused by undersea earthquakes) have several times risen to the height of 100 feet; one of them, which broke over cape Copatka in 1737 had a height of 210 feet. The waters first recede from the shore, sometimes to the distance of a mile. In 1868 the United States warship Wateree was carried two miles into Peru and deposited in a forest at the foot of a steep mountain. The tidal wave following the Lisbon earthquake, in 1755, drowned 50,000 people.</span></p>

As the light began to fade eleven tons of intricate instruments began making the technical records that will be studied by experts for several years. During the period of totality streamers of blue light shot outward, twice as long as the diameter of the sun. The sky was in perfect condition for the purposes of observation by the fifteen American scientists that made up the expedition. The island is too small to be found on any ordinary maps. It has no population but birds, and no plant life except nine palm trees. It is 5,000 miles off the American mainland.</span></p>
