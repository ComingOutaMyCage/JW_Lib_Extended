<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creatuie and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind ns expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom beforo all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s mganization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous law’s shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark10"></a>RACKETEERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wicked worketh a deceitful work.”—Prov. 11:18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font3">EIIOVAII has advised his covenant people concerning the way of the wicked in order that the righteous may walk in the way of the Lord and escape that which befalls the wicked. While the words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">racket</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">racketeer</span><span class="font3"> do not appear in the Scriptures, yet other words of the same import and meaning are used to identify the workers of iniquity. Words are employed to convey information. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">racket </span><span class="font3">cannot be properly rejected on the ground that it is not a Scriptural term, for the reason, fraud, deceit and deceiving, which are Scriptural terms, convey the same meaning as that of racket and racketeer. Addressing himself to conditions that would prevail at the end of the world, Jesus’ words show that at that time fraudulent and deceitful schemes and fraudulent workers would be more in evidence than in previous times and working in such a way &quot;that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect”. (Matt. 24:24) It is certain, therefore, that those who are not of the very elect will be deceived by such schemes and schemers and that they are being deceived, because we are now at Die end of the world and the wicked crowd are putting forth their greatest endeavors to deceive. Those who are in the temple with the Lord, and who abide there, are protected from such deceitful schemes, provided they obey the instructions received from the Lord. Those of the temple company yet in the flesh must be instructed, however, as to the ways and means employed by the wicked in working their iniquitous schemes, in order that the righteous may continue to go in the right way and, furthermore, to the end that they may be able to give instruction and aid to their companions, that is, the Jonadabs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The ignorant are those without knowledge; and such include those who at one time were in line for the kingdom but who because of selfishness failed to gain the information made available for them, and the result is, to them, that their latter state or condition is worse than the former. They were at one time counted by the Lord as watchmen amongst his people, but, failing to gain understanding, they become blind and ignorant, and concerning sueh the Lord God’s prophet says: “His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant.” (Isa. 56:10) At the present time there are many of such, and they will not appreciate the truth concerning rackets and racketeers, but will rather resent it. Such ignorant and blind ones are easily deceived by the Devil and by his associates. The “elect” are not of this class that can be deceived, because they are always diligent to ascertain the truth, that they may do the will of God; and because they are pure in heart and are diligent in obeying God’s law Jehovah grants unto them the desire of their heart to know his will and to be led by him through Christ Jesus. Sueh faithful ones are taught by .Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and therefore cannot be deceived. It becomes the duty and privilege of the ‘elect servant’ class also to transmit to those persons of good will toward God sueh information as is made available of and concerning the wicked racketeers and their rackets. What is here published, therefore, is first for the benefit of the remnant, that they may use that information to aid and comfort the Jonadabs, who are seeking righteousness and meekness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Many persons are ignorantly supporting a racket which works great injury to them and to others, and all such persons of good will would no doubt cease to support such a racket if they understood the truth. It is therefore the duty as well as the privilege of the remnant to aid such persons of good will to gain a knowledge of the truth. In proclaiming the truth of God’s purpose controversies should be avoided. The remnant do not seek controversies, but are anxious to do the will of God by bearing testimony to the truth to others, that such others may avail themselves of the privilege of serving the Lord. The truth should never be used as a club with which to punish others, but should be used for the purpose of doing good to those who desire to know what is right. Telling the truth, however, necessarily exposes rackets and racketeers, and such exposure is for the purpose of enabling those of good will to learn where they get protection, that they may go in the right way. To do such work of testifying to the truth necessarily discloses those who are against God and his kingdom, and such truth is a punishment to the wicked; but Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">must always keep in mind that their du’y is to tell the truth as God has commanded, and the result will be according to the will of God, and therefore right; and if this results in chastisement to the wicked, then it is according to the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘ The world is full of wicked creatures, and of such the religionists are the worst. No good can result by abusing any practitioner of religion. Personal attacks on anyone are uncalled for. The business of the remnant is to do good always, and to do so by telling the truth, and all persons who are of good will toward God, desiring the truth, will profit by hearing the same. A debate with those who are holding and teaching false doctrines is not for the purpose of chastising the wicked, but such a debate might be entirely proper for the purpose of enlightening those who are held in bondage, that they might escape. There are many persons who are thus restrained by the religionists and the religious organizations, and such persons of good will sigh and cry because of the wickedness practiced by racketeers; and the Lord God sends forth his witnesses to proclaim the truth, that those who do thus sigh and cry. may receive the information that will lead them in the right way. God’s faithful prophet wrote: “I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.” (Ps. 39:1) Surely this means that the servant of the Lord God will not indulge in controversial harangue with those who are wicked and who are attempting to do injury to God’s cause and his people. When the wicked resort to lies, slander and vicious and malicious charges, the proper course for those who are devoted to the Lord is to ignore such wicked ones; but, if opportunity arises, then speak the truth, that those of good will may be benefited. Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, will be looking out to give the message to those who have an ear to hear. The purpose of giving testimony is not to convince the wicked, that such wicked ones may reform, because that is an impossibility; but the purpose is to aid those who are truly seeking knowledge. The present is the lime of darkness upon the world and when gross darkness rests upon the people, even as God by his prophet foretold. Such darkness is upon those who have been deceived by the racketeers, who carry on their rackets for the purpose of deceiving. It is therefore also the time when those who are devoted to Jehovah God must, in obedience to his commandment, ‘arise and shine,’ by telling the truth and telling it boldly. (Isa. 60:1) For this reason it is the duty of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> to publish facts concerning the greatest racketeering scheme that has ever been practiced upon the human race, and which racket is deceiving and working great injury to millions of honest-hearted persons. What is a racket? and who are the most subtle and slimy racketeers?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> A racket is a scheme, plan, dodge or trick used for selfish gain and which deceives and works injury to others. A perversion of the truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with something valuable is a racket. A false scheme or misrepresentation or suppression of the truth, which results in injury to others, and for pecuniary gain to the schemer, is a racket. A deception intentionally practiced, with a view to gain, is a racket.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>0</sup> A racketeer is a schemer who is artful, wily and cunning and who uses his plan or scheme to gain an unfair advantage over others. The racketeer gains an undue advantage over others, and then uses his scheme or plan to rob or pillage others, and this he does for real or supposed gain to himself. All racketeers are public enemies and enemies of honest persons, and are the enemies of God. Rackets, practiced by racketeers, work injury to those upon whom the trick is practiced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Men who are engaged in traffic that is unlawful and that works injury to the people are racketeers and public enemies. The stealing of children or persons and holding them for ransom is a racket, and the stealer or kidnaper is a public enemy. Men who engage in the white-slave trade are racketeers and public enemies. Real estate promoters who operate schemes to defraud others are racketeers and public enemies. Those who operate a scheme by offering prizes to induce persons to buy or sell worthless goods, wares and merchandise are racketeers. Men who engage in robbery, stealing and murder for personal gain are racketeers and public enemies. The man who engages in the scheme of blackmail and thereby obtains money is a racketeer and a public enemy. All such public enemies cither put the people in fear or fraudulently overreach them. Men who engage in political schemes misrepresenting the facts in order to induce the people to support them that they may thereby reap a personal or pecuniary gain are racketeers and public enemies. Commercial men or corporations operating a scheme or schemes that result in injury to the people are racketeers and public enemies. Those who engage in any kind of fraudulent scheme that results in gain or injury to others are racketeers and public enemies. Men who use motion pictures to mislead the people, and thereby gain any kind of profit in name, money or influence, are racketeers. All racketeers are agents of the Devil, whether they realize that fact or not. All wrongful schemes originate with the Devil, and that great enemy induces and influences men to use such rackets to do injury to others and to bring reproach upon the name of the Almighty God. Such is a general description of rackets and racketeers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GREATEST RACKET</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Put aside now preconceived opinion, and with an unbiased mind examine the facts concerning the greatest of all rackets that have ever been practiced under the sun, to understand the truth of which is for your own personal welfare. Honest persons have some means of protecting themselves against many public enemies because they are warned against such enemies, can see how the enemies operate, and can take steps to safeguard their own interests. The most dangerous and destructive kind of racketeering is that which has the appearance of honesty but which is operated in such a subtle, deceptive manner as to blind the people to the real truth. The credulous and unsuspecting are caught unawares in the enemy’s trap and find it almost impossible to extricate themselves therefrom. The greatest racket ever invented and practiced is that of religion. The most cruel and seductive public enemy is that which employs religion to carry on a racket, and by which means the people are deceived and the name of Almighty God is reproached. There are numerous systems of religion, but the most subtle, fraudulent and injurious to humankind is that which is generally labeled “the Christian religion’’, because it has the appearance of a worshipful devotion to Jehovah God, the Supreme Being, and thereby easily misleads many honest and sincere persons. Strange as it may seem, the two words “Christian’’ and “religion” are diametrically opposed one to the other. Most persons in the land called “Christendom” have been led to believe that the two words mean one and the same thing, and through lack of knowledge of the truth great injury is done to the people. The greatest public enemy is that which operates with a righteous appearance but which is fraudulent, brings reproach upon God’s name, misrepresents his purpose, and thereby robs the people of their money, their peace of mind, their liberty of speech and thought, and of the opportunity for life everlasting. Under the practice of the so-called “Christian religion” the world at the present time has reached that period described in the Bible in these words: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5, 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Do not confuse “Christianity” with the so-called “Christian religion”. The latter operates in the name of God and Christ but is wholly against Christ and his kingdom, which is the only hope of the human race. Religion labeled “the Christian religion” is a racket invented by the Devil to defame the name of Almighty God and is practiced by men, some of whom are honest and practice it because they have been induced to believe it is right, while others know that they are wrong and are working a fraud upon the people. The latter are doubly dangerous to the interests of the human race. Because the name of Christ has been and is used to work a great fraud upon the people the racket thus practiced is the greatest of all. There are many sincere and honest persons in organizations known as “religious” or “church organizations”, and it is with the hope of helping such to see the truth that this publication is put forth. What is here published is not an attack upon men, but is an attack upon the most subtle and devilish kind of frauds that ever existed. Those who desire to know the truth will be pleased to now carefully consider the origin of the so-called “Christian religion” and how it has progressed in the earth.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Christ Jesus is the Head or beginning of Christianity, because he leads and others follow in obeying God’s commandments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font3"> means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Anointed</span><span class="font3"> of God, the One who is commissioned to carry out God’s purpose. Christ is not and never was for one moment a religionist. lie always strictly obeys the commandments of the Almighty God. He instructed his faithful disciples in the Word and purpose of Jehovah God. After the resurrection of Jesus from the dead the holy spirit, which is the invisible power of God, came upon the faithful apostles and they understood the truth as it was not possible for them to understand it before that time. Those faithful men, in the name of Christ, went about “from house to house” (Acts 20:20), teaching the people and preaching to them that the shed blood of Christ Jesus provides the redemptive price for man from condemnation, and that it is the purpose of Jehovah God to give life to those who believe on Christ and follow in his steps. Because those men were freely telling the truth to the people concerning Christ, the religionists amongst the Jews assaulted the apostles and brought them into the courts, demanding: “By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?” One of those faithful apostles of Jesus Christ replied in these words: “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This [Christ] is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”—Acts 4:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> During the remainder of the earthly career of the apostles they continued to preach to the people the message concerning Christ Jesus, his crucifixion and resurrection, and the coming of his kingdom as the only hope of mankind, and many of the common people heard and believed. To offset the work of the apostle, Satan the Devil began to build an anti-Christ organization, into which latter organization many people were drawn. Ambitious men assumed the leadership amongst those who started to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, and those ambitious and selfish men became the teachers and leaders of the organization (Acts 20:29,30), and thus was the organization labeled as “the Christian church”, and the doctrines and practices thereof were from that time forward called “the Christian religion”. The Lord had warned his disciples of the coming of the anti-Christ, that is, those who should deceive the people in the name of Christ. (2 John 7) Such deceivers were manifesting themselves even in the days of the apostles. (2 Thess. 2:7) In this day (1937) the religious organization that has its headquarters at Vatican City, Italy, and which calls itself “the Christian church” or “Christian religion”, dominates the religion of the nations called “Christendom”. As heretofore shown, religious organizations began with Babylon and extended to all parts of the earth. When Home became a world power, which is known as Pagan Rome, that world power practiced the Devil religion ; and in time Pagan Rome blossomed into what is known as Papal Rome, which from then till now practices what is called the “Christian religion”. The following indisputable historical facts should be read with real interest, since they disclose that Rome completely fell under the Devil religion. The quotations following are from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“ROMAN RELIGION. From the time that the Roman religion appears within the pale of traditional and recorded history it seems to have been constantly and progressively subjected to varying influences, both internal and external, and to have passed through many changes. . . . Fundamentally the primitive religious ideas of all the Indo-European peoples were quite similar. Even the Roman religion, in the days when Rome was governed by kings and had already begun to evolve complicated rituals and complex myths, still retained a suggestive similarity to that of India. . . . The early Roman gods were the personification of the elements of nature. The old Roman deities and supernatural beings of their nomadic life, the patrons of the chase and the guardian spirits of the mountains, the rivers, the earth, the sky and the upper heavens gradually assumed more definite attributes . . . The deities and religious customs and practices of all the tribes of Italy of Indo-European origin, which were quite similar, gradually became domesticated in Rome. Naturally as the Roman Empire broadened and became more cosmopolitan, its religious system also became broader and more allembracing. Having absorbed the deities of the Italic Peninsula, the habit of absorption became, with Rome, all-impelling, and the pantheon of the Imperial City, Teaching out its octopus arms in every direction throughout the already wide confines of the rapidly extending Roman domain, and even beyond it, brought new creeds, new deities and new religious philosophies into Rome. Under such conditions as these little or no religious dogma could exist; nor did it. . . . Thus ecclesiastical Rome became as cosmopolitan and eclectic as the Roman Empire itself. This is but another way of saying, however, that the religious life of the Roman community was constantly shifting as the process of broadening continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“. . . Diana, the moon goddess, under one name or another and with somewhat varying attributes, the favorite deity of so many nomadic peoples given to the chase, and in all probability the chief deity of the nomadic Romans, gave place to the earth mother, the producer, the characteristic deity of an agricultural people. . . . Jupiter, the god of the sky, of the upper regions and of thunder, usurped the foremost place primitively held by Diana, the moon mother, becoming the titular deity of the Romans and the supreme god of the Latin races united under the imperial sway of Rome. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;... Juno, the female counterpart of the supreme deity [Jupiter] himself, and the definition of the supposed female qualities of the sky. In other words, she is but a subdivision of Jupiter himself, whose sister and wife she is represented, in Roman mythology, to be. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Next to Jupiter and Juno, his regal consort, the greatest of the Roman state gods, was Mars, . . . the patron of war, . . . Mars, who was especially honored in March and October, was the patron of the opening and closing of the war campaigns and of the sports connected therewith. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“. . . At this early period in the life of the Roman people, the superior priesthood seem to have been almost inseparably connected with the nobility and the kingly rulers, the latter of whom had already begun to lay claim to descent from the gods. The seeds of ancestor worship had also already been planted, a custom which was later on to deify kings and emperors, as the legal and de facto representatives of the gods upon earth. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“. . . It looked very much as if the old religion were about to go by the board when the establishment of the [Roman] empire saved it for the time being. The emperors, claiming to rule by divine right and direct descent from the gods, it was very much to their interest to uphold a state religion; which they did on a magnificent scale, bringing into the national church all the officers, employees and dependents of the government. The state church, at this latter stage, was an immense fraternity, all the members of which were bound, by virtue of their office, to support it. This revival of the ancient Roman religion was, therefore, less religious than political. . . . Babylonian, Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian and Eastern religious ideas found welcome in Rome. The Great Earth Mother of Asia Minor [therefore of Babylon] and Isis, the mother goddess of Egypt, were not only introduced into Rome but their worship, which was accompanied with elaborate ritual and ceremonial, became almost universal throughout the Boman Empire; and such a firm root did it take among the masses of the Roman people and the Eastern nations under the domination of Rome that the early Christian missionaries found great difficulty in eradicating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. This craze for foreign deities went to unheard-of extremes, going so far afield as Persia, from which was introduced the great sun god, Mithras, with his elaborate mystical worship, which became very popular in the Imperial City itself. . . . Thus Rome, bathed in philosophy, scepticism, mysticism, emotionalism and stoicism, with nothing solid to which to anchor, drifted upon the rocks of national religious shipwreck. In this condition she was found . . . for the development of the Catholic faith.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. 23, pages 641-645.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup>The “gods” mentioned in the foregoing are Gog and the wicked demons, which inhabit what is known in the Scriptures as “the land of Magog”. The faithful apostles of Jesus Christ saw the anti-Christ religion advancing in their day and forewarned the people against it. Soon after they passed from the earth the Devil saw to it that what began as the Christian organization was corrupted and turned into what has since been called the ‘‘Christian religion”, and which has since operated in the earth under the name of the ‘Roman Catholic religious system’. The following historical facts, taken from Lord’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Old Roman World, </span><span class="font3">are here appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“In the Hirst Century</span><span class="font3"> not many wise or noble were called. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">... In the Second Century</span><span class="font3"> ... it was a disgrace to be a Christian in the eye of fashion or power. . . . The church . . . was a small body of pure and blameless men who did not aspire to control society. But they had attracted the notice of the government and were of sufficient consequence to be persecuted.” During the second century ‘‘bishops had become influential, not in society, but among the Christians”. Then ‘‘ecclesiastical centralization commenced; . . . The Church was laying the foundation of its future polity and power”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> It is certain that the Lord God had not marked out such a policy. It is equally certain that it was the Devil who was planting and cultivating the seeds of selfishness to accomplish his wicked purpose. The historian above mentioned continues: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Third Century</span><span class="font3"> saw the Church more powerful as an institution. . . . Doctrines were systematized [into creeds and confusion] . . . Great bishops ruled the growing church. . . . The Church was rapidly advancing to a position which extorted attention of mankind [of the world, to be sure]. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It was not till the Fourth Century—</span><span class="font3">when imperial persecution had stopped, when Constantine [the emperor of Pagan Rome] was converted; when the Church was allied with the State, when the early faith was itself corrupted, when superstition and vain philosophy [prompted by the Devil] had entered the ranks of the faithful; . . . when synods were brought under political influence; . . . when polities and dogmatics went hand in hand, . . . that men of rank entered the church. When Christianity became the religion of the court and of the fashionable classes, it was used to support the very evils against which it originally protested. The Church was not only impregnated with the errors of Pagan philosophy, but it adopted many of the ceremonies of oriental [Devil] worship, . , . The clergy, ambitious and worldly, sought rank and distinction. . . . They became lazy, arrogant, and independent. The people were shut out of the government of the church. The bishop became a grand personage who controlled and appointed his clergy. . . . The mission of the [true] Church was lost sight of in a degrading alliance with the State.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUBTLE SCHEME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> The Lord God gives warning to men in these words: “Tne fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29:25) The man who fears that he may lose some honor or other thing that he regards as valuable unless he pursues a compromising course is certain to fall into Satan’s trap. Ambitious men are easily led into Satan’s trap. No doubt the early leaders in what is known as the Catholic Church organization were sincere, but some of them, particularly being ambitious for honor amongst men, and fearing they might lose what they had, quickly fell to the flattery of the Devil, who saw to it that they had plenty of it. About 40U years after the death of the apostle Peter the Roman Catholic ‘‘Hierarchy of Jurisdiction” was organized. After still further centuries had passed, and the people had been kept in ignorance of the truth, it was then an easy matter to induce the living ones to believe that a man whom they had been taught to honor as pope and the head of the Hierarchy is the successor of the apostle Peter. The people were thus induced to believe a great and injurious falsehood. There is no reason to say anything about the man who fills the office of pope, and therefore nothing is here intended to apply to an individual, but what is said is against the office. That office of pope had no existence in the days of the apostles. It was created by men at the instance of Satan, and the first man elected to that office was elected in the year 440 (A.D.). The Catholic Church did not exist until long centuries after the days of the apostles of Jesus Christ, and yet that organization today claims to be the church of Christ, and millions of sincere persons believe that falsehood. Neither Christ nor any of his apostles had anything whatsoever to do with bringing into existence the Catholic organization. Only the Devil could conceive the idea of organizing a great religious system and labeling it the ‘‘Christian church”; and his purpose, iu keeping with his name, was and is to deceive the people and keep them in ignorance of the truth concerning the church of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">God. The church of God, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, is the only true church, and the names of those who are in it are written in heaven and not on earth. (Heb. 12:23) Because that religious organization assumed the name of Christ and stealthily and gradually put forth its false doctrines it has become the most far-reaching and destructive racket that has ever been in existence, and works to the greatest injury to the people and to the defamation of God’s name. It operates upon false pretenses and false teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PRETENSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> A pretense is the act of laying claim to something or holding out to others some teaching or doctrine to induce such others to take a coui’sc consistent with such pretenses. The Catholic organization, commonly called the '‘Catholic church”, is made up of the pope, bishops, cardinals, priests and others called “clergymen”; and all those who support that organization or who are adherents thereof are known as the “Catholic population”, but which “Catholic population” are not members of the church. In the Catholic organization there arc the high and the low clergymen, that is to say, the Hierarchy of authority, composed of men in high positions; while there arc many humbler men in the priesthood who obey the commands of the higher-ups. The Catholic organization has long held out and continues to hold out to the people certain claims or doctrines for the manifest purpose of inducing people to become adherents to or “children” of that organization. Among the doctrines so taught and held out is this one, to wit: That the Roman Catholic Church is the one true and only church. The following quotation is from the well-known Catholic authority: “The true Church must be Apostolical. Hence in the Creed framed in the first Ecumenical Council of Nierna, in the year 325, we find these words: ‘I believe in the One, Holy, Catholic and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Apostolic </span><span class="font3">Church.’ ”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers</span><span class="font3"> (Gibbons), pages 38-42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Credulous persons, who hear this claim and rely upon the same, are induced to act, and therefore millions of sincere persons have been induced to believe that the Roman Catholic organization is the church of God, and for that reason they have submitted themselves to the organization which is ruled by the Hierarchy. If the claims or pretenses made by the Catholic organization are false, then it must be conceded that the people are being imposed upon to their injury and that those who are responsible for such pretenses or false claims are therefore racket eel’s. By what rule shall these claims be measured to determine whether or not they are true or false? The sincere person who believes in God and in Christ, and who is of good will toward God, will quickly answer this question in these words: “The Word of God is the only true guide by which we must determine the truth or falsity of such claims.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Is the Roman Catholic Church organization the true church of the living God? The answer must be, No. Refer now to the scriptures showing that the true church is the temple or organization of Jehovah God and that the one and true Foundation Stone or Rock thereof is the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Head and Lord of the church; and that all others in the temple or church are members of his body and that such latter-named ones must be transformed into the likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ, faithfully following in his steps, and that these are the witnesses of Jehovah God, who arc commissioned to bear testimony to his holy name. The office and mission of the church of God under Christ Jesus, compared with that of the Roman Catholic organization, shows that the two take exactly opposite courses. The Roman Catholic organization is now and for centuries has been engaged in religion, politics and commerce for gain, and is therefore the enemy of God and the enemy of all men. In the Scriptures a “tree” is used as a symbol of a creature or of an organization composed of creatures, and the fruits borne by that tree symbolically stand for what creatures or organizations hold before the people as spiritual food for their sustenance and growth. Jesus, speaking of the same, says: “A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. . . . Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall outer into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”— Matt. 7:18-22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah God has covenanted to give to Christ Jesus and his faithful ones who follow him, and who are made members of his church, his kingdom, which kingdom shall in time rule in righteousness and minister blessings to the people. (Luke 22:28-30) The kingdom of God has nothing that is commercial and has nothing in common with the harsh, cruel and wicked system that rules the world now' and which present rule is under the Devil and his representatives. Concerning this world Jesus said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 18:36) “The prince of this world [Satan] . . . hath nothing in me.” (John 14:30) The Scriptures show that Christ Jesus takes his kingdom and rules at the time of his second coming, at which time he gathers unto himself his church. (2 Tim. 4:1) Jesus addresses himself to religionists of his time and of the present time, and to whom he says: “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matt. 21:43) The Roman Catholic Church organization has never at any time brought to the people the fruits or messages of God’s kingdom, but, on the contrary, that organization has at all times co-operated with politicians, militarists, commercial giants, and other gangsters to rule and control the nations of the earth. Instead of bearing before the people the fruits of God’s Word, which sustain them, that is, the fruits of God's kingdom, the Catholic organization has bitterly opposed the kingdom under Christ. Every religious organization on the earth indulges in politics and in commerce, more or less, contrary to the will of God, and all these organizations ill-treat and persecute tiie men and women who bear the message or fruits of and concerning the kingdom of God before the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INCONSISTENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> The Scriptures lay down the unchangeable rule that everyone who is made a member of the church of God faithfully follows in the footsteps of Jesus, and therefore must do as Jesus does. “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.” (1 Pet. 2:21,22) Again, Jesus says: “Every one that is of the truth hcarcth my voice.” (John 18:37) All sueh must obey his commandments or else suffer destruction. (John 14:15; Acts 3:23) To lay claim to the high office of the representative on earth of Jesus Christ, and then to take the course exactly opposite to what Jesus took, is wholly inconsistent and shows that the claims or pretenses of the Catholic organization are false. Consider now the well-known facts in the light of the above and supporting scriptures, and by such scriptures determine the truth or falsity of the claims of the Catholic organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Neither Jesus nor his apostles owned any real estate, houses or other property. Of Jesus it is written: “[He] hath not where to lay his head.” (Luke 9:58) Jesus and his apostles did not build cathedrals and draw the people into them to serve them, but the Lord and his apostles went about “from house to house” preaching the truth to the people and instructing them in the way of God. (Matt. 10: 5-15) All true followers of Christ Jesus have ever pursued the same course. Constantine, the politician and emperor of Rome, who was a pagan or heathen, claimed to adopt “Christianity”. He became a “Catholic”. Constantine was rich and doubtless had been induced to believe that he could huy his salvation. The following is quoted from Cardinal Gibbons’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font3"> page 134: “Constantine gave to the Roman Church munificent donations of money and real estate, which were augmented by additional grants contributed by subsequent emperors. Hence the patrimony of the Roman Pontiffs soon became very considerable.” From that time onward the Roman Catholic Church organization became very rich in material things. Thus it is seen that it pursued a course wholly inconsistent with that pursued by Christ Jesus. The religious organization, in the fourth century, had bishops and rulers, many of them, and then the bishop of Rome was elected to the office of pope. That was the real beginning of popedom and was more than 300 years after the days of the apostles. (Sec </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font3"> Volume 2, page 81.) Soon thereafter the pope, as the head of the Roman Church organization, began to exercise political or temporal power. Pepin, king of France, after defeating the Lombards in the war, placed the pope as temporal ruler of the conquered provinces. Thus the papacy came into existence as a temporal power by means of a war of conquest, which is contrary to the Word of God. Says Cardinal Gibbons: “Charlemagne, the successor of Pepin, not only confirms the grant of his father, but increases the temporal domain of the Pope by donating him some additional provinces. This small piece of territory the Roman Pontiffs continued to govern from that time till 1870, with the exception of brief intervals of foreign usurpation.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font3"> page 137.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> In the exercise of his political power the pope has maintained his ambassadors at the courts of almost all the nations of “Christendom”. Such a course is entirely inconsistent with and at variance with Christ Jesus, the Head of the church of God, who declares that he has nothing whatsoever to do with the political affairs of this world, because Satan controls them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> From 1870 till 1919 the pope was almost completely shorn of his temporal power, as will appear from the historical facts. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> April 15, 1937, [p. 32-48.) During the period of time from 1848 to 1919 the Roman Catholic Church organization continued to dabble in the politics of the world, however, and to seek to gain political recognition and power amongst the nations of the earth. Immediately following the World War the pope sought a scat at the conference of the League of Nations that he might engage in dividing up Europe when the League of Nations was formed. The pope was prevented from gaining a seat at that conference; but after the League of Nations was formed and began to operate, the Devil saw to it that the papal organization got on top of the League, and it has been riding it ever since. Mussolini became a friend of the pope, and since then they have operated together. “In 1929 the Latcran Treaty adjusted the relations of church and state in Italy. Shortly thereafter Mussolini and the Pope, strong characters both, clashed over the education of Fascist youth; in 1932 the Duce went to the Vatican, knelt in prayer, and, it is believed,'took holy communion. He was an avowed atheist, like his father, in youth; latterly he has become very religious.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Inside Europe,</span><span class="font3"> page 195.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The ambition of Mussolini is to become a great war lord and to rule the whole world by force. The Roman Catholic organization, working with him, fully supports his ambition. When Mussolini began and carried on his bloody conquest against the poor blacks of Abyssinia, and in which war many lives were destroyed, the pope and the Catholic organization backed Mussolini up and “blessed” his murderous assaults. Now the dictator of Italy attempts to compel men and women to breed like dumb beasts for the purpose of producing men to be later sacrificed in war, and in this the pope backs tip Mussolini. A press dispatch from Rome, published by the United Press and broadcast over many radio stations, under date of March 4, 1937, says: ‘ ‘ Italy’s Fascist leaders agreed today on a vigorous effort to increase the birth rate and provide more soldiers for the army of the future. A seven-point program was adopted for immediate application by the Fascist grand council, supreme advisory body, in another of its closely guarded night sessions under Premier Benito Mussolini. ... It was reported that Pope Pius would instruct Roman Catholic clergymen to give full support.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Such a course is clearly in violation of God’s everlasting covenant concerning human life, and the so-called Roman Catholic “Church” is guilty under God’s law. (Gen. 9:8-13) Does it appear that such an organization represents God and Christ, or that that organization fraudulently uses the name of God and Christ as a camouflage behind which it carries on its devilish anti-Kingdom work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> The scarecrow held up throughout the lands now is that of Communism, and it is the papacy that is creator of and is behind that scarecrow movement. Everyone who dares tell the truth about the Roman Hierarchy is by that organization denounced as a Communist. The facts are that Communism has been organized by the Jesuits, the secret order of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and then used as a camouflage or scarecrow to frighten the people to unite in a movement contrary thereto, and which latter movement is fully controlled by the papacy. In this manner the Nazis of Germany, with Hitler as the leader, were organized and now carry on a ruthless, cruel and murderous rule in that land; and which class of Nazis delight to persecute those who faithfully represent God and Christ and who bear the fruits of his kingdom before the people. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany have recently been put to death, and thousands of others imprisoned, merely because they had in their possession Bibles and books explaining the Bible, which enable the people to see God’s provision for suffering humanity. The Hitler government is in full accord with the Vatican of Rome. Would the Lord Jesus Christ approve sueh as the rule of Hitler? Certainly not; and since the Roman Chureh backs up Hitler, that is persuasive evidence that the Roman Catholic organization represents the Devil and is the enemy of God and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> At one time the Roman Catholic Hierarchy controlled Spain, during which time she prosecuted the wicked Inquisition, compelling people to become Catholics or suffer cruel torture. The people rebelled against the highhanded racketeers of Catholicism and organized a republic. Then the Roman Catholic militarists began prosecuting a rebellion against the republic of Spain, carrying on a cruel and vicious war of rebellion for the purpose of again placing the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in control of that country.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The Hierarchy wrongfully obtained possession of millions of money obligations of the Spanish go\ eminent, concealed the same in their cathedrals, and used it to prosecute a rebellious war, in which hundreds of thousands of persons have been cruelly murdered, many of them by Catholic priests. Mussolini and Hitler have supported the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in the prosecution of that rebellious war. Surely no representative of God and Christ on earth could engage in such a warfare, which is in open violation of God’s everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of human life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Since the World War, and since the Roman Catholic organization has regained temporal power, she has become bold and aggressive as never before. A person would have to be mentally blind who does not now see that the purpose of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is to gain control of the political affairs of the world and to rule the people with dictators. The papacy lias made an alliance with the political rulers of Japan, who make no pretense of being Christians, and she there prosecutes a campaign to silence everybody that speaks the truth against Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is vigorously pushing its campaign to gain control of the oflices and political affairs of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but her greatest effort is now put forth to gain control of the United States of America. A book published in 1935 by a former Roman Catholic Jesuit, who manifestly was sick of the duplicity practiced by the rulers in that wicked religious organization, amongst other things says: “In theory, Catholic Action is the work' and service of lay Catholics in the cause of religion, under the guidance of the bishops. In practice it is the Catholic group fighting their way to control America. . . .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“There was a time—it is now past—when only pious Catholics took part in the work of the Chureh. But today many Catholics who cannot qualify as pious are busy about Catholic Action. Catholicism, in America at least, has ceased to be a matter of religious observance. Catholicism now is something that partakes of clannishness, and that is constituted in large part by social and political and ‘club’ affiliations. Among the hundreds of Catholic leaders who arc outstanding for their loyalty to the cause are to be found quite a few who have little if any regard for Catholic doctrines or observances. Catholic Action would be a far less serious factor in this country were its only agents pious and devout Catholics. The starting point of the wave of Catholic Action in this country may be traced back to the inauguration of the National Catholic Welfare Conference in 1921. On that occasion Archbishop Hanna declared: ‘We have co-ordinated and united the Catholic power of this country. It now knows where and when to act and is encouiaged by the consciousness of its unity. We feel ourselves powerful because our reunion has become \ Bible.’ From that day Catholic strength has grown apace, and Catholic organizations have multiplied. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“New organizations spring into existence every month. Only last May (1935) a ‘Catholic War Veterans Association’ was established under the patronage of Bishop Molloy of Brooklyn. Already it has several ‘posts’ and it aims at becoming not only a nation-wide but an international organization. Women auxiliaries are attached to the ‘posts’ under the snappy name of ‘Yeomanettes’. ‘I am sure,’ announced the chaplain, Father Higgins, ‘that we will have the holy backing of Cardinal Hayes and that the entire hierarchy will likewise approve.’ Contemporaneously with the Catholic War Veterans, the Catholic College Graduates felt inspired to do more than they were doing for Catholic Action and to set up a new organization, so that their leadership in Catholic life might become more effective. Father Parsons S.J., explaining the new move, writes: <sup>4</sup>. . . Organize! Pool the intellects and the wills of as many of the graduates as can be got together. Give them a common objective. Fire their imaginations with the vision of a great movement which takes its roots from deep within the traditions that formed our Western civilization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let them be daring. Let them be even revolutionary if the need be for that. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. . ‘Catholic men,’ he said, ‘should unite in order to be able to tell legislatures that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">they must not </span><span class="font3">introduce bills which are inimical to the ideals of the family or the ideals of the Catholic Church. They should organize so as to be strong enough to insist that school teachers who teach “pernicious doctrines’’ be removed.’ ”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Home Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font3"> pages 15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Space will not permit to call attention here to the divers means employed politically and otherwise to push forward “Catholic Action’’, and thereby gain control of America and other nations. The purpose here is to call attention to the fact that a religious organization that indulges in such political, commercial, military and other wicked methods as those employed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy could not possibly be the representative of Christ on earth, and that therefore the claims or pretenses of the Roman Catholic organization concerning its being the church of God are wholly fraudulent and false. Such alone should be sufficient to prove to every honest and sincere person that the Roman Catholic organization is the instrument of the Devil and therefore inimical to the welfare of humankind. If a person desires to jeopardize his eternal welfare by holding on to and supi&gt;orting that wicked organization, which is the enemy of God and man, such is his privilege; but this is a warning, that he may have no excuse for later saying that he did not know the organization represented the Devil. The purpose of this publication is to aid honest and sincere persons, whether Catholic or otherwise, to see the truth, that they may seek and find the only place of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> One who gains correct information concerning the Devil’s purpose is then enabled to understand more clearly what the religious racketeers are doing. Without a doubt the Devil brought into existence religious organizations to defame the name of Jehovah God and to enable men who are selfish, ambitious and covetous to carry on a great fraudulent scheme by which the people are kept in fear and subjection and then robbed of their substance and brought under the complete domination of Satan and his visible allies. Satan’s purpose is to rule or ruin, and he is using his organization invisible to that end. By what follows it should clearly appear to all sincere persons how the Devil has an organization and causes men under his direction to carry on the most devilish of all schemes and rackets that have been practiced amongst creatures.</span></p>

His army is a unit, and from time to time it is for their good to assemble together in general convention. Believing that Jehovah through Christ Jesus directs all things for their good, conventions are being arranged for those who love the Lord, as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Ruthekfokp:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently I have had the privilege of using the latest instrument the Lord has given us with which to tight the enemy, the phonograph. I had such good results with it that I could not refrain from telling about my experiences. Out of fourteen meetings, with forty-two attendance, I was able to leave literature to the amount of nine books, seventy-seven booklets, and thirteen Bibles. This is certainly good evidence that the phonograph is the right instrument to use, and that its use has Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since I am Greek, I have trouble in making myself understood. Since I have the phonograph to talk for me a more effective witness is given; and it results in better placements ami more time and greater joy in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah continue to bless and use you to the honor of his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RICHES OF JEHOVAH’S GRACE AND GOODNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherjord:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">At the close </span><span class="font2">of another month am very happy indeed to send you report of the study attended by the Bethel family in Toronto. The attendance was 15, 15, 11, 15 respectively. It is good to note that all attend this study regularly unless sickness or some unavoidable reason prevent one’s being present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past month we have commenced the study of the articles entitled “Jehovah’s provisions”, and although we have as yet only touched upon the sections dealing with the players and their respective parts in the drama, the central figure of which is Joseph, words are hardly adequate to state or express the deep feeling of profound joy which is mingled with reverence at the rich provision this prophetical picture is to God’s people as food upon the Lord’s table as well as its manifest setting forth of the riches of Jehovah’s grace and goodness to honest-hearted ones who will listen to and learn the way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I feel compelled to mention to you also the delight the family have found in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet, with its cleat cut arraignment of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its teachings. Only the wisdom of Jehovah eould cause this to be produced. Sometimes it seems that we cannot keep up adequately with the wonderful provision of spiritual food set upon the Lord's table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Assuring you of our continued love for you as you serve the laird’s people, and of our praycis on your behalf for Zion’s sake, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your fellow servant by the Lord’s grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PRIVILEGE JEHOVAH HAS AFFORDED</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At an assembly of the Lord’s people held in Liverpool during the week-end of March 27 and 28, when 1,600 brethren representing most of the companies in the British Isles were present, your letter regarding the new campaign of activity against the enemy was read by the British branch servant to the assembled company, together with a covering letter from the British office. This was received with great enthusiasm and it was good to be there to witness the keenness of all present to share in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A proposal was put forward and seconded as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“That this assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses convey to you an expression of their deep appreciation of the privilege Jehovah has afforded us of sharing in this new form of activity, and that all pledge themselves to carry forward the work outlined in your letter with zeal and vigor. Realizing the importance of the work to be done, and that quickly, also the goodness of Jehovah in giving such clear direction through His organization, we intend by his grace to faithfully perform our part to the praise and honor of his name. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The assembled brethren were unanimous in support of the above, also that their warm love and greetings be conveyed to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I was asked to write this letter to you as chairman of the assembly. I assure you I have pleasure in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A. P. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hughes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HELPED INTO THE CHARIOT</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Friends:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Enclosed is one of the many letters received in response to the public lecture, “Armageddon,” delivered by Brother Rutherford in the Oakland Municipal Auditorium on Sunday March 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The inquirer in this instance, Miss Velma V. Ritter, did not even wait for a response to her letter, but looked up and found the San Francisco headquarters of Jehovah’s witnesses, received all the literature published (even to the extent of checking up with a copy of the catalogue and asking for six booklets listed in the catalogue which the pioneer sister who spoke to her had omitted from the total of books and booklets).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is one of many who have, directly as the result of the March 28 chain broadcast, found the truth and have been helped into the chariot of the Greater Jehu, the Conquering King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S. L. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Biievit, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary, </span><span class="font2">San Francisco company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S PRECIOUS TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rejoice in Jehovah’s kingdom. It seems of the greatest privilege to write to you, in this great day of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother, you are doing marvelous work in the name of the Lord. 1 pray the Lord’s blessing upon you. You surely open the eyes of the blind with Jehovah’s precious truth, wlm h is like living waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We get your radio programs from Detroit, station WGR, each Sunday at 10 a.m. We can hear your voice, as if it vvcie you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We live six miles west of Milverton and five miles east of Moulton. Mother and Dad, who are known as Sister and Brother C. Flecschaucr, are of the Truth also. They arc here each Sunday, listening in to hear the “Voice of the Truth”, as though it was a fountain of living waters. Oh, what a joy to hear the word of our Father Jehovah! We surely listen with silent ears to catch our food so that we may not hunger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It seems our radio will not get any other of those stations. They must be short wave lengths. But in spite of all, our God peimits us to get that fountain of water which is a healing stream each Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We can see now, when the veil of the Devil is removed from our eyes, and which has left us in the blind for so many centuries, that the time is here for our heavenly King of Righteousness to rule, and that happy days aic coming for those who obey Jehovah. We hope with patient heart that soon all wickedness will be destroyed, as we rejoice to see our heavenly King tule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With best wishes 1 pray to God to shower his blessings upon you, that you be for ever in the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your sister by Jehovah’s grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MANIFESTATION OF JEHOVAH’S LOVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The voice of man is weak, and of himself he can add nothing to the glory of the great Jehovah. The loving-kindness of Jehovah is boundless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To understand the prophecy of Isaiah at 28: 17, which states, “and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,” is an occasion for hope and joy; but to be given the privilege of carrying that “hail” to the people in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet is a manifestation of the love that the gieat Jehovah has for the people; also the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection,</span><span class="font2"> which will enable those in Judea to sec the abomination that maketh desolate, and to flee to “the mountain”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is difficult with words to give thanks to our God, whoso name alone is Jehovah; but the Scriptures say, at Isaiah 40: 31: “They shall run and not be weary”; at Psalms 119: 32: “I will run the way of thy commandments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the army of a great King, with the Faithful Warrior leading,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother by His grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN UNITY AND LOVE FOR JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greetings in Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just a personal word from a colaborer here in Canada. I wish to express rny appreciation and joy for the privilege I have in Jehovah’s organization—feeding at his bountiful table so wonderfully provided with food convenient, using the strength derived by serving him and aiding and encouraging others to continue faithful and loyal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have read the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font2"> It is marvelous how one by one the false doctrines of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are taken up, their own authority quoted, followed by an exposure from God’s Word, clear, Scriptural and reasonable. How appropriate the name “Uncovered”! and, together with the work outlined in your letter of February 2—-for which work the friends are vigorously prepat ing—it promises to ‘uncover’ the wicked organization of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> under the direction of the Lord, continues to bring the food convenient, the understanding of prophecy, and the drama ‘Joseph and Ills Brethren’ promises to be the best yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The remnant and their companions are now hearing the command “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle”, and in unity and love for Jehovah and his cause will go into action, resulting in a grand witness’ being given to the vindication and praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dear Brother Rutherford, I have read all your writings and distributed many copies for the past seventeen years. 1 have used a sound car for the past three summers, and feel (hat I era personally acquainted with you. I recognize your work and lalior of love in the Lord; and may he continue to give you health and strength and his loving protection as you fearlessly serve his cause and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother in joyful service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">D. J. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ferguson, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">P.S. From October 1 to February 28 I have placed 120 bound books and 2,173 booklets in the hands of the people, kept all my appointments, and traveled many miles in regional service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I want to take this opportunity to express to the .Society, as such, something of the gratitude I have for a long time been longing to express in words. It is my gratitude for the never-failing service the Society, beginning with Brother Rutherford, and thereafter “everyone in his place”, and one with him, is rendering us, all the pioneers, at whatever place on the face of the earth we may have the privilege of making use of the simply wonderful opportunities that are ours. This service of the Society involves big burdens of work and big economic burdens. Our gratitude to the Lord, who puts it into your heart to in this way carry his humble little ones in the glorious pioneer service, finds an outlet in continual prayeis for all of you, dear ones, that he may mightily sustain you all in the work he has given you to do to the glory of the great name of Jehovah. we  </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font2">one with you all: For Jehovah and for Gideon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your grateful sister,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREAT KING’S BUSINESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greeting in our Father’s name Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I, too, like other brethren of tho Lord, can’t hold back my love for you and the fellow workers for your good work in the Great King’s business. I was permitted to attend the Newark convention. I become spellbound when 1 sec the feasts of good things our rich Father lias provided for us; and, bless Ins holy name, he will come out victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Oh, that we  be found always with praise upon our lips in the testimony way, that the people will know how good J. ho-vah is! And when that old Devil is removed, how great it will be! No mind can even think how great tins heaven and earth could be. To give this warning to the people, though the tired almost fall off my bones, I will not fear man nor devil, and will do all in fear of my great rich Father, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be assured, dear brother, 1 am in full cooperation with you. Your sister in the service,</span></p>
