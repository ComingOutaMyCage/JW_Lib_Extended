TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 48-50
Older Ones Have Much to Share




48:21, 22; 49:1; 50:24, 25
Older ones strengthen our faith in Jehovah and his promises when they tell us firsthand accounts of the “wonderful works” that Jehovah has performed during these last days. (Ps 71:17, 18) If you are blessed with older ones in your congregation, ask them about
  how Jehovah helped them to overcome obstacles in serving him

  the increase that they have seen in the number of Kingdom proclaimers

  their joy at receiving clarifications in our understanding of Bible truth

  the refinements that they have observed in Jehovah’s organization
