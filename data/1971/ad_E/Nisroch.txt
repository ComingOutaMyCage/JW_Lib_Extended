NISROCH
(Nisʹroch).
A deity worshiped by Sennacherib the king of Assyria. It was in the temple of Nisroch that Adrammelech and Sharezer murdered their father Sennacherib. (2 Ki. 19:36, 37; Isa. 37:38) Certain identification of Nisroch with a known Assyrian deity is not possible. A number of authorities suggest identifying Nisroch with the fire-god Nusku, who, it was thought, assisted in bringing defeat to the enemy in warfare and served as messenger of the gods as well as a dispenser of justice.
