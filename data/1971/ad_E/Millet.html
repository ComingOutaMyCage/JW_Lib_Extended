<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This translates the Hebrew word <em>doʹhhan,</em> generally understood to refer to common millet, if not also including other related or similar grasses such as sorghum. Common millet is distinguished by its broad leaves and bristly, extensively branched panicles or clusters of seeds. The stalks of the plant are commonly fed to livestock, and its tiny seeds, of which there are many in each panicle, are still used in the Near East for making bread, usually in combination with other cereals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:9-26:4:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:9</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:25-23:28:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:25</a>, the Hebrew term <em>soh·rahʹ</em> may also denote millet.</p>
