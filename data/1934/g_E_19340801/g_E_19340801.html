Y., Wednesday, August 1, 1934 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 388</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">America’s Popular Jobmaster General</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TVT </span><span class="font6">ANY people in America believe that Fascism is bound to come in this country, that when it comes it will be papal Fascism of the brand that overwhelmed Austria, and that the most likely man to be at the head of it when it comes will be one of the most popular politicians of our day, America’s popular jobmaster general, James A. Farley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must all acknowledge that there is a big difference between popularity and honesty. Even the enemies of Charles Evans Hughes and of Al Smith accredit them with a good degree of honesty, yet they were both defeated when they ran for president. Nobody questions the general popularity of Hitler and Mussolini in the countries where they live, yet Americans do not wish to live in Germany or Italy, because they do not have faith in the honesty of these men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About the only time that Christ was popular was &quot;when He fed the 5,000 and the 4,000. It often happened that various ones were offended because He taught the truth. He refused to receive honors from men. He inquired, “How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another?” He said, “Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you!” When He was apprehended, all forsook Him and fled. The visible results of His ministry were about five hundred brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no doubt about the popularity of Postmaster General Farley in his own home town. It is a thing readily ascertained, and makes a pleasant half-day’s variety in the routine of getting suitable provender for the truth-hungry readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A glance at the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Directory</span><span class="font6"> discloses that Mr. Farley is 46 years of age, that he was born at Grassy Point, New York, and is a graduate of the Stony Point (New York) high school. The centers of the two places are but a mile apart, in Rockland county, New York. Presumably they are in the same township. One is on one side of the West Shore Railroad, and the other on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So, up the next morning a little earlier than usual. The 5:40 train which stops at Stony Point has gone. The next train goes at 6:50, but it is an express and does not stop between Haverstraw and West Point. That’s easily fixed. An appeal to the train dispatcher at Weehawken does the trick, and in an hour the train slows up at the little station with its marble slab indicating that it was &quot;Erected 1887”, the year before James Aloysius Farley came into the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Among the Lovable Irish</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The train pulls out, and as it disappears around the bend a little cottage comes into view a hundred yards away, and a pleasant-faced old Irishman working in his garden. “Good morning!” “Good morning to ye.” “It is a morning to make you glad you are alive.” “So it is that.” “Who do you think is going to be the next president?” “I dunno.” “How about Jim Farley?” A bright smile overspreads his countenance and Pat Mulhall manifestly voices his honest convictions when he says, “Jim would make a damned good one.” That opens the conversation and in a few minutes the morning’s work is all planned; for Pat is loyal to the Irish and has lived in that one house 25 years, and knows everybody for miles around. “Jim was born down at the Point; yes, this is the road.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If ever a man was born in a beauty spot on earth and grew to manhood among ideal surroundings calculated to bring out the best there is in him, Jim is the man. Grassy Point is a blunt-nosed peninsula projecting out into Haverstraw bay at a point 35 miles above New York city, where the majestic Hudson river, here called the Tappaan Zee, is at its best. At this point the river is five miles wide. The hills, clothed with beautiful fields and forests sloping</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">back from the river’s edge, give it all the effect of a sizable lake, while the traffic up and down the Hudson puts life into the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Strolling down toward the Point the next lifelong friend of Jim to engage in conversation was Matt Kelly. He did not think there is any chance that Jim could ever be president: that the second time he ran for the Assembly he could not get any votes at all, and that he could not get any votes in this town now: that he has gone as far as he can go: that when Roosevelt is through Jim will be through: that now is the time for him to feather his nest, and that if he doesn’t do it he will be a fool: that his present burst of popularity is like a streak of luck in Wall Street: some young fellows who go into the Street think they will never have any end to their luck: they put in all their savings, and all their inheritance, and in the end they lose it all. “I have seen them do it many a time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Matt went on to tell of his own perplexities: he had lived here fifty years and never saw conditions as they are now, when there is no work to be had for anybody unless he belongs to a union; that the union men do not welcome additions to their ranks; that they insist on business relations only with those that are in the unions; that even the union men have work but a few days a week, and when the poor non-union men get a few days' work on the roads the union men forget all about their union rules and come and take the jobs away from them, so that the non-union man has almost nothing at all to live on. Matt had lived to be about 70 and found these last years hard-going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Butch” Feeney Tells a Lot</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his saloon “Butch” Feeney did not have root beer, but did have ginger ale, and was friendly and communicative. “Stretch” Farley was his intimate personal friend; here was a picture when they were on the same ball team, a group of fine-looking young Irish lads. “Stretch,” called that because he is 6 feet 3 inches tall, and could catch balls far above his head by merely reaching out for them, was one of the best-looking ones of the lot. He had a good head of hair then, but has little now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first time Jim ran for office was for town clerk; he was legitimately beaten by 14 votes, but the election commissioners stuffed the ballot boxes enough that he was nominally elected by 34 votes. Jim knows all about it. He was then working as a teamster for $1.75 a day; he was a good fellow, and self-made; he might get to be governor, but could never make the grade to be president: the reason is on account of his religion, for he is a Catholic; no Catholic has ever been able to get into the presidential chair, and none ever will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Butch” had done a flourishing business all through the so-called “prohibition” era. Sometimes on a Sunday he had sold a hundred cases of beer. He showed the contrivance by which the cases were lifted from the cellar and slid along under the bar, two at a time. It was necessary to keep a man in the cellar all the while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Stretch” Farley’s father was killed at a railroad crossing at Haverstraw. Thereafter his mother had run a saloon for years and “Stretch” and all his brothers had taken their turns tending bar until they got big enough to go to work. Yes, it was true, “Stretch” himself neither drank nor smoked, but he did chew gum to beat the band and helped Wrigley to build up his business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Joseph Osman, Storekeeper</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Joseph Osman, storekeeper down at the Point, was born there and lived there all of his 77 years. He laughingly claims that he knew Jim Farley before he was born; he thinks Jim might be governor some day. He admits that of the several hundred citizens at the Point there are but four Protestant families, of which his is one. Up the other side of the track they are all Protestants. He has seen the Point go up and come down at least six times. Now the brick business is done for, and even in Haverstraw they run only one yard, and that but spasmodically. Tinies were never so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes, Jim was born in the big brick house next to the post office. It is vacant now. Afterwards they lived for many years in the big double house across from the Catholic church, the only church at the Point. The Farleys owned one side of the house, and the O'Grady’s the other. Jim had been town commissioner three times; then he went to the Assembly once, and then Al Smith made him boxing commissioner; after that his work was in New York. When he had first married he went to live up in Stony Point (across the tracks), then to Haverstraw, and finally to New York city itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Up Across the Tracks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘Stony-Point-on-the-Hudson,’ up across the tracks, the scene of “Mad Anthony” Wayne’s victory over the British, is a most beautiful place of trees and lawns and fine homes. As luck would have it, one of these fine homes where a call was made was that of the Lilburnes, warm Protestant friends of the Farleys. When the Farleys first went to housekeeping, in the little white cottage on Wood street, the Lil-hurnes were near neighbors, kept their youngsters later when they wanted to go out in the evening, and the youngsters still delight to be with Aunty Lilburne, as they call her, and to go with her occasionally to the Protestant church which that very fine-looking young woman attends. She wanted it distinctly understood that she is a friend of the Farleys, and they of hers, and that they are coming in a few days to pay them a visit, repaying one they recently made to the Farleys in Washington, at which time all hands were guests of Mrs. Roosevelt at the White House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then there was Matthew Hurd, of the school board, now about 70, but enterprising and alert. He had shoved Jim Farley off the rostrum at the high school, the night of his graduation, and told him to go and make a name for himself, and Jim had done it. He was a self-made man, a natural politician. When Jim commuted to New York, which he did for years, he never got up and left the train, but always went through the length of it, and knew everybody and spoke to everybody, and was liked by everybody, including the informant. lie had been unable to come and speak at this spring’s commencement exercises, but had been invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another prominent citizen of Stony Point commented on the efforts which had been made from Albany to get Catholics on the teaching staff of the high school, but Stony Point preferred to run its own school. The very school they were trying to get a chance to control had been the making of the community’s most prominent citizen, Hon. J. A. Farley, postmaster general, recently made an LL.D, by one of the colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Farley was thought to have been very unwise recently in virtually ordering the supervisors to dismiss their capable civic engineer, Calvin T. Allison, and to put a man of his choice in his place; Mr. Allison, even with the facts before him, could not believe it, saying, ‘‘Why, Mr. Farley is my neighbor and my friend.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Reason for This Survey</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason for this survey is that it is important at this stage to know something about the man who has more power in his grasp than any other man in the country, and that at a time when the conditions are very different from what they have ever before been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never before have we had a government wrestling with the problem of what to do with 11,000,000 Americans out of work; never- before have we had in office a man who literally made a president (for it is universally admitted by those who know the facts that it was Mr. Farley who put Mr. Roosevelt in), and at one and the same time is the Democratic national chairman, the New York state chairman, the postmaster general, and the dispenser of jobs for the administration and disburser to those needing relief. No king ever had as much power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some great and powerful organization, it would seem, must have provided Mr. Farley with detailed information as to just whom to go to see, in the days when he was racing back and forth across the United States in the interests of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He knew just who would be ideal delegates to the Chicago convention of the Democratic party, and those delegates were named and elected for the express purpose of nominating Mr. Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not hard to guess the name of the organization that told Mr. Farley where to look for delegates. One of Mr. Roosevelt’s uncles, so the genealogies reveal, is a bishop in the Roman Catholic church, and it was no doubt well understood in Rome before he was nominated that when he was in office, and the “Holy Year” got under way, Mr. Roosevelt would give Mr. Farley and the Roman church a free hand, and they have had it, and do have it, and it might be as well to add that the American people do not relish being governed from Vatican City, or looking in that direction when they want jobs to keep them alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Holy Year” Planned Long in Advance</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Holy Year” that was to lift America out of the depression was planned long before it started; the depression itself was no small part of that plan. It suited Vatican City extremely well to have Mr. Hoover make as big a failure as he could make, and to help it along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For many years the systematizers of the ‘pope’ have been carefully charting and planning the entire political structure of the United States. They know where every job is and what </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">pays and of what it consists. Maps, card indexes, and all the latest office devices, according to those who have seen the plans, enable a man like James Aloysius Farley, endowed with a friendly manner, an imperturbable smile, and a prodigious memory, to do more in a few months in turning the control of America over to the Vatican than all the rest of them have been able to do in a lifetime. It is a matter of putting the right Roman Catholics in the right jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that of the first 220 postmasters appointed by Mr. Farley, 200 were Roman Catholics. That shows that Mr. Farley rightly assesses the control of the United States post office department as no light affair. It is easy to criticize his sudden breaking of the air mail contracts, but a careful investigation shows he had good reason to believe the government was being robbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Something is wrong somewhere when $40 invested in an airplane engine company will yield the investor a value of $6,000,000 in two years’ time, when $207 will make another man worth $25,000,000, and $2,530 make another man worth $35,000,000. The way the air mail subsidy worked out prior to the time Mr. Farley canceled all the contracts was that 97 percent of it went to four concerns. The companies claim they were entitled to a trial before cancellation of their contracts. Granted, but thev had something like eight months in which to furnish adequate answers to the questionnaire which called for a full statement of proceedings held illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this matter Mr. Farley had the law on his side. It called for competitive bidding, but, instead of that, a group of men met in Washington and parceled out the air mail business of the United States among themselves, to their huge advantage, but not to that of the taxpayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thirteen dead aviators among the army fliers turned public sympathy in the direction of the civil aviators who had built up the flying business of the United States from nothing until it was the best in the world, and Mr. Farley was glad to restore the air mail to private hands. When he did so the average bid was 30e per mile, against the old figure of 42c, and the government will pay out $9,000,000 a year for its air mail service, as against $20,000,000 for 1933 and $14,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934. We mention these items to Mr. Farley’s credit, because he needs them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Plenty of Work as Postmaster General</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Farley would have plenty to do if he faithfully discharged his duties as postmaster general and dropped all other activities. It is stated that on the very day that the president of the United States urged on the nation’s business leaders that they increase wages and reduce hours of work Mr. Farley announced a four-day payless furlough for 270,000 postal workers, and also announced his intention to save another $9,000,000 by lengthening the hours of work. He will not give work to any who are not enthusiastic about President Roosevelt’s New Deal, yet he makes that New Deal run on three legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some odd things happened in June. The Leviathan, an American ship, was ready to sail, but at the last minute 840 sacks of mail were taken out of her hold and distributed among French and British vessels. Four days later the President Harding, another American vessel, left with almost no mail, while on the same day 3,000 sacks of U. S. mail were diverted to a German boat. The public would like to know why such things are done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Post Office department claims payroll economies during 1933-34 fiscal year amounting to $80,000,000. That is a good deal of money to take out of the postal workers in a year, and it is a question of how much real benefit the public in general gets out of such a reduction. $22,000,000 of this saving was attributable to the policy of not filling normal vacancies. In other words, whenever a postal worker dies it is the present policy of the government to make those who live on do their own work and his too. At that rate, in forty or fifty years we would have a half dozen men doing all the postal business for perhaps 200,000,000 people. It doesn’t seem any too sensible as a policy, especially when the government is borrowing $10,000,000 a day to keep the hunger mobs off the streets. What they need is employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Duties of a Jobmaster</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a big job, being jobmaster of the United States, but James Aloysius Farley comes nearer being that than any other man that ever lived. He has systematized the work. He successfully backed a bill to open every job paying more than $5,000 to political appointment. Nobody can be squeezed into any of those jobs without his approval and consent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do the senators and representatives want to hand out jobs to their constituents? There is a list of those that have backed the president on everything, a “white list”. Those not on the ■white list are out of luck. There is an F.R.B.C. list. That means those that were for Roosevelt before the Chicago convention at which he was nominated. Those that are on that list are in better luck than those not on it. Mr. Farley has everything about jobs at his finger ends. He tries to put men where they will strengthen, not weaken, his organization. Give him credit for that. He is not looking for loafers or fools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Farley is very much of an Irishman, and proud of it, which is his right. He wears green socks, green ties, a handkerchief with a green border, and always corrects his letters in green ink and signs them himself with ink of the same color. It is claimed that his speeches, like those of at least two of his predecessors in the postmaster general’s office, are composed for him by Ike Gregg, a former New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font6"> man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He is not to be blamed because of his elaborate office suite at Washington. It was prepared by his predecessor. There is a reception room that will comfortably hold 350 office-seekers, a private office 25 by 50 feet, twice the size of the president’s office at the &quot;White House, and a bath room fit for the ‘pope’ himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And That Brings Us Back to the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And that brings us back to the ‘pope’, and that is where the shoe pinches about Mr. Farley. Brought up in an American town, with every advantage of other American lads, and such advantages as he could get in no Roman Catholic country or community on earth, there is a well-defined feeling that James Aloysius Farley is not true to the people that made him what he is, but is selling out the whole country to the crafty old man at the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It does not set well to read that he has made two trips to Rome, apparently to get instructions on how to deliver this country and everything in it to a group of men that have proved that they hate republics and are ever on the alert to work their ruin. We refer to the ‘pope’ and the priests of the Roman Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It does not set well at this juncture for Americans to be told that the N.I.R.A. is not Mr. Roosevelt’s plan, but the ‘pope’s’ plan, and none can have failed to note that though others have been skeptical the Rome-controlled press, the same press that was a unit in its un-American and unmanly attempts to force Judge Rutherford off the air, has also at all times been of one accord in boosting the Roosevelt policies. It is perfectly apparent that the “Holy Year” was intended to be a “Holy Year” for Roman Catholics, regardless of what it might be to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is charged that on his last visit to Rome Mr. Farley had up the question of planting papal representatives in the American embassy at Moscow, where under the protection of the American flag they could work for the overthrow of the Soviet system. If that is true, it was a sorry errand for an American, and shows, just what we would expect, that the Vatican will gladly use anybody to pull her chestnuts out of the fire, even at the cost of a world conflagration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'‘Stretch” Farley from Stony Point</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here are a couple of items from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font6"> The first is from its issue of January 12, 1933. By this time “Stretch” knew that he was to have the place of Mr. Brown, the man who had </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;trouble with his hat”</span><span class="font6"> and who, as postmaster general, made himself the laughingstock of the entire United States. The item says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">James A. Farley, chairman of the Democratic national committee, and Mrs. Farley, gave a private dinner last night for the president-elect, and his eminence Patrick Cardinal Hayes, at their home, 3 East 84th street. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt and Cardinal Hayes the guests were secretary of state and Mrs. Edw. Flinn, and the Very Reverend Mgr. Robert Keegan, secretary of charities to the cardinal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next citation from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> is from its issue of April 17, 1933, after the lad that got to be town clerk at Stony Point had finally come to be a president-maker, and had delivered the goods, not to America, and not to the Lord, but to the ‘pope’, and that means to the Devil, his master, and it speaks for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cardinal Hayes celebrated pontifical Easter mass in St. Patrick’s cathedral yesterday morning and afterwards imparted the papal benediction upon a kneeling throng that filled the edifice. ... In the front pew to the right, facing the high altar, were James A. Farley, postmaster general, and Mrs. Farley, and in the front pew to the left were former governor and Mrs. Alfred E. Smith. . . . Just after Cardinal Hayes had left the sanctuary, walking at the end of the long recessional, Owen J. McCormack, sexton of the cathedral, came from the ambulatory, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">carrying the high silk hat</span><span class="font5"> and overcoat of Mr. Farley. The congregation stood until Mr. and Mrs. Farley and Mr. and Mrs. Smith started to leave. Followed by Mr. and Mrs. Mulrooney, they were escorted into the small vesting room of Cardinal Hayes, where the cardinal gave them individually his special Easter blessing as they knelt and kissed his episcopal ring.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Beastly Persecutions in Germany </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge J. F. Rutherford</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">rpHE beastly manner in which the Hitler gov-eminent treats Christian people who are faithful witnesses for Jehovah is indicated by the translation from the German of the letter that follows, written by a man who has been confined in the concentration camp or prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It smacks of the Roman influence and indicates that this policy of persecution against true Christians is now being pursued at the instance of Rome, even though a camouflage is put on it by the press saying that the Catholics are not properly treated in Germany. The facts are that only Catholics are permitted the freedom to practice their religion within the borders of G ermany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whole thing is a political move led by Gog, the chief instrument of the Devil, to destroy those who are faithful to Jehovah. These terrific persecutions are but a further evidence that the conspiracy mentioned in the 83d Psalm is being carried out by the Devil's crowd. In due time it will reach a climax, when Jehovah, through Christ Jesus, His Chief Executive Officer, will take a hand and clear these wicked ones out of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let those who are followers of Christ Jesus rejoice that they are privileged to suffer for righteousness’ sake, having in mind the words of Jesus, who said to His immediate followers then, and for the benefit of those who are yet His followers: “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” —Matthew 5:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be difficult to believe that such persecutions could be carried on in this twentieth century were it not for the fact that the Lord foretold exactly these conditions would prevail just preceding the battle of the great day of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font6">Almighty. Those who are true and faithful </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">Jehovah and who follow in the footsteps of Jesus and the early apostles may look forward with joy to their deliverance and participation </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the glorious kingdom of Jehovah under Christ. The letter above referred to follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(TRANSLATION)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren in Christ:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today I have the opportunity to make a visit to Brother W., and I use this to write you something about my experiences in the concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On December 14 there was second time house-searching in my house. The SS found nothing, and they wanted then to take with them my Bibles (divers translations) and also the concordance. I admonished the gentlemen to the words of Luther, “Where is no Bible, there it is desolate.” I further said that Hitler received 20 Bibles on his birthday, which proves that the Bible is a general good. On my energetic statement that I would go at once to Berlin and protest against this doing, they let the Bibles here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was going on my work, and when I came back in the evening the neighbors told me that second time a policeman and two SS-men were in my house and have grumbled that I am not at home. They said I should come to the police in the evening. At 9 o’clock I camo back from my work and then I was going to police. After waiting some time, I was called to phone, and the commissioner said: “Now, Mr. L., you know, today was a house-searching, and there was found in the house of Mrs. NI. a paper ‘Obedience’ (this was a leading article of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower),</span><span class="font5"> and she said that she has the paper from you; is this true?” I said: “Yes, she has asked me for it, because she wanted to know and follow the obedience towards God as a true Christian and witness of Jehovah. ’ ’ He asked: ‘ ‘ Wherefrom you have this paper?” I said, “I have received it without order by the post.” The commissioner said : “When this is true the matter is done, but you must come again tomorrow; I must make a report, it needs not much time, you can go on your work tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the next morning eight o’clock I was going to the police and waited till nine o ’clock till the commissioner came. lie then said that he must make report also of the three fellow-defendants and I must wait till one o’clock. Meantime came my family and brought me something to cat. At two o’clock a.m. the report was made, and on this occasion I saw in secret letter thereby that my warrant of the apprehension was already signed on the day before, that also the calming on the evening before was a coward saying by the commissioner. At three o’clock was said to the other brethren: “Mr. K., you are happy that you are sick, you must not in ‘Schutzhaft’ ” (that means “in prison”). He had a medical attest. To the other: “Mr. AV., the state police take consideration of your five children” (really he was only suspected because of the paper). To Sister M.: “You come to the Regional court.” It was said in a sanctimonious and regretting way that I must go in “Schutzhaft”. Now I was prepared. At four o'clock a policeman made ready his firearm, showed me the guns, and said: “This you will have, when you flee.” I said I will go alone in the prison, and he laughed sarcastically. With the auto-car we now were going to the concentration camp. I shuddered when I was brought to the S.A. guard. I never was punished, I never was in prison; and so now the two-meter-thick walls, the darkened lamps and the word of the SA, a real terror. Besides the pushings I heard sayings like: “Also an idiot of Jehovah,’’ “such a disciple of Jehovah,” “traitor,” “evildoer,” “parasite of the state,” etc.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">cso</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">After the announcing I must stand on the wall and see silent an hour to the wall. Each, passing, of course, made his mockery. I sent many sighs to the Lord. Then I was guided to the hall. Five brethren present there let me know to be silent and showed me the plates: “Speaking forbidden.” As a new I must sit down alone. In the evening my bed-neighbor asked whispering: ‘ ‘ Have you already your good beating ? ’ ’ I told him what happened; and then I must hear that the official beating follows in the next morning. In quiet in this night, and without appetite, I awaited in the morning the destiny. Finally cried a guard-man: “The new-brought Bible Student to the guard-room.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">man of 22-25 years said: “Jehovah has written us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">letter that you miserable creature shall be shooted”; and thereby he played with his firearm. For the gun you must pay ten pfennig, because you are not worthy anything. When I stand unfearful, he said: “You dog, have not any fear?” I replied: “Christ is my life, and dying my gain.” Then I was kicked out by the door. The brethren reported that one brother was boxed on the ears that his ears are sick till now. Meantime were brought four more brethren from R., which had also a miserable fate. Together we must go to the guard-room and sing “You, you Jehovah”. Then we should sing “Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles”, but this we refused and were boxed on the ears. Then we should sing one of our hymns. We said that the Association is forbidden long time and we had no hymn-books; but this helps nothing, and then we sang No. 299: “To the Work.” After repeating we must march through the hall and sing it also to the others in the hall; also in public rooms on Sundays when we were brought out. During the 14 days the Bible Students were the stupid fellows for the guard-men. In the dining-hall we were recommended to cat </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and the books. To the visitors said the guard-men: “These traitors must be walled in and die by hunger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then we came 14 days to Sachsenburg. This concentration camp was especially made for the foreigners and we could have there a little recovery from the depression; but the separating from the family made us unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last markstone was Hohnstein. In snowstorm we came to Schandau, and must stand one hour on the platform. Then we must march through 20-cm-high snow to Hohnstein. I was sick on the joints and have had damages and could not exercise one week. After this training we must work in building streets. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">must work together with ten prisoners, work on a carriage and pair. Without any question the hairs were cut like a convict. What is further at Hohnstein is known enough among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My business is broken; further four weeks’ prison. There is no room to write the peculiars. But I am satisfied that the Lord has revealed now also this matter. May come on the German brethren whatever, the witness by radio and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> is more worth than sufferings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With hearty greetings, joined with you,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brother</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Air Mail Contracts All Right After All</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">T SEEMS that the air mail contracts were all right after all! Postmaster General Farley, in an address in New York city, said: “A lot of people have the impression politicians are not to Ite trusted. I have been active in politics better than twenty-odd years and I find more honesty and truth-telling among politicians than any other class.” Or maybe Mr. Farley meant that Democratic politicians are more honest than Republicans. In this event one wonders just where the New Jersey judge would stand who paid $25,000 into the Republican campaign fund for his original appointment, but was reappointed by a Democrat. The issues are confused and need straightening out in the minds of the “lot of people” Mr, Farley mentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">$100,060,000 Saved by Post Office Department</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Y MEANS of postal wage-cuts and suspended service the Post Office department effected a saving of $100,000,000 during the first fiscal year of the present administration. It is calculated that $80,000,000 of this amount came out of the pay envelopes of postal workers. If it had gone out to them it would have come back in a thousand ways in increased business for everybody.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6"> COUPLE at Merion, Pa., had a dog that ran away from home regularly a little after nine in the morning and returned about noon. It came out at last that he had been stealing rides to Philadelphia on a certain train, and coming back with the crew on their next run. The crew had got to know him and he felt as though he was one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">London claims a dog that knows so well when his master is due to arrive that he jumps up and rushes to the door ten minutes ahead of time, and stands there waiting for him. The tale alleges, to its hurt, that if the master is late in coming the dog does not bestir himself until ten minutes before the time he actually arrives. Untrue, maybe; vibrations, maybe; demonized, maybe. How little we actually know!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And Speaking of Travel</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If there is anything a dog likes to do, it is to travel. Some dogs cry out with keenest delight when taken for a ride in an automobile, even though they be unsafely and ignominiously given no better place to ride than the running board. An inexpensive device can be attached to a running board which will make it a quite safe place for a dog to ride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bal, a German police dog in Denver, visits his master daily at his office. He knows how to operate the automatic elevator, and occasionally uses it to make visits to other tenants in the building. He pushes the button with his nose, and goes from floor to floor unattended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nellie, fifteen years old, adopted the Paoli yards of the Philadelphia Terminal Division as her property. Her job, to which she pays strictest attention, is to keep all rats off the property. She will not allow another dog in the yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dog almost caused a war between Greece and Bulgaria. He ran away from his Greek master across the Bulgarian line. The Greek ran after him. Ordered by a sentry to stop, he kept right on and was slain. The Greek troops advanced; the Bulgarians wisely withdrew their lines. If they had held their ground there would have been a war. All cooled off, after a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">Pomeranian ran for two miles on the I.R.T. tracks between Astoria, L.I., and Broadway, and the motorman slowed down the train rather than kill him. He was going in the direction in which he had seen his master go. A little white terrier puppy on the Philadelphia elevated ran first one way and then another, and tied up two trains, until finally two motormen and three conductors succeeded in catching him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The late Henry C. Wallace, secretary of agriculture, at his farm at Des Moines, Iowa, had a collie, Shagbark, that took it into his head every day, at the same hour, to leap into a poultry yard and patiently nose the Rhode Island Reds to one side of the yard and the White Wyandottes to the other. To do this he had to leap through a window into a barn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Snip, a Cairn terrier belonging to the king of England, is a runaway. He recently deserted Windsor Castle and was captured in a stationer’s shop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last winter, a mile out on Lake Erie, north of Cleveland, an Airedale terrier sat down and froze solidly to the ice. He could not get away. Another dog was keeping him company by running around him in a circle. Two men went out with iron bars and finally dug him out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bosco, a Doberman Pinscher pup, that should have known better, stuck his head into an open leader pipe on the roof of the six-story apartment house at 437 East 156th street, New York. He skidded and clawed his way down seven stories and was caught by a hard-working police emergency squad in the basement just as he was slipping past. His next stop would have been the Harlem river. Who does the little fool think is going to pay that plumbing bill?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two dogs that went astray! The first was sent to a passenger making a trip to the Mediterranean, and was rejected by her. As a result “Biddy” made a round trip to Egypt, but finally found a good home in her native city. The other dog was sent by a friend to a filling station employee in Sarasota, Florida. On arrival in Sarasota the dog escaped from the express office and was later found at the filling station where it was to be delivered, and was found in the care of the one to whom it had been sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Dog’s Sense of Direction</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Far up in Ontario a young trapper accidentally shot himself. He tied a note to his dog’s collar and told him to go to the nearest camp for help. The dog ran through three miles of brush, swam a river, reached the camp, and brought the aid desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nemo made love to the Newark municipal airport. Twice lie was given a good home, once eight miles away, and once twenty-five miles away. In a few hours he was back at the airport, wagging his tail, happy to be back with friends. The men at the airport surrendered after that, built him a doghouse, got him a license, and made arrangements to feed him regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Smut traveled between 300 and 400 miles, all the way from Dauphin, Manitoba, to Regina, Saskatchewan, so that he could be among old friends in the place where he used to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Equally remarkable was the journey of Curly, a dog owned by Ren S. Plumer, of Bassano, Alberta: Taken 400 miles north, away up into the Lesser Slave Lake country, he managed to find his way back home. It took him several weeks to make the trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tony, an Airedale, belonging to the Samples family of Minden, Nebraska, strayed from the family car at Bricelyn, Minnesota, 500 miles away from home. The dog was given up for lost, but after nine months trotted up to the door whining and barking joyously. He had probably traveled thousands of miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bud, a collie, took eight months to get from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to the girl he loved at Fort Scott, Kansas, 956 miles away. He had given Iris affection to the young woman; he did not know that he belonged to her brother-inlaw. He arrived at her door, thin, sore and bleeding, but deliriously happy to be back with the one he loved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An Iowa dog was taken to Florida in a closed box car, a distance of fifteen hundred miles. Several weeks later he was found on the porch of the old home in Iowa. Some humans have a keen sense of direction, but none as keen as this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most surprising of all is the case of a dog lost in the East, and given up for good, which after three months appeared at his old home in the capital of Oregon, a staggering skeleton, to be sure, but he was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dogs Like to Play and Like to Fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dogs are like boys in that they like to play and like to fight; the margin between the two is sometimes not very large. What starts one way may wind up the other. Blackie, Brooklyn dog, was a good ball-player. He was run over by an auto. His young master ran to his side to pick him up and got bitten four times on the hands-; the dog thought the game was getting too rough; and it was, for the four-footed playmate died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Miss Peggy Tyson, Winchmore Hill, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">England, </span><span class="font6">waved three bank notes playfully before her pet terrier. He accepted the challenge, and chewed them to pieces. Miss Tyson got her money back eventually from the government, because enough pieces were saved to make it possible, but she learned something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Andrew Pelton, 320 West Twenty-ninth street, New York, was playing with his police dog Buster, and just for fun made a face, growled and snapped his teeth as the dog poked his nose in his face. The dog took the challenge, and nearly bit his nose off. Some dogs, like some men, are low on humor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three ice men got into a fight in East Ninth street, Brooklyn, in which two of the trio were stabbed, while all three were bitten by a neighbor's dog that seemed to enjoy the fight and was trying to spur it on. Everybody got arrested but the dog, quite as guilty as the other three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hie Egyptian Gazette,</span><span class="font6"> Cairo, Egypt, tells of a police dog in Victorville, California, that killed twelve snakes in one year. The item is interesting in Egypt, and maybe back in America. A dog likes to romp and likes a fight, imaginary or real.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Bad Four-legged Citizens</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the four-legged citizens are not all that they ought to be. The ghastliest wolf stories of Poland and Rumania have been traced to domestic dogs grown wild. A mysterious killer of sheep in the Austrian Alps turned out to be a dog that nobody would have suspected. He never attacked fowls or other animals at the farm. Indeed, a &quot;‘killer” dog never slaughters sheep of his own flocks. In Kansas two dogs killed a hundred sheep in one night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Little red-haired wild dogs in the Congo are reported as bringing lions, tigers and even elephants down with the fury of their onslaught. In Central India the Bunjara dogs eat one another with impunity. Wild dogs have roamed New England and Arkansas in recent years, and here in New York city Spotty and Sheik, ash scow dogs, were put to death for destroying nineteen suckling pigs on Riker's island, at the city pig farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Kentucky the governor of the state, in a 500-word message, granted a full pardon to the German shepherd dog Patsy, convicted of sheep killing. It was proved that she had led an exemplary life until she fell into bad company, and it was acknowledged for her that she would for</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">evermore be a good dog and shun evil companions. All politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the wild dogs are the result of the hard times and hard hearts of their owners. People with no hearts make use of dogs for their protection in the summer, and, when fall comes, abandon them by the hundred. In the city the destitute are forced, in self-defense, to part with their live stock, not being able to feed it. It costs something to keep a dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A city is no place for a dog; it is hard on the dog and hard on the people who want to use the sidewalks. The streets of Brooklyn have become as filthy as barnyards. Not only are there frequent rabies scares, but attacks upon humans are frequent and sometimes fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">France reports more than 3,500,000 dogs; New York state, something over 400,000. Animals killed by dogs in New York state in one year are listed as 2 horses, 1G9 cattle, 158 swine, 12,605 sheep or lambs, 73 goats, 1,235 hares or rabbits and 18,703 fowls. To justify such destructiveness in one state would be rather hard, ■we think. The future does not look bright for the dogs, or at least for many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Dogs Trained in Duplicity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some dogs are like some humans: they are well trained in duplicity. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">tells editorially of two bulldogs that assisted their master in a flagrant swindle, and wound up by giving vigorous chase to their victim after he had handed over his $120.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Lynbrook, Long Island, Kipp, a collie, strayed away from his master, a physician, and got into bad company. Uis new master taught him to participate in holdups. The last heard of him he had been sent home to his original owner, with a reprimand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lenox, Massachusetts, has a dog that has betrayed a fondness for right-hand gloves. He has stolen several of these and brought them home to his master. Left-hand gloves do not interest him, but no right-hand glove is safe anywhere within several miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Coffeyville, Kansas, Mrs. Mabel Wilder is training a dog for the ministry. She has taught her little tan terrier to catch a coin in his mouth after a piece of money has been placed on his nose. Now, no doubt, as any other well-trained penny-snatcher should do, he runs around town with his collar on backwards and a collection basket always under his nose, sniffing for what he can get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rin Tin Tin, movie dog, in his life earned $300,000 for his master. Many dogs learn to play dead, to open doors, to play ball, and to perform a great variety of errands. When Lord Halifax died his dog Gyp survived him only four weeks; nobody told the dog his master was dead; he just knew it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some dogs are demonized; their minds are so clever and impressionable that the demons can and do use them for playgrounds; but, as this article is about dogs, and not about demons, we ignore at this time manifestations of intelligence which have no natural rational explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Beware of Dogs”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lawyers and judges have always had to pay considerable attention to dogs. Birmingham, England, has a law that they must be off the streets after dark. An English judge has ruled that a dog has a perfect right to the streets and it is the duty of motorists to avoid him. At Bloomsburg, Pa., a pooch went to sleep in the middle of a busy highway and 400 motorists detoured around him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In New Jersey, where they imprison women for taking the message of God’s kingdom from door to door, and crowd them into cells, so tightly wedged that they have to stand all night, a judge has decided that a dog has a perfect right to bark at night, and annoy people who wish to sleep. Sixty-six persons testified in the dog’s behalf, led by the mayor of the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At White Plains, New York, it was decided that a dog that is on the property of its mistress has a right to bite a child that trespasses. A Connecticut court has decided that a dog on the property of its owner may bite a peddler, and that means, of course, that it may bite </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anybody. </span><span class="font6">Manifestly a person who knowingly keeps a vicious dog does not deserve to have the truth brought to his door, and would spurn it if it came. Such place may as well be omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Public Utility Commission of New Jersey has ruled that if a dog keeps meter readers away the companies supplying water, gas or electricity are justified in discontinuing service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In New York city alone, in a single year, six thousand persons are bitten by dogs. In one instance thirteen persons were bitten by a single dog. Two dogs at the White House bit visitors to the president. Does it not seem that all this is unnecessary, inexcusable, and will not be permitted under the reign of earth’s rightful Ruler? But now—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Something on the Other Side</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of their general intelligence, and their desire for the approval of their masters, and particularly because of their astonishing olfactory power, dogs can be trained to assist in the execution or the breaking of laws. They have no consciousness of the moral or immoral quality of their acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wigger von Blaisenberg, of Lausanne, Switzerland, has aided the police of the Canton of Vaud in no less than forty difficult cases, thirty-two of which he successfully solved. Solution of suicide cases, prevention of attempted murders, apprehension of escaped lunatics, tracking of robbers, are some of his achievements. He traced a suicide all over his farm and finally stopped at the edge of the lake where the body was found; he found a woman who had been lost in the mountains for three days; he found a farmer’s wallet in a freshly plowed field, six inches deep under the furrow. He knows to apprehend persons not walking on the regular paths, and knows to give warning when a window is open on the ground floor or when smoke is coming out of a window or out of the side of a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Near White Plains, New York, a police dog was allowed to sniff at the blankets of two escaped prisoners. He followed them 23 miles and stood at bay at the barn where they were found sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Auburn, New York, a dog led police to the edge of Owasco lake, where they found the body of his suicide master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Toronto, Ontario, a truck killed a little girl; her canine companion followed the truck and stayed with it until the driver was arrested and taken into court. A New York dog caused the capture of a burglar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Germany 600 dogs are used to prevent rifling of freight cars, and are found efficient watchmen. Whistles are used that can be heard by the dogs but are inaudible to humans; thus the dogs can be summoned without the fugitives’ knowing they are being tracked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At 378 Pacific avenue, Brooklyn, Simon No-veck, druggist, was attacked by four bandits. His police dog Jepp defended him, but was shot. Despite his wound, he followed the bandits down the street until two of them were seized by the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Summit, Illinois, Kaiser, a Great Dane, quite upset the plans of eight bandits armed with sawed-off shotguns and automatics. They held up a cabaret, killing three women and wounding three men. The Great Dane chewed up three of the bandits quite badly and entirely upset their party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Other Interesting Watchdog Notes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Dumb Animals</span><span class="font6"> a lady reports that twice, when the head of the house was away over night, a little mongrel dog in the neighborhood, which she and her mother had treated kindly, came and lay in front of their door all night. It was never known to do this on any other occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Chicago, when a concern failed, the assets were so closely watched by a fierce hound that court action was necessary to protect the creditors. The dog would not allow the receiver to attend to his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one occasion while the famous movie actor police dog Rin Tin Tin slept in the home of his mistress, Mrs. Lee Duncan, at Los Angeles, burglars entered the home and ransacked the ice box without even waking him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Avondale, Georgia, a three-year-old German police dog interposed her own body between a rattlesnake and ten-year-old Frank Shipp, jr. The dog was badly bitten, but survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a police dog, Boy, was beside his master when the latter attempted suicide by diving off a bridge into the Allegheny river. Boy ran to the end of the bridge, swam to the middle of the stream, and pulled him out. And when his master went to prison for his illegal act, Boy lay outside of his cell wagging his tail and supremely happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Chicago the owner of a fine police dog, Nutmeg, worth $600, went out with him on the leash. Somewhere in the crowd somebody slipped Nutmeg off the leash and put Gyp, a plain mutt, in his place. During the night Nutmeg got away from his captors and came home; so his owner now has two dogs in place of one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rags, an Inman (Nebraska) dog, has found and brought to his owner two pocketbooks, one containing $15, and one containing $39 that had been lost for two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dogs trained to avoid beaten paths and men in uniform are used for smuggling contraband into Spain and Belgium. Bloomfield, New Jersey, has a police dog that, before he was detected, carried 44 bottles of milk to dark alleys, opened them, and drank their contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Owners Are Held Responsible</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Owners, properly enough, are held responsible for the misbehavior of the dogs which they own. The parents of a Brooklyn boy were awarded $1,500 damages for injuries inflicted upon him by a dog’s bites. The customary penalty inflicted upon the dog is death. New York state has considered passing an ordinance that any dog attacking an unoffending person or animal may be killed on sight by any person witnessing the attack; we are not sure if this passed, but it was up for consideration, and seems like a good law. An African big game hunter shot through the heart a $500 Chow dog that made for him with his teeth bared in the lobby of a high-class New York apartment house. The owners sued him for $25,000 for hurting their feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Long Island jury decided that Howard Hendrickson, a chicken farmer of Bridgehampton, was justified when he shot to death a $4,000 Irish setter accounted to be one of the finest dogs in the United States. The state dog warden of the county, Suffolk, puts to death about 1,300 stray dogs each year. Carbon monoxide fumes are used, and in four minutes from the time the condemned dogs enter the death chamber their lives are painlessly ended. Police officials do kill and have to kill many dogs by shooting. Chloroform is used in Jersey City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Gloucester, Massachusetts, it transpired that dogs were used for pistol practice in the boiler room of the police station. A dog already suffering from two bullet wounds was tied at a rope’s end while a poor marksman was trying to finish its sufferings by shooting. A lethal chamber was substituted after the story got into the papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since its foundation, in 18G0, more than 1,465,000 dogs have been received at the Dogs’ Home, Battersea, England. About 20,000 a year are destroyed. An odd feature of British law is that the police have to measure and record the length of tail of all stray dogs taken in by them. A good feature of the British law is that any man once proved guilty of cruelty to animals may not thereafter hold a license. When ownership of dogs is in question it is common practice to be guided largely by the conduct of the dog itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cruelties to Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some people are cruel because they were born stupid, and others are cruel because they never learned anything. Nobody but a cruel and stupid person would crop the ears of a dog, yet 20 percent of the pedigreed dogs exhibited at dog shows have clipped ears. The healing process of a cropped ear is exceedingly painful, and the process of training what is left of the ear to stay erect involves more cruelty. The whole devilish thing dates back to the time, only a little while ago, when dogs were fought against one another; they tore one another’s ears, so their savage owners cut them off in advance. Cropping is now unlawful in New York state; it was ended in England more than a generation ago, on account of the cruelty involved. Indeed, England has so far progressed that a bill has been proposed providing for flogging those that are cruel to animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lovers of animal life in America have agitated much against the steel traps that maim so many line dogs. In Dallas, Texas, a veterinarian was called to see what he could do for Loo-Kee-Toy, a Pekingese dog that had lost the use of his hind legs. Now Loo-Kee has his fore paws on solid earth and his hind legs on a tiny go-cart and gets around in great shape. It is not every dog that can afford roller skates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quite frequently the S.P.C.A. people have dog owners in court for failing to provide proper food, drink, shelter and protection from the weather. It is not generally known that because of their superior hearing faculties dogs suffer keenly from radio loud-speakers, as well as from other noises some of which cannot even be heard at all by human ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People that bestow kindness upon dogs often have it well repaid. A New York man, offered the gift of a very fine dog, refused to take him out of the country, where he is happy, to a city home where he would almost certainly be unhappy. The man revels in walks with his fourfooted pal when he is in the country, but the dog is left where he best likes to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A family that took in a mongrel, part terrier, found that their kindness changed its natural snarling disposition into one of confidence, affection, and even what is sometimes described as “'worship’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A young girl was left alone in the country with her brother’s ugly and savage bulldog. It played out in the snow too long and came in shivering and sick. The girl warmed blankets and wrapped the dog in them again and again; now he is her slave for life; if she even touches him he is happy for all day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In France a tourist saw some children throwing a mongrel dog into the surf repeatedly until it was about to drown; he waded in, with all his clothing on, and rescued it. When out of the water, and away from the crowd that gathered, the dog showed the utmost appreciation and affection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">OME time ago, at the Society for Experimental Biology in University College, London, it was pointed out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Blue-blooded animals are crabs and the octopus, while a number of marine worms have green blood; and, in the place of the iron in our blood, the blue blood contains copper, which, even in very small quantities, is a poison to all other living things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Which reminds me of another “silent” proof, to the effect that of all sentient creatures man alone possesses a certain muscle in the mechanism of his eyeball enabling him to look upward, which no animal can do, not even a monkey, without raising the head.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The faculty peculiar to the human race is abstraction. We will say, then, man is an intelligent creature, gifted with the faculty of comprehending the abstract. It is by this faculty that man is raised to a preeminent degree of material and moral power. By it he has subdued the earth to his empire, and by it also his mind rises to the most sublime contemplations. Thanks to this faculty, man has conceived of the ideal, and realized poesy. He has conceived the infinite, and created mathematics. Such is the distinction which separates the human race so widely from the animals, which makes him a creation apart and absolutely new upon the globe; a creature capable of comprehending the ideal and the infinite, of creating poetry and algebra, of inventing and understanding the formula (a + b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">or the algebraic idea of negative quantities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">ASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY was startled by the suicide of one of its most brilliant students, a lad of eighteen. The reason assigned was that he spent too much time pondering the futility of life, or, as the president of the university put it, it was a case of “too much philosophy”. The real trouble is that the only philosophy the young man knew about was the Devil's philosophy, than which nothing could be more hopeless. The only true philosophy (mental and moral science) is that which conies from God, and which rests securely on the statements of His Word of truth. “This is eternal life [the very opposite of hopeless suicide], that they might know thee.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font6"> WARE that there were still 11,690,000 men and women without industrial employment, President Roosevelt, encouraging employers to put on more help, said to them: “It is worth while keeping in the front of our heads the thought that the people in this country whose incomes are less than $2,000 a year buy more than two-thirds of all the goods sold here.” Mr. Roosevelt called attention to the fact that the government is keeping on its payrolls 15,000 more postal workers than it needs, but does not lay them off, for humanitarian reasons.</span></p>

The woman said Arab men are now wearing hornrimmed spectacles and Boston garters, and proud of them both, while the women parade on the beaches with backless pajamas, but with their faces covered with veils as of yore. The man said that American women lose their charm at forty because after that nobody can tell them anything; they become independent and authoritative and will not listen any more.</span></p>

But let the poor, frightened, stupid people who now have them keep them and frame them, if they wish. What is a fingerprint?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">UPPOSE you are in Boston and wish to go across the continent by auto. You are not particular as to distance, but wish to keep down the cost of gas. The route to reach the states where gas taxes are relatively small would be as follows: Massachusetts 3c, Rhode Island 2c, Connecticut 2c, New York 3c, New Jersey 3c, Pennsylvania 3c. South of the Mason and Dixon’s line the state gas taxes are all from 4c to 7c, except in Delaware, where the tax is 3c, and the District of Columbia, where it is 2c. So the route would logically be west through either New York state or Pennsylvania to the Ohio line, where the first 4c tax rate would be encountered. Make for Toledo, and go around through Michigan, where the rate is 3c; scud across the northern tip of Indiana, where another 4c rate is encountered. Make for Keokuk, Iowa (Iowa tax is 3c), across Illinois, with its 3c rate, and thence across Missouri, with its 2c rate. Head west through the northern counties of Kansas, with a 3c rate, then across the border into Nebraska, where the 4c rate is maintained through Wyoming, Utah and Nevada, to California, where the rate is 3c. All states to the north of the route named have a 4c or 5c rate, except Minnesota and North Dakota, which have each a 3c rate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HPHE Railway Labor Executives’ Association has given publicity to the fact that on the Southern Railway section men in February were working three days a week on a rate of 25c an hour, netting them $5.40 a week. On the Illinois Central wages were as little, and the time worked by some men was but two days per week. The Florida East Coast pays section men 20c per hour. On the Michigan Central section hands average $8.28 per week, which is $3.12 less than the relief basis in Detroit for a totally unemployed man with five in the family.</span></p>

All ten were confined in a small area, consisting of five cells with a narrow corridor. The jail was in a basement, damp and smelly, with no running-water toilets. There was a slop jar in each cell. We were arrested and jailed about 10 a.m., and up to 7 p.m. no attention was given us. We then pounded on the door and asked to be permitted to go to a toilet; we were told to use the jars. We also asked for something to eat; we were told we could not have both, but could take our choice either to go to a toilet or to have something to eat. We told them we were decent people, and demanded to be given toilet accommodations. Finally, we were given permission to go to a toilet, the door of which could not be closed; it was more than a quarter of the way open, with officers seated near by. Later in the evening we were given a sandwich apiece, also a cup of coffee. We asked that the men be given a separate place for the night. Later in the evening, two men from the street were put in with us. About 10 p.m. all the men were put in separate quarters. The writer was arrested while seated in a car; two others were arrested while walking out of a house. All ten had to appear before the officer who arrested us; when we asked to see the ordinance under which we were arrested, we were told that is not necessary. The ease was dismissed for lack of witnesses.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">BUFFALO paper says of the arrest of Edward Powers, 26 years old: “It developed in the testimony that Powers in the course of a house-to-house canvass had called at Maloney’s home in McKinley Parkway. When he asked the lieutenant to sign a petition of protest against interference with radio broadcasts by Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, president of the International Bible Students Association and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, he said, Maloney grabbed him and sent a call for the patrol wagon.” The account failed to state that Maloney, after he had thrown the petitioner into prison, where he was kept over night, turned his petition list of signers over to the Catholic paper of the city for “investigation”. As soon as Powers’ case came up in court the judge on the bench, manifestly an upright man, promptly dismissed the charge and then said to Maloney: “Maloney, you want to make a name for yourself—greedy for power. Since when has it become a violation of any law to ring a door bell and ask a man to sign a petition in favor of free speech?” Those who witnessed the trial said that Maloney, while the judge was shaking his finger at him, and castigating him, w<sup>r</sup>as pouring sweat and left the courtroom limp as a rag. The conduct of Lieutenant Maloney in this instance is in perfect keeping with the policy of the Catholic hierarchy in the suppression of free speech and the exercise of liberty. The police in New Jersey have done even worse things. Ln Plainfield, under Chief of Police Flynn, 29 women were jammed into three cells so tightly that they had to stand all night. That is good Catholic hierarchy policy, too; they did even worse things in the days of the Inquisition. The present pope has told the Dominicans, who ran the show in the former Inquisition days, to get ready to do their stuff again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">our plan carries out in America.’ That statement indicates that a plan similar to theirs is being tried in America. When we consider Professor Tugwell’s announced plans for control of all land in the United States and the production therefrom, and when we consider the plans of Professor Berle, Jr., for the railroads and finances of this country, and when we consider the Mordecai Ezekiel-Tugwell-Bankhead cotton control bill and the Wallace hog, corn, and wheat control plans, and the Ickes control of mineral and petroleum industries, and General Johnson’s N.R.A. control of industry, we must know that something is being tried out here. . . . Stripped of all its camouflage, it is the guild form of government, and is the kind of government that has recently been established in Italy and Austria and which will be established in England if this particular group under the leadership of Moses Israel Sieff succeed in their plans. The guild form of government is directly the opposite of the constitutional form of government. It is the Jewish plan of a World State.”</span></p>

Instead, its administration has been such as to increase the profits of capital far and away beyond any increase enjoyed by labor, the consumer paying the increase without the enjoyment of an increased buying power. This is well exemplified by the General Motors report for 1933 where sales in dollars rose 31 percent, net earnings rose 50,000 percent, and annual average wages rose three-quarters of 1 percent. Big Business, proven selfish and greedy to the point that brought economic ruin under the old deal, under the new deal N.R.A. program of self-regulation of industry, is dominating in this regulation. . . . Big Business, our Schwabs and our Graces, have evidently learned no lesson from the depression. . . .

When moving the hand over the ground it looked like a swarm of flies. We have in reality had a dry spell since 1917; what crop I had in the year 1921 would go under a man’s finger nail. In the fall of 1921 I had 110 good-grade Percheron horses that I had bred for twenty years.

<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">AYS E. Crowe, of Ontario: “Reading, in a back issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> of the motley bunch of dominies that gathered together on one occasion to sit in judgment on Judge Rutherford’s lectures, I was struck with the number and variety of religious organizations that the public is cursed with; they all seem odoriferous. While they all have their issues, they all as ‘good trinitarians’ seem to agree on three points: First, in opposing the truth; second, in that they all expect to go to heaven sometime; third, to eat out of the public trough while here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In their scramble to get the most and best of what is going, they make a lot of noise. Some with more nerve than others get their feet into the trough; others not so well equipped with gall are glad if they can get their noses in. So far they have been lucky enough to keep the trough right side up. Some day they will upset it, and then what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I also noticed that some of the religions represented were as old as the activities of Satan on the earth. Unless I have been greatly mistaken in what I have read in the Book of books, spiritualism had its inception in Eden. At least that was the first time that Satan had direct intercourse with the human race. Since then all the various religious organizations, both Christian and heathen, have been more or less chips off the old block. True, they call themselves by many different names; but what is in a name, anyway? A skunk by any other name would smell just as sweet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Methodists Not Sure About Worshiping Flag </span><span class="font6">THE Methodist church is not sure about the wisdom of worshiping the United States flag or any other flag. At the annual conference at Philadelphia in March the social service commission of the church reported that in many instances nationalism has become the religion of the nation, and then said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It erects its own god. Its chief symbol of faith and central object of worship is the flag, with its curious liturgical forms and attitudes, to which the child is taught the strictest allegiance. The national anthem is listened to with awe in a standing posture and with uncovered head. Nationalism has its holy scriptures— the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, ■Washington’s farewell address, the Monroe Doctrine, and Lincoln’s address at Gettysburg, which on the whole are better known to the average boy and girl than the classical portions of the English Bible.</span></p>

An Advent Christian minister said there is no real heaven now but there will be when judgment day comes; a Baptist said there is a heaven, although no one knows where it is definitely located; another Baptist said heaven exists and is God’s throne; a Congregationalist said heaven is a spiritual condition into which we go when we die; another Congregationalist said heaven does not exist as a real place; an Episcopalian said heaven is not a reality; another Episcopalian said heaven is where all good people go; a Methodist said heaven exists in a spiritual state; three Lutherans said yes, there is a heaven; a Methodist said heaven exists but no one knows where. It was a grand mix-up all around.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HE public is gradually being made accustomed by the big newspapers to the thought that the United States government has been seized by the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Thus the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of May 7,1934, tells about the “tenth annual communion breakfast in the Hotel Astor” of the “800 members of the United States Customs Holy Name Society of New York”. The account says that “the breakfast was preceded by a mass at 9 o’clock in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Agnes, 141 East Forty-third Street, where the members of the society received holy communion in a body”. Most certainly any person connected with the United States government, or any other government or business enterprise, has a perfect right to attend any “church” he pleases, but it does grate on the nerves of a real American to have the name of the United States government or its customs service mixed up in any way with a concern that has done and is doing as much to break down true Americanism as the Roman Catholic church has done. Why cannot these men go to their church privately, as other citizens do? Why do they have to flaunt it in the faces of other Americans that they have been able to get good jobs with the United States government, in its customs service, and that they are there, not as Americans, but as Catholics, and to have this offensively paraded in the newspapers, boastingly, it not threateningly?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">PRIL 15, 1934, the “Postoffice Holy Name Society”, 2,000 men, had its “annual communion breakfast” at the Hotel Astor, New York, after they had “received communion at a mass celebrated by Cardinal Hayes in St. Patrick’s Cathedral”. Three weeks later the “United States Customs Holy Name Society” of 800 men had its “tenth annual communion breakfast” in the same hotel. Ere long, no doubt, we shall have widely published accounts of the annual communion breakfasts of the “United States Presidential Cabinet’s Holy Name Society”, the “White House Holy Name Society”, the “Department of State Holy Name Society”, the “Treasury Department Holy Name Society”, the “Department of Justice Holy Name Society”, the ‘War Department Holy Name Society”, the “Navy Department Holy Name Society”, the “Department of the Interior Holy Name Society”, the “Department of Agriculture Holy Name Society”, the “Department of Commerce Holy Name Society”, the “Department of Labor Holy Name Society”, the “Supreme Court of the United States Holy Name Society”, the “Tammany Hall Holy Name Society”, the “Welfare Island Holy Name Society”, the “Al Capone Holy Name Society”, and any other “Holy Name Societies” that are now in the forming.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Lady Looked After Her Soul</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font6">T. LOUIS papers contain a lengthy account of a lady 72 years of age who died and left behind her a nice little nest egg of $1,900,000. Of this amount ten relatives received, all together, J of 1 percent; the other 99 percent went to the institution that toils not, neither does it spin, but manages to rake in the coin right and left. About a million dollars of the lady's fortune will bo used to say mass for the “repose” of her “soul” and that of her husband. The needy relatives will probably never leave very much for the “repose of their souls”; they will be too busy hustling for a living; but they can take comfort in the thought that there is not a syllable in the Bible about masses for the repose of anybody's soul, and any money spent in that direction would be worse than wasted. So they are nothing out; they will live until they die, and that is all the old lady did. The ones who got her money will not have to hustle for a living, but, in the end, it would be far better for them if they did.</span></p>

For it is readily apparent to all that nothing could more dishonor God than a system which, makes Him seem to be a partner in a torturing and roasting business, which is conducted for profit; i.e., the flames are regulated, in time or intensity, by gifts of money to persons here on earth who know how to spend it so as to have a good time with it.</span></p>

They cover the salient, fundamental teachings of the Bible in brief and pointed fashion, and indicate also how certain of the prophecies have fulfilment.

They furnish much food for thought and are the subject of earnest and helpful discussion in thousands of homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HEN Satan rebelled lie was the king of the world appointed to such position by Jehovah. Because of Satan’s rebellion Jehovah gave His word that in His own due time He would take the rulership away from Satan and give the kingdom of the world to Jesus Christ. Jehovah could have done this immediately following the rebellion of Satan, but because Satan had declared that God could not put men on earth who would be faithful to Him God permitted Satan to continue over a stated period of time that the great question or issue in dispute might be tried and fully determined. In the meantime He would have His faithful men act as His witnesses to the name of Jehovah, and when the time limit expired He would exhibit His supreme power, that all might know that He is the true and only God, and the source of all life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than nineteen centuries ago Jesus came to earth, and then Jehovah anointed Him to be the King of the world; and for this reason Jesus began to preach, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand”; meaning that He, Jesus, was the King and now He had been appointed to that high position. Satan immediately set about to kill Jesus because God had appointed Jesus to be King. Satan employed every known means to cause the death of Jesus. The clergy of that day were the chief instruments the Devil used to kill Jesus. (John 8; 42-41) In time Satan caused his wicked agents to crucify Jesus, and then Satan concluded that he had rid the earth of its promised King. He was afraid Jesus might be resurrected; hence Satan tried to prevent His resurrection; but in this he failed. Jehovah showed His superior power by raising Jesus out of death, and then He exalted Him to the highest place in heaven. (Philippians 2:9-11) Jesus was then the King, but Jehovah required Him to wait until the proper time to begin His reign as King.—Psalm 110:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus told His disciples that He must die and be raised from the dead and then He must go away and receive the Kingdom, and that He would then come again and receive His faithful followers and set up His kingdom in full operation. (John 14:1-4) The coming of Christ Jesus and of His kingdom, therefore, is of the greatest interest to all real Christians, because it means the end of Satan’s wicked rule and the beginning of the lasting rule of righteousness. For this reason Jesus taught His followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come.” By constantly praying this prayer His followers would show that they were in full heart accord with the kingdom of righteousness, hence on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past nineteen centuries Jehovah has caused the truth to be told to the people, and some have believed it and have become the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. During that period of time Jehovah has taken out from amongst the world men and women and made them His witnesses on the earth. Now the end of Satan’s world has come. Christ Jesus has taken His power and begun His reign, and now His faithful followers still on earth, appointed to be witnesses for Jehovah, must give testimony concerning the Kingdom. They are commanded to tell the people that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and that the Kingdom is here. (Matthew 24:14) In obedience to this commandment men and women for some time have been going from house to house preaching the gospel of the Kingdom by word of mouth and by printed message. Many people have supplied themselves with these books explaining the truth and have gained a knowledge of Jehovah, and, having so done, are now greatly rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Upon the earth today there is much woe, distress and perplexity, and the Devil is falsely trying to make the people believe that God is responsible therefor. Satan causes many schemes to be brought forth by men, by which schemes, it is claimed, peace and prosperity will come</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to the people. But all of these schemes are certain to fail, the reason being that the time has come for God’s kingdom under Christ to rule the world. Therefore Jehovah says to those who are of good will and who desire righteousness: “Beholdmy servant [Christ], whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the [nations]. And in his name shall the [nations] trust.” (Matthew 12:18, 21) The kingdom under Christ is set up, and it will dash to pieces Satan’s rule, that the way may be made clear for righteousness to continue for ever in earth. The destruction of Satan’s organization will soon take place. Armageddon is near at hand!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">end is not immediately. Then said he [Jesus] unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven. . . . But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her [Jerusalem] depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein. For these are the days of vengeance [of Jehovah God], that all things which are written may be fulfilled.”—Luke 21:9-22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and then shall the end come. When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains: . . . for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matthew 24:14-21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mark’s account (chapter 13, verses 14-19) of Jesus’ prophecy on the end of Satan’s organization contains the same warning counsel: “But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judfea flee unto the mountains: . . . For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What this “abomination of desolation” was or should be was an unsolved mystery to all, even true Christians, until A.D. 1920. Then </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver,</span><span class="font6"> on pages 11 and 12 of its issue of January 1, 1921, said this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a well known fact that during the World War the British Empire maintained a large force of men in the United States, doing what was designated a secret service work. The Statesman Press, 164 East 37th Street, New York City, published in 1919 a document purporting to be addressed to the Right Honorable David Lloyd George, a copy of which was found near 500 Madison Avenue, New York City, where Sir William Wiseman, Chief of the British Secret Service in America, had resided for some time. Whether the document is genuine or not, we cannot say; but it discloses a most remarkable state of affairs showing that it was the policy of the British Government during the World War to institute a system of espionage in the United States, that such was instituted, as a result of which many people suffered because they would not conform to the ideas of the beast. [Revelation 13] That the British Government caused life or power to be given to the League of Nations is supported by much evidence, among which is the following quotation from the above-mentioned document:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We must in short now bring America within the Empire. God helping us, we can do no other. The first visible step in this direction has been taken. President Wilson has accepted and sponsored the plan for a league of nations which we prepared for him. We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admitted on the same basis as our other colonies.’,’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This coercive or beastly power was exercised not only in the United States, but in Canada and many other parts of the world; but through it all Great Britain stood with an innocent, lamblike face, her horns hidden, and claimed to be exercising all power, together with Mr. Wilson and others, to make the world “safe for democracy”. All this power has been supported by ecclesiasticism, Catholic and Protestant; and the beastly rule that has been carried on in the name and under the cloak of “Christianity” surely comes within the definition of the prophet Daniel as the abomination that makes desolate. It sets itself up in opposition to the kingdom of God; and while willing that the people should call upon the Lord with their mouths, yet with their hearts and hands and money they are required to serve the earthly power —saying in effect: 'The earth is ours and the fulness thereof. Let God keep his hands off’—thereby attempting to cause and causing both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to worship (do homage to) the beast, arrogating to these earthly powers that homage, devotion and obedience to which only the Lord Jehovah is justly and properly entitled. They cause the peoples of earth to receive the mark of the beast in their hands (to exercise their energies in behalf of the selfish and unrighteous systems) and in their foreheads—to give full assent to and to sympathize with the beastly order. [Revelation 13:15-17] Can any one doubt that this is the abomination, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, which makes desolate and which is continuing unto the very end?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later, in its issue of November 1, 1922, page 335, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> said in further identification of the '‘abomination of desolation”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The financial princes and the mighty rulers of earth assembled in Paris for a peace conference, and the clergy of nominal Christendom joined with them; and the result was the bringing forth of the League of Nations, the devil’s final substitute for the kingdom of Messiah. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In January, 1919, before the League of Nations was completely born, the Federal Council of Churches boldly issued the following blasphemous statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The time has come to organize the world for truth, right, justice and humanity. To this end as Christians we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a league is not merely a peace expedient; it is rather the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">political</span><span class="font5"> expression of the kingdom of God on earth. The League of Nations is rooted in the gospel. Like the gospel, its objective is ‘Peace on earth, good will toward men.’ Like the gospel, its appeal is universal.” Thus they denied the coming of the Lord and his kingdom to bless mankind, and openly allied themselves with the devil’s scheme, . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Riddle</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has permitted men to pursue their own way with a free hand. The stronger minds have been leaders in the world, and particularly is this so in ‘'Christendom”, which was foreshadowed by unfaithful ancient Jerusalem. These leaders have claimed that they would make the world a fit place in which to live, and would establish everlasting peace and prosperity among men; but they have all failed. Their failure has been chiefly due to the fact that they have disregarded the counsel of the Lord and have fallen away to the enemy Satan. Had the rulers in “Christendom” stood by the counsel of the Lord and faithfully obeyed Him, the result would have been different. They have claimed to be the people of God, ruling by divine right. They could not of themselves establish a government of righteousness, to be sure; and had they followed the counsel of the Lord, they would have gotten in line with God’s way and been fully submissive to His anointed King, Christ Jesus, at His coming to rule in A.D. 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning His coming as world Ruler it had long ago been prophesied to Zedekiah, king of Jerusalem: “And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; . . . I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” (Ezekiel 21: 25-27) Centuries later “as [Jesus] sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, . . . Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matthew 24:3-8) This “beginning of sorrow’s” upon Satan’s world, especially “Christendom”, started in A.D. 1914. The world rulers were warned then, and have been warned more specifically since 1922 by Jehovah’s witnesses; but the rulers have wholly turned aw’ay from the Lord God and His King, who is earth’s rightful Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This w’as foreshadowed in the experiences of ancient Jerusalem, and particularly by her rulers and principal men. The &quot;profane, wicked prince”, Zedekiah, was lifted up within himself and followed his own selfish imaginations, and was destroyed. The rulers in &quot;Christendom”, and particularly the clergy, have been lifted up with self, and have continued on in their way of wickedness regardless of all warning, and have refused to hear and to obey God’s Word of truth. &quot;They know not, neither will they understand : they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes [not like the Prince of Peace, but like Satan, 'the prince of this world’].”—Ps. 82: 5, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this God caused to be foretold to the Israelites or Jews, in the nineteenth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy: “Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel.” (Verse 1) This “lamentation” is a wail or lament now over the leaders or chief ones in &quot;Christendom”, who have ruled and do now rule. What was then and there said by Ezekiel to Jerusalem, or the Jews, has a modern application to “Christendom”; and hence it is important to here consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The members of an organization are spoken of as its “children”; hence the organization is said to be their “mother”. When David, king of the Jews, captured Jerusalem from the Jebu-sites, Jehovah God put His name there and made it the capital organization of the Jewish or Israelite nation. Solomon succeeded King David to the throne of Jerusalem. God promised oi’ covenanted to establish the throne of Solomon for ever, provided Solomon and his house were faithful to G od. When Solomon had finished building the temple to Jehovah, the Lord God said to him: “But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them; then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them: and this house [temple], which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people.”—1 Kings 9: 2-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s covenant, and that covenant-city Jerusalem, was God’s typical organization, and was the “mother” that bore the Israelitish nation. Hence the words of lamentation by Ezekiel were addressed back there to the leaders in Jerusalem, and, in our day, to the leaders in &quot;Christendom”; namely: “What is [R.V.: What was] thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.” (Verse 2) Thus the covenant for the kingdom which God made in behalf of Jerusalem was symbolized by a lioness. Centuries before the making of that covenant for the kingdom God had caused the patriarch Jacob to prophesy over his son Judah, saying: “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: . . . Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh [the Christ] come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” (Genesis 49: 8-10) Accordingly the ruling offspring of that kingdom covenant (the lioness) was Judah. However, this particular “lioness” did not produce &quot;the Lion of the tribe of Juda”, namely, Christ Jesus. (Revelation 5: 5) All the “whelps” of the “lioness” mentioned in Ezekiel 19 were failures; and hence this lioness must represent God’s covenant for the kingdom </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">as applied to the royal line of King Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Whelps</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This particular “lioness” mentioned in the prophecy “lay down among lions”, meaning, among the political rulers of the tribe of Judah and Jerusalem; and she brought forth and reared a succession of kings of the line of Solomon. “And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.” (Verse 3) In the first or miniature fulfilment of this prophecy: At the death of Josiah the king (and a descendant of King Solomon) the Jews took his son Jehoahaz and made him king. He became the &quot;lion” and “learned to catch the prey”. “Jehoahaz [whose name means ''Whom Jehovah upholds or sustains’] was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.” (2 Kings 23: 31, 32) Because of the wickedness of the king, Jehovah did not 'uphold him’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that time the Devil’s organization included all the nations of the earth except the Israelites, and he was now scheming to get complete control of that nation. Through the Gentile (non-Jewish) powers Satan sought to capture Je-hoahaz; therefore verse four of the prophecy says: “The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit [as a lion is captured], and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt” The Gentile nation, Egypt, as Satan’s instrument, captured the king Jehoahaz; “and Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; . . . And Pharaoh-nechoh . . . took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt and died there.” (2 Kings 23:33,34) The father of Jehoahaz was King Josiah. In the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah (at which time Jeremiah became God's prophet) the forty years of “iniquity of the house of Judah” had begun, at the end of which forty years Jehovah God would visit his wrath upon Jerusalem, as prophesied in Ezekiel 4: 6, 7. (Jeremiah 1:1-3) Hence neither Jehoahaz nor any other “whelp” of the “lioness” of the line of Solomon could succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other “whelps” were then provided to be rulers: “Now, when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.” (Verse 5) There were three more princes that ruled Jerusalem after Jehoahaz, all of whom embarked upon a course of wickedness. The “whelp”, or young lion, here mentioned represents those three, to wit: Jchoiakim, Jehoia-chin, and Zedekiah, all of whom met disaster. (2 Kings 23: 35; 24: 6-20) The name of each one belied the real state of affairs. “Jehoiakim” means “Jehovah sets up”; “Jehoiachin,” “Jehovah establishes” or “Whom Jehovah will establish”; and “Zedekiah” means “Justice of Jehovah”. These kings were all workers of iniquity and did exactly contrary to what their names implied. Speaking of these three as a unit, verses 6 and 7 declare: “And he [the whelp] went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men. And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.” True to prophecy, all three of these rulers in Jerusalem followed the course that led to the desolation of the land of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nations round about Jerusalem were against Jerusalem. “Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him [as a young lion]: he was taken in their pit.” (Verse 8) Fulfilling this prophecy: “in his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him [Nebuchadnezzar], And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servants the prophets.” (2 Kings 24:1,2) At the death of Jehoiakim his son Jehoiachin succeeded him to the throne and reigned in Jerusalem three months. The city was again besieged by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and Jehoiachin went out to him. He was taken captive to Babylon; as verse 9 of the prophecy says: “And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.” Concerning this 2 Kings 24:15 says: “And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land: those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then Zedekiah became the ruler of Jerusalem, and, in complete fulfilment of the prophetic riddle, he too was taken prisoner and carried to Babylon. (2 Kings 25:6,7) Thus God’s typical kingdom amongst the fleshly Jews was taken from these “whelps”, the rulers of the line of King Solomon. The house of Solomon had proved unfaithful, and failed. They did not bring forth ‘the fruits of the kingdom’, and they came to their bitter end.—Matthew 21: 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Application to “Christendom”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that Jehovah God caused an accurate record of these deeds to be kept is proof that there must be a modern fulfilment or application thereof to the people or nation foreshadowed by Jerusalem. (1 Corinthians 10:11) The rulers of “Christendom’’, called “princes”, claim and have long claimed to be ruling by divine right or authority as the representatives of “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”, Christ Jesus, and that “Christendom” is therefore fulfilling God’s covenant as mentioned in Genesis 49:10, or more particularly the covenant for the kingdom made with David the father of Solomon. (2 Samuel 7:12-16; 23: 5) The “whelp” (prince or ruler) produced by “Christendom” in these latter times, and which is the chief ruler of the world, is the “British lion” and her colonies, including the United States. These together constitute from the Bible standpoint the seventh world power. Concerning this world power it is written, in Revelation 17:10, that “when he cometh, he must continue a short space”. From the beginning of the British Empire in the seventeenth century until the battle of Armageddon, now so near, is but “a short space”, comparatively. During that time the seventh world power (which includes America) has certainly been a “lion” in its rapacity and in its roaring. The British Empire is the greatest and the chief ruling power of “Christendom”. It has been considered the stabilizer of the world. Just as the first whelp that the lioness took was caught and brought captive to Egypt, so the World War made manifest the bondage of the British Empire, including America, to commercialism and militarism, symbolized in the Bible by Egypt, the ancient military, commercial power. Commercialism is the controlling power in Satan and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the larger supposed stabilizer has been formed in the League of Nations; and this, together with its supports, the World Court, the Paris anti-war pact, and similar treaties and peace pacts, is expected to stabilize the world commercially and bring lasting peace. “Christendom” has put forward this League of Nations as her last hope, following the course of the “lioness” in putting forth the second “whelp” as her final hope. This League, according to Revelation 17:11, “is the eighth [world power], and is of the seven [previous world powers], and goeth into perdition.” Not one of the so-called “heathen” nations, such as Japan, China, etc., had to do with the original formation of the League of Nations. It was brought forth by the British, that is, the Anglo-American imperialism ; and “Christendom” is its chief strength. The King, Christ Jesus, is Jehovah’s instrument for the destruction of Satan’s organization, and will capture and destroy this “whelp” (representing all the rulers of “Christendom”), “that his voice should no more be heard”; and “Christendom” will meet its death in captivity to divine power, as did the last ruler of ancient Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The offspring of the “lioness”, which is God’s kingdom covenant as applied to Solomon’s royal line, was never reinstated. The kingdom was taken from him and given to “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”. (Ezekiel 21: 25-27) So shall it be with the princes or rulers of “Christendom”. In 1919 “Christendom” made this “whelp” (the League of Nations) its hope, and the Federal Council of Churches in America proclaimed it to be “the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth”. Thus they refused to recognize earth’s rightful King, the great Prince, Christ Jesus. There “Christendom” lost every hope of reinstatement, and hence must now go down for ever. Following its action against Jehovah and His anointed and installed King “Christendom” was warned by the witnesses whom the Lord had sent to them; but they refused to heed the message by Jehovah’s witnesses, even as Zede-kiah the king refused to hear the testimony of Jeremiah the prophet. (Jeremiah 38:20-23) The doom of “Christendom” and her League of Nations, the “abomination of desolation”, is therefore sealed, and God’s judgment will be executed against them; and they shall never rise again. Hence Jesus warned: “When ye shall see Jerusalem [that is, ‘Christendom’] compassed with armies [the Lord’s armies], then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.”—Luke 21: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “abomination that maketh desolate” (Daniel 11: 31; 12:11) is the League of Nations, because it is that which is brought forth by Satan through “Christendom” and is made to stand up in the place and stead of God’s kingdom under Christ. Those who now see “the abomination of desolation”, the Devil’s substitute for the Kingdom, stand “where it ought not” are commanded by Jesus to “flee into the mountains”, that is, to Jehovah and to Christ, because in the organization of Jehovah under Christ is the only place of refuge. (In Scripture both Jehovah’s universal organization and His kingdom under Christ are pictured as “mountains”.) (Daniel 2: 34, 35,44,45; Zechariah 14:4, 5) If, therefore, you see or discern that the Devil has caused his subterfuge, the League of Nations, to stand up in the place of God’s kingdom under Christ, then the warning to you is that you flee to Jehovah’s organization, and that you do it immediately. Everyone who has a true desire to be on the side of Jehovah must now signify his intention by taking a position on the side of God’s organization. Those who desire to see the kingdom of God and live under it must hasten to put themselves entirely on God’s side. And why? Jesus answers: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matthew 24: 21) That is the final trouble, and never again will rise up. (Nahum 1:9) The Devil and his organization will have been crushed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH'S witnesses have sulTered much persecution in Bergen county, New Jersey. Arrests and imprisonments have been many. In every instance the higher courts have shown that these arrests were all illegal, hut new ordinances have been drawn and fresh arrests made, with the same results. But it seems, according to the Passaic </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-News,</span><span class="font6"> that when fifty of the police chiefs of Bergen county were assembled, to listen for two hours to plans for a campaign against gambling and racketeering, they maintained a stony silence, most surprising in its general unity. Thoughtful people will naturally wonder why these chiefs are so friendly in carrying out the wishes of the Roman hierarchy against Jehovah's witnesses, and why they are so loath to do anything about the real lawbreakers in their midst.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That there is a new world, a new social order in the making, no one can sensibly doubt. Just what the new world, or new social order, is to be, we are left only to draw upon our imaginations. If we arc to accept the theory of Judge J. F. Rutherford, of New York, who is daily broadcasting by radio and sending out through his organizations millions of little booklets to all nations containing prophecies which he claims are based upon the Scriptures, the jig is about up with us, and this old social order of things, the present world, is due for a good cleansing P.D.Q. He says it will come in the form of a war, the battle of Armageddon, as foretold by the Scriptures, which will make all prior scraps look like a nickel with a hole punched in it. The judge’s little booklet entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font5"> published last year and now being sent all over the world, is nothing short of sensational—to the extent of being alarming—if believed. He says, in substance, that a general cleanup is necessary, for the Devil is in the saddle and riding deep, and that the battle of Armageddon, which in Scripture means the place of assembly of Jehovah’s troops, will start soon. The only thing we feel sure of is, there is to be a new world.</span></p>
