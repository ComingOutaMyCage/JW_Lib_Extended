<p><span class="font4">“Uy </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, 0 king, have I done no hurt.”—Dan. 6: 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH uses the lion as a symbol of justice and judgment. Christ Jesus is the judicial officer of Jehovah to whom is committed all judgment in heaven and in earth, together with the authority and power to execute judgment. (John 5:22-27) Jesus Christ is therefore appropriately named &quot;The Lion of the tribe of Juda”. Of all who praise and serve Jehovah, Christ Jesus is the Head and chief. His judgments are in strict harmony with justice. To the workers of iniquity Christ Jesus, the Executioner of Jehovah’s judgment, is a power of evil, but to those who love and serve Jehovah the Chief Officer is a shield and strength and protection. (Phil. 4:13;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1 Tim. 1:12) It is by the grace of God through Christ Jesus that the victory for the faithful is gained.—1 Cor. 15: 57.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* In the construction and operation of his organization Satan has attempted to mimic Jehovah, and by this means he has succeeded in bringing much reproach upon the name of the Most High. Satan uses the lion to represent his law, his abortive justice, and his judgments. In Satan’s organization men are condemned to death and are often literally thrown to the lions for execution, and the multitude, beholding the infliction of the penalty of the law, wag their heads and remark: ‘ ‘ That man got justice. ’ ’ But in this they are wrong. For centuries men have organized governments, made laws, and attempted to administer them in the way of justice, but in almost every instance they have failed and their failures have been due to the power and influence of the wicked one, Satan. In the world the failure of the law and justice to go hand in hand has caused the people to have little respect for the law and also has caused them to greatly reproach the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> &quot;The law of Jehovah is perfect, . . . the [judgments] of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether.” (Ps. 19: 7, 9, A.Z2.V.) &quot;0 Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.” (Ps. 89: 8,14) It is profitable to keep in mind the proper meaning of law, justice and judgment. The law of God is his perfect rule of action. Justice is that which is right, righteous, pure and equitable. It is the strict conformity to the principles of righteousness and rectitude. Judgment means the finding or conclusion of the court based upon the facts, that is to say, the judicial determination or decree rendered by one having authority so to do. All of Jehovah’s judgments are just, true and righteous, and are in exact harmony with his perfect law. Likewise all the judgments of Christ Jesus are just, true and righteous and in harmony with the divine law.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘With Jehovah his law and equity are the same. That is not true in the organizations of men under the control of Satan. Because of the harshness and inflexibility of the law of the governments the nations long ago found it necessary, in order to more nearly render justice between men, to establish courts of equity. Law courts often render judgments that are not only very unjust but shockingly cruel and oppressive. Courts of equity attempt to render justice regardless of the fixed rules of law; hence the rules of equity are more bending or flexible, and an honest judge in chancery may render a just judgment. In the organization of the world the inflexible legal rule is that ignorance of the law excuses no man, and the enforcement of this rule often results in very great injustice. In Jehovah’s organization ignorance of the law is an excuse or defense. (Acts 3:17; 17: 30; Heb. 5: 2; 1 Tim. 1:13) Because of his rule of righteousness Jehovah always brings notice to the wrongdoer before he pronounces judgment against him and executes that judgment. Jehovah’s law judges no man without first giving him a hearing and opportunity to make his defense or excuse for his action.—John 7:51.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Men who organize and rule the nations of the world frequently make and enforce laws exactly contrary to justice. With them law and justice do not mean the same thing, even though the ruling element attempts to induce the common people to be-lievc that law and justice are one and the same. Often v.hen laws that are proper in themselves are improperly construed and enforced the result is great injustice against the person. When the religious organizations, such as the Catholic hierarchy, find it desirable to rid themselves of annoyance created by Jehovah’s witnesses’ telling the truth, that politicalreligious organization brings forth a scheme to accomplish its purpose in an apparently lawful manner. The Catholic hierarchy widely advertises itself as strictly adhering to and obeying the law, while at the same time violating the spirit of the law in almost every instance. If a person is found doing something that is displeasing to the Catholic hierarchy and its agents, at once an effort is made to find some “lawful means’’ by which the supposed offender may be apprehended and severely punished. This is very often true, even though the one charged with wrongdoing is at the time proceeding exactly in accordance with God’s law. The law of men makes it unlawful for a person to go from house to house and sell goods, wares and merchandise. The law of God commands his witnesses to go from house to house and preach the gospel of his kingdom, and it is the duty of God’s servants to obey this law. When they do so in obedience to God’s commandments the ecclesiastics, particularly the Catholic hierarchy and their agents, misapply and misconstrue the law of the land and insist that Jehovah’s witnesses should be severely punished, on the theory that they are violating the laws of commerce, although thej- well know that Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in a commercial work. The real purpose of the hierarchy and their agents is to rid the community of Jehovah’s witnesses; and the real and primary author of their unjust scheme and procedure is Satan the Devil. This is proof that the Catholic hierarchy and its agents form a part of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> A striking example of the injustice of certain laws and the enforcement thereof is found in the sixth chapter of the prophecy by Daniel. Since we are advised that whatsoever things were written aforetime in the Scriptures were written for our learning that we may have comfort and continue in patience and be strong in hope, we must be assured that this record concerning the prophet Daniel was written and kept for the benefit of us who in tlo-se last days are endeavoring to serve Jehovah according to his commandments. (Rom. 15:4) As we see and appreciate Jehovah’s dealings with his faithful servant Daniel we can have strong consolation in the experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses in these days, and may confidently hope that God will supply all the needed protection for his faithful witnesses. The rulers of “Christendom”, and particularly the religious element thereof, have a strong desire to be rid of Jehovah’s witnesses because such witnesses tell the truth and the truth exposes the sins and delinquencies of the religionists. The experience of Daniel aids us in understanding wliy Jehovah’s witnesses continue to suffer at the hands of men who proceed against them under laws that are conceived in malice and enforced in wickedness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> The record of the sixth chapter of Daniel’s prophecy following immediately upon the fall of Babylon and the coming into power of Darius the Mede, the king, Darius, here appears to picture Jehovah God in whom supreme regal power is vested and who assumes rulership over the world from and after 1914. Satan was then east out of heaven, and from and after 1918 Darius, whose name means “coercer, conservator”, pictured Jehovah exercising his power in things pertaining to the earth. The sixth chapter of Daniel opens with the statement: “It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom.” —Dan. 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EPITOME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> To aid one in the examination- of this prophecy it seems well to here set out an epitome of the prophecy, to wit: Darius the king pictured supreme regal power; Daniel pictured Christ Je»us, the Judge of all things in heaven and earth; Daniel also pictured Jehovah’s elect servant, of which Christ Jesus is the Head and chief and which includes the faithful remnant who are joined together with Christ Jesus in the covenant for the kingdom. Thore also piomineutly appears in the prophecy a representation of the League of Nations, and of “the man of sin”; also the elements of Satan’s organization, both invisible mid visible, under the immediate leadership of Gog in his attempt Io destroy the remnant who are Jehovah's witnesses; and the lions, picturing justice of Almighty God; and the power of Jehovah Ged shutting the mouths of those wild beasts, foreshadowing the protection of those who are wholly devoted to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> In 1914 Jehovah began the exercise of his power over things in the earth by then placing his King upon his throne and sending him forth to rule and to cast Satan out of heaven and down to the earth. (L’ss. 2:6; 110:1,2; Rev. 12:1-5) By 1918 Satan and his wicked angels had been east out of heaven and down to the earth. The prophecy of Daniel states that “it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom . . . presidents”, or satraps; and even so it pleased Jehovah God to set his ruler.Jnp over the earth, particularly from and after 1918. The three presidents, or satraps, set up by Darius the Mede included Daniel as one of them, and Daniel was the only one amongst them that served Jehovah God. Since the year 191s the onlj' class of persons who claim to serve Jehovah God, and who in truth and in fact do so, is the temple company under Christ. When the World War ended, “Christendom's” leaders called attention to the fact that the time for the Kingdom had come, assumed to represent God on earth, and proceeded to set up an organization calk-d the League of Nations and designated it as the expression of God’s kingdom on earth. The highest court in America also rendered a judicial decision announcing that “the United States of America is a Christian nation’’. Approximately at the same time the “man of sin” class, “Ilie son of perdition,” set itself up as the representative of Jehovah God.—2 Thess. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Seeing that the kingdom was set up, and the judgments of Jehovah Ged began in 1918, why should he permit wicked ones to assume to represent the kingdom on earth and still continue in their wieked practices? This was foreshadowed by the act of Darius setting the, satraps over Mcdo-Persia. The kingdom of God is pictured by a great house. It is written in the Scriptures: “Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.” (2 Tim. 2:19,20) Thus it is seen that amongst those who name and serve Jehovah God there are vessels of honor and vessels of dishonor. The vessels of honor arc those truly and faithfully devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom interests. The vessels of dishonor are those assuming to represent God and who misuse their opportunities because of their selfishness and wickedness. Many have been perplexed and anxious to understand why Jehovah would permit the wieked clement to continue to exercise power over the earth after he has set his King upon his holy hill and caused him to begin his judgments. Manifestly the reason is, as appears from the Scriptures and facts, that Jehovah might cause a witness to be given of and concerning his name and that lie might manifest his supreme power and demonstrate to all creation his supremacy and his riches of glory on those who are true and faithful to him. “What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which be had afore prepared unto glory.” (Rom. 9:22,23) This is also shown by God’s dealing with Pharaoh, which foreshadows his permission or his sufferance of the operations of Satan to continue in the earth after the coming of the King, Christ Jesus: “For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all Ilie earth.”—Rom. 9:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The beginning of judgment by the great Judge Christ Jesus, in 1918, marks the time for the beginning of the testing of all creatures who claim to be servants of Jehovah God and his kingdom. Whether the end of that testing be “honour” or “dishonour” and “destruction” is determined by the course of action taken with reference to God’s kingdom intereds. Those of “organized Christianity”, which is called “Christendom”, and particularly the ecclesiastic,: 1 element thereof, take unto themselves the honor of the kingdom covenant with God. The rulers set up the League of Nations as a. substitute for God's kingdom, and hence cause it to stand “in the holy place”, “where it ought not” to stand; “the man of sin,” while claiming to represent God, joins in the conspiracy against Jehovah’s faithful remnant; while the remnant, to whom the testimony of Jesus Christ is committed concerning the kingdom, continues to faithfully advertise the King and the kingdom. Respectively these classes show by the course of action taken whether they are vessels of dishonor or vessels of honor. The faithful ones who constitute the remnant Jehovah God has “set” in his own appointed way to perform his will. (Rom. 8: 29, 30) The others above named assume to represent God, and hence, by their assumption they place themselves in an implied covenant to truly represent the kingdom of God but, on the contrary, they are opposed to the kingdom of God and hence are vessels of dishonor. Due to its vast colonial possessions and mandates by the League of Nations “Christendom” has its ruling power operating practically throughout the entire earth. This was foreshadowed by the 120 satraps of the empire of Medo-l’ersia scattered throughout the various provinces. Jehovah’s witnesses, the remnant on earth, continue to push the work of giving testimony throntrh-out the earth of and concerning the kingdom, and this greatly annoys “Christendom’s” ruling power, and particularly the religious clement thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The ruling group now on earth and who have assumed to represent God’s kingdom on earth were foreshadowed in the prophecy of Daniel, as it is written: “And over these three presidents, of whom Daniel was first [was one]; that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.” (Dan. 6:2) The three presidents here specifically mentioned foreshadowed the super-ruling group, (1) the League of Nations, that is caused to stand in the holy place (Matt. 24:15); (2) the “evil servant” or “man of sin” company, which first buries in the ground its “one talent”, and then exalts itself against God’s kingdom, and which has become a part of the mystery of lawlessness (Matt. 25:18.24,25; 2 Thess. 2:3-12); and (3) Jehovah’s witnesses, “the faithful and wise servant,” to the members of which are committed all the goods or kingdom interests of the King, and which faithful remnant deliver &quot;the testimony of Jesus Christ according to the commandments of Jehovah God. (Matt. 24:45-47; Rev. 12; 17) Daniel “was one” and the only real one of the presidents or satraps, and even so now Jehovah's remnant, who are his witnesses, are the first and only real ones who may speak with authority from the King and to whom the King has duly delegated authority to speak in his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Daniel stood head and shoulders above the other satraps; meaning that he was preferred above the others because he was an honest and faithful man: ‘‘Then this Daniel was preferred [distinguished, Tt.Vh] above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.” (Dan. 6:3) It is even so in these days, that Jehovah’s witnesses have a distinguishing mark above all others who claim to speak in the name of Jehovah God, and even the common people can see that. Jehovah showed his preference for such in 1922 by pouring out of his spirit upon all truly devoted to him and the giving to such the glory or honor of bearing his name, which honor ho gives to none save the elect servant class. (Joel 2:28,29; Isa. 41:1-8) The faithful servant is greatly blessed, and in harmony therewith Jesus said: “Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.” (Matt. 24:46,47) Thus it is seen that Daniel in this respect foreshadowed the “faithful and wise servant” class, otherwise called the remnant of Jehovah’s organization yet on earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>M</sup> Jehovah’s expressed thoughts disclose his purpose. The prophecy states: “The king thought to set him [Daniel | over the whole realm”; and even so Jehovah purposed to set Christ Jesus and his faithful associates over the entire world. In due time the “League of Nations” group and the “man of sin” group will be put completely out of business, and the remnant with Christ Jesus will reign. It is a fixed rule of Jehovah that men must be put to the test to determine their integrity. The faithful, because of their faithfulness, suffer, but, as it is written, ‘if we suffer with him, we shall reign with him.’ (2 Tim. 2:12) It is further written: “And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.” (Rev. 5:10) The peculiar and special test upon the remnant from 1918 onward until the enemy is completely cleared out at Armageddon is had in order to prove that such are ‘vessels of honor’ maintaining their integrity towards Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> A conspiracy against Daniel was formed by the other presidents or satraps, which conspiracy was conceived in malice and born in iniquity. “Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.” (Dan. 6; 4) The two other presidents aside from Daniel foreshadowed the “League of Nations”, which is the instrument employed by “Christendom” (Rev. 13:15), and the “man of sin”, which particularly embraces the malicious clergy and those who were once enlightened concerning the truth, and all of whom have become the opponents of God and his kingdom. All of these are now operating under the special guidance of Gog, their spiritual adviser, and who is the chief active agent of the Devil. The modern. conspiracy led by Gog is formed in express malice and is prosecuted with murderous intent; and concerning this it is written: “They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee.”—Ps. 83:3-5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Daniel was a captive Jew, an alien, and devoted to the praise of Jehovah God, and he told the truth, and his righteous course stung the others who were associated with him, and “shocked their susceptibilities”. The truth always “shocks the susceptibilities” of those indulging in crooked practices, because the truth exposes their wrongdoing. With malice, envy and coveteousness the other satraps took note of the royal favor Daniel received. By speaking the truth and pursuing a course of strict honesty and integrity Daniel would interfere with the schemes of the conspirators in enriching themselves at the expense of the public exchequer. They needed to get rid of him to pursue unhindered their wicked course. Likewise today •Jehovah’s witnesses, under commandment from Clirisf Jesus, speak the truth, and the truth stings the clergy and “the man of sin” and their allies, disturbs their nerves and “shocks their susceptibilities”. Jehovah’s witnesses, in order to be faithful to him, must, tell the truth, and it is the truth that holds up to shame, ridicule and contempt the hypocritical element in “Christendom” that assumes to represent God and his kingdom. As his name implies, Daniel stood for justice and for judgment; and even so Jehovah’s witnesses speak the truth and advocate justice and true judgment. These things not only disturb “Christendom’s” leaders and “the man of sin”, but cause such opposers of God’s kingdom to harden their hearts and to seek the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> The satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom, that is to say, they sought to find some apparently lawful means to bring about Daniel’s destruction. Exactly similar things come to pass in these wicked days. “Christendom,” and particularly tiie religious clement thereof, now seeks some apparently lawful means to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses because these witnesses’ telling the truth interferes with the wrongdoers. The clergy, and particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the “man of sin”, are the chief ones on earth that commit overt acts in the performance of their wicked conspiracy. They have gone to the political element, whom they wrongfully designate as “the higher powers . . . ordained of God”, and laid charges against Jehovah's witnesses, charging them with being lawbreakers, communists, revolutionists, and anarchists. Those malicious conspirators know that their charges are wickedly false, and this proves that their conspiracy is conceived in malice and prosecuted with extreme cruelty. Even after the worldly courts have repeatedly held that Jehovah’s witnesses are not lawbreakers, the religious clement and their immediate allies continue to cause the arrest and imprisonment of Jehovah’s witnesses. As no real fault was found in Daniel, even so none can be found in Jehovah’s witnesses in their work which would justify their arrest and imprisonment. They cannot be faithful to Jehovah God and at the same time engage in lawbreaking, such as revolution and anarchy, or otherwise willfully do injury to men. To the faithful followers of Christ Jesus the commandments are given to “love thy neighbour”, and “love worketh no ill to his neighbour”. — Horn. 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BETRAYERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">”An honest and faithful man is diligent in doing what is right without regard to the law which requires right to be done. Laws are unnecessary for righteous men. (1 Tim. 1:9) Any law that contravenes or opposes Jehovah God’s specific law is an unrighteous one, and no righteous man could obey that which is contrary to God’s law. The wicked are diligent to find some apparently lawful excuse or justification for their wrongful deeds, and for this purpose quite often unrighteous laws are enacted by the lawmaking body. Doubtless there were some among the 120 satraps who were of Hebrew stock but who were unfaithful to God, preferring to have the approval of mca and pursue their own wicked and selfish course. Such men, being acquainted with the devotion of a true Jew to Jehovah, would know about Daniel’s strict observance of God’s commandments, and they would be the very ones who would suggest to the others in the conspiracy a means by which they could “get” Daniel. “Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.” (Dan. 6:5) The betrayers of Daniel here pictured the Judas or “man of sin” class, who pretend to serve God but who in fact are God’s enemies. “These men” mentioned in the foregoing prophecy knew that Daniel observed the commandments of Jehovah: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” (Ex. 20:1-3) Knowing this, the betrayers in the conspiracy advised a course that should be taken by which they would entrap Daniel, and hence the enactment of a law of the realm directly contrary to God’s law. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are strictly endeavoring to obey God’s law, and his rule by which they are now specially guided is this: “Ye are my witnesses, . . . that I am God”; “go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem [from house to house in ‘Christendom’], and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry, for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof”; and obeying these commandments they publicly preach and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;0</span><span class="font4"> from house to house. (Isa. 43:12; Ezek. 9:4; Acts 20: 20) The faithful witnesses of Jehovah now heed the admonition of God’s Word: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,” that is, to Jehovah and to his King, to whom he has committed the authority, and not to the base, world-powers that dishonor God's name. (Rom. 13:1) Having undertaken to do the will of God, and having no desire to violate any just or righteous law, these faithful servants of the Lord say: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29) Where the law of this world contravenes God’s law the faithful must obey God’s law at any cost, and no one of the conspirators understands that fact so fully as the “evil servant” class. It would be some of that very crowd that would suggest to their coconspirators Ike enactment of a law whereby Jehovah’s witnesses might be entrapped. It was the Judas “man of sin” class that first denounced the work of Jehovah’s witnesses as a “book-selling scheme”, and doubtless they made the suggestion to the other conspirators that Jehovah’s witnesses be proceeded against as breakers of the law concerning hawkers and peddlers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1!1</sup> The suggestion made by these, men that “we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except, we find it against him concerning the law of his God”, would necessarily call for a consultation to be held by the conspirators to determine just'the course that they should take. Without a doubt this meeting was held without the knowledge of Daniel. “Then these presidents and princes assembled together to Ihe king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.” (Dan. 6: 6) The course of the wicked is the same at all times; hence we may reasonably conclude that the satraps assembled and with great manifestation of loyalty and loud words of being themselves law-abiding, and with much solemn and hypocritical speech, worked up a feeling against Daniel and patted themselves on the back as being ihe defenders of tIm kingdom. Then they would appoint probably the greatest hypocrite amongst them, who also possessed eloquence, to be the spokesman of the crowd, and these would march into the presence of the king and there proceed to induce the king to make a decree that would suit their purposes. It is even so today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>&quot; The “Ministerial Alliance” meets at regular intervals to discuss ways and means to further their own selfish ends. These, together with their “stool birds”, assemble and pretend to look up to the supreme power, offer up hypocritical prayers for the protection of their crooked allies, declare, their own allegiance to the government, and thereby hope to have the endorsement and support of the common people. They work themselves up to convince themselves that they are pursuing a great and righteous course, and hope to induce the people to back them up. In harmony therewith God’s prophet says: ‘Why do these non-Judeans thus tumultously assemble, and the people imagine a vain thing?’ (Ps. 2:1) These modern-day satraps deem it necessary that they must first impress the common people with their own devotion to the law and that they are guardians and protectors of the nation, and many of the common people are induced to believe just such vain things. The action of the conspirators both in Daniel’s day r.nd in modern times is in fact a challenge to Jehovah God for him to permit them to put their schemes into operation so as to put his witnesses to a decided test. Such a thought necessarily would originate with Satan and would be carried forward by his chief officer. These modern-day conspirators are so thoroughly impressed with their own importance that they think that Jehovah will use them to rid the land of the men and women who go about preaching to the people, and which preaching interrupts and shocks the susceptibilities of the modern conspirators. They even think to show Jehovah that his confidence in these people, who call themselves Jehovah’s witnesses, is sadly misplaced. These conspirators of modem times come to Jehovah with their mouths wide open, speaking honeyeti words, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font4">their hearts are insincere and far removed from the Lord. (2 Tim. 3:5; Ir,a. 29:13) They rely upon their “garments” as a means of deceiving the people and their being continued in the favor of God. (Ps. 59:7,8) Satan set tl.e pace for such hypocritical action when he appeared before Jehovah God with respect to Job.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The satraps approaching Darius said: “King Darius, live for ever”; but they were insincere and their hearts were not with the king. They were bent upon accomplishing their own wicked purposes. Likewise the modern-day satraps or conspirators approach Jehovah God and in substance say: “Jehovah, you are mighty, but you stay in heaven and let us run the things down here on earth. We arc looking after your interests.” Be assured the Lord knows that such men are liars and hypocrites. They use their mouths, and ‘their speech betrays them’. “With their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.” (Ezek. 33:31) This should be sufficient evidence to convince all sober-minded and thoughtful persons that such religionists are not the representatives of God, but are God’s enemies and the enemies of his kingdom. The modern-day conspirators, particularly the Homan Catholic hierarchy, well know that the truth is their greatest danger and that if the common people know the truth, these ecclesiastics will lose their power and control over the people and their opportunity to fleece the people will be done; hence they want to “get” the ones whom Daniel here foreshadowed, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, who testify to the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The first thing that those satraps did was to tell the king a lie; and the modern-day satraps do the same thing when they stand before the Lord God. They told the king that all the official element of the government had consulted together to establish a royal statute for the protection of the government. They knew that was a lie, because the chief president of the government, Daniel himself, knew nothing about it. The Devil put that thought into their mind; and the Roman Catholic hierarch}<sup>7</sup> has followed the same tactics ever since it was organized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Imagine now this company of solemn-faced hypocritical “roosters”, with long beards, well oiled, and with long flowing robes, marching solemnly into the presence of the king. Then the fat, pot-bellied spokesman standing forth in the front line and speaking that the entire crowd might hear him, saying to the king: “All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, 0 king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.”—Dan. 6: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> In order to bring all those distinguished satraps from every part of the wide-flung lledo-L’ersian empire it required much travel and communication and much expense, and all of this just to “get” one man, Daniel, whose honest administration of his office had interfered with the robbing of the public treasury and obtaining money from the people by false pretenses on the part of the 119 other satraps. They well knew they were lying when they said to the king, “All the presidents of the kingdom” had consulted together. Their purpose in leaving out Daniel’s name was to deceive the king. Likewise today the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which constitutes the earthly<sup>7 </sup>brains of the modern conspiracy, and who are aided and supported by the Protestant clergy and by the “evil servant” class, go to great efforts of time, energy and expense merely to “get” a little company of men and women, Jehovah’s witnesses, who are interfering with their selfish operations. At first they treated Jehovah’s witnesses with silent contempt, and then the truth stung them so terrifically and so terribly “shocked their susceptibilities” that they<sup>7</sup> were moved to act. Simultaneously they attempt to have a law passed in New Jersey, New York, the provinces of Canada, in England and in other places, upon the pretext that such a law is necessary to protect the people from the wicked movement known as Nazism, which now controls Germany. At the same time they well know that their real purpose is to destroy Jehovah's witnesses. In Germany<sup>7</sup> the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Nazis work hand in hand. The Nazis are engaged in an effort to kill Jehovah’s witnesses. The Roman Catholic hierarchy is engaged in the same unrighteous business. The overzealous New Jersey representative of the hierarchy<sup>7</sup> tried to slip one over on the people in New Jersey, to get a law enacted with teeth in it to prevent the speaking in any manner whatsoever of anything that might expose the crookedness of the hierarchy. He talked too much with his mouth, however, and his noisy words caused some to hear and to act and to expose the nefarious movement. It must be the due time of the Lord for this matter to come to the open, because long ago he foretold the conspiracy in his Word, when he said: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bunds asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” —Ps. 2: 2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Whenever some unusual and drastic measure is introduced in the legislative halls the claim is made that “an emergency has arisen”, hence action must be taken. The same policy was followed in Daniel’s day. The conspiring satraps declared to the king that they had all agreed that a law should be made, and which must be enforced for thirty days, because an emergency had arisen, within which time certain things must be done. They concluded that thirty days would be long enough for them to “get” Daniel or any other faithful worshiper of Jehovah. The time of an entire moon was to be set aside to spy out and gather together the necessary facts, that is, evidence, whether true or perjured, and then within that time and during some day of formal worship and practice of their Baal religion they would have Daniel duly and “legally” executed. Those conspiring satraps reasoned that, if Daniel prayed openly to Jehovah within that period of time and they could prove it, such would be a shock, not only to their own “susceptibilities”, but to the susceptibilities of the king, and that such a flagrant violation of the law would demand the immediate and public execution of Daniel. Satan seems always to have held that “religious groups” should be safeguarded from slander and libel and hence no one should be permitted to speak the truth or act any truth that would tend to call attention to the frauds and hypocritical practices of such Baal-religious groups. This really involves the great issue: Jehovah God or the Devil, who is supreme? It was tried out with Daniel, and it is tried out now, and the result is certain to be the same way, because Jehovah is at the helm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Of course, any Jew, including Daniel, could within the secrets of his own heart and in his secluded bedchamber make petition to Jehovah and be heard by Jehovah just as well as in doing so by public prayer, and, he so doing in secret, the rulers in the governments could not know about it. The same is also true of the present day. Such hidden worship by Jehovah’s witnesses might be carried on by praying to Jehovah God and talking secretly to others about his kingdom without even the hierarchy’s knowing it. But such hidden worship would be positive evidence of the fear of men, and a taeit admission that Jehovah is not supreme and cannot protect and deliver his own. That is exactly what Satan desires to accomplish. The Lord foreknew this and warns that ‘the fear of man leadeth into a snare’. (Prov. 29:25) But “the fear of the Lord tendeth to life”. (Prov. 19:23) To be a true worshiper of Almighty God one must obey his commandments, one of which is, “Ye are my witnesses”; that is to say, you must make known to others that your trust is in Jehovah and that he is the only source of life and blessings and the One to whom all proper petition can be presented with certainty of having the same answered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> To limit all prayers or petitions to the king of Persia would be making the king a god and allowing him to control the conscience of men. Such would show supremacy of a power other than Almighty God. The conspiring satraps proposed a law that would make the state the supreme power, to which all the people must yield and thus blindly obey a human dictator. It is exactly so today. Every part of the earth is in a state of turmoil. The powers that rule arc being defied by the lawless. The clergy and all religion-mongers come forth with pious faces and hypocritical words and say to the political powers, in substance, this: ‘The communistic and revolutionis-tic spirit is due to a lack of proper respect for the religious groups in the land; therefore give us a law with teeth in it, which law will not permit any person or organization to in any manner speak or publish or say or do anything that might in any manner whatsoever subject our religious groups to ridicule, scorn, or conlempt. ’ Further the religious conspirators say, ‘This is a Christian nation, and it is the Christian duty of all to be subservient to the state in order that there may be peace and prosperity in the land.’ Those words seem to be well chosen, but the speakers know they are hypocritical. They know that their claim is false and that their real purpose is to rid the land of those who faithfully serve and worship Jehovah God and speak the truth about his King and kingdom, which is the only hope of the world, as the Scriptures declare. This is further proof that the clergy and their allies, or coconspirators, are instruments of Satan. These conspirators, therefore, demand that provision be made by law that whatsoever the people may hear by radio, phonograph, transcription machines, word of mouth, printed page or other means of communication, must first be approved by a committee appointed by the state; hence no one would be permitted to say anything until it is first censored by the duly appointed groups. They proceed to make up a committee of Catholies, Protestants and Jews, who practice their own religion, each of a different kind, and none of which serve Jehovah God, and this committee attempts to tell the people what they shall or shall not hear. The evidence offered before the Congress of the United States in 1934, and before the state legislative body in New Jersey in the same year, abundantly proves that the clergy, and particular!}' the Roman Catholic hierarchy, priests, pre’hchers and other agents, have formed and are carrying out </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> conspiracy to prevent the people from worshiping Almighty God as he has commanded them. The enactment of such drastic laws which are destructive of freedom of speech and of press, so far as religion is concerned, proves beyond all doubt that the real purpose is to prevent the people from hearing the truth of and concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom. The Devil himself is back of such a movement. To be sure, that conspiracy is led by G'og, but these earthly hypocritical representatives of Gog have concluded that their quickest and most effective method of accomplishing their wieked purpose is to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and thus to stop their work in every part of “Christendom” and to thus succeed in ‘cutting them off from being a nation’. Those who really love Jehovah and have taken their stand on his side will not be disturbed by the activities of the enemy. They know that the conspirators cannot succeed in their wickedness; for the reason, it is written: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. ’ ’—Ps. 2: 4. 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The conspirators asked that the law should provide that anyone who should pray to any other than Darius should be east to the lions and by them consumed. The lions here mentioned wore the king's lions and stood for the execution of justice. The conspirators reasoned that, if they could have Daniel thrown to the lions, all the people would say: “Surely that man Daniel got what was coming to him. He must have been a bad man.” At the same time these conspirators would expect the people to sing their own praises and hold them up as defenders of the law. The modern-day conspirators have reasoned the same way and have concluded that they must find some apparently lawful means of destroying Jehovah’s witnesses and, if the laws on the statute books are insufficient to accomplish their purposes, then some new law must be passed. In line with this the conspirators said to King Darius: “Now, 0 king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the JIedes and Persians, which altereth not.” (Dan. 6:8) In keeping therewith the pope sends word along to his various active agents in the nations of “Christendom” to get a law passed that Jehovah’s witnesses might be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>* The enemy of Jehovah’s witnesses desire God’s approval to go ahead in their destructive work, and hence they seek a “lawful means” to accomplish the same. They have long held and openly advocated that the political element of the world rule by divine right and hence that if they can have a law put upon the statute books under which they might “frame” Jehovah’s witnesses they can thereby bring about their destruction and accomplish the same in apparently a lawful manner and with God’s approval. Because the action of the conspirator’s was, in Daniel’s time, and is now, a challenge to Almighty God, the King eternal, he responds to them as he did on another occasion to the Devil: “Thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.” (Job 2:3) “Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frnmeth mischief by a law?”—Ps. 94:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> The king, Darius, yielded to the request of the satraps. “Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.” (Dan. 6:9) This illustrates how Jehovah permits ‘the wieked to spring up as the gras and all the workers of iniquity tollourish’ (Ps, 92; 7), and to use so-called “legal” means or methods Io bring about the destruction of faithful witnesses of the Lord. God permits the earthly ruling factors to pursue their own way and to enact laws according to their own selfish ideas and to enforce the same, that such laws may operate as a test to his own people; but that docs not mean at all that God approves such cruel and unrmhteous laws. The great question involved is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and hence that means that his anointed ones must receive the test and continue to maintain their integrity toward God until the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFUL WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> The big powwow before King Darius was hold publicly in'the absence of Daniel, but when Daniel learned that the decree was signed he did not falter in his faithfulness and devotion to Jehovah God. “Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his window's being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.” (Dan. 6:10) The record does not say that Daniel attempted to prevent the making of the decree; but if he did know about it before it was signed he may have protested against it. Jehovah’s witnesses presented a petition to the Congress of the United States and a protest to the legislative body of New Jersey against certain laws, but they have not tried to prevent the enactment of any law against them. Their vigorous protest has been made in order that the record might be made up against the conspirators and that thus the mouths of the conspirators might be for ever slopped from saying that they did not know they were fighting against Almighty God by persecuting his witnesses. The attitude of Jehovah’s witnesses concerning all such matters is, Let the Devil and his crowd do what they will, but while they are doing it we will take occasion to tell them and the people what they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>82</sup> Daniel went into his house, and before his window that opened in the direction of Jerusalem he got down on his knees three times every day and prayed to Jehovah God. This proved that he feared not man, but that he feared Jehovah. Thus he pictured the remnant now on earth with their hearts and faces turned toward Jehovah’s organization, his kingdom, and showing that their chief purpose is to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. The remnant will remain true to Jehovah and his kingdom, regardless of consequences that might come upon them at the hands of the enemy. Like the faithful ones of olden times, the faithful remnant now say concerning Jehovah and his organization: “Jf I forget thee, 0 Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.” (Ps. 137: 5, 6) “Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud; and he shall hear my voice.” (Ps. 55:17) Regardless of the opposition of the conspirators and the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses the faithful remnant will continue to worship Almighty God as he has commanded them, in the same way that Jesus and his faithful apostles did aforetime, to wit, by ‘publicly going from house to house and preaching the gospel’.—Acts 20:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>S3</sup> Had Daniel gone to the king and asked for a permit or a license to pray to Jehovah, that would have been conforming to the decree of the king, because he must first get the consent of the king before he could pray, and that would be showing that he did not sincerely hold that Jehovah is supreme and above the king on earth, which course of action would have been an insult to Jehovah. The state or earthly government is not a mediator between God and men. Jehovah is above all, and his law is supreme and his people will obey it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> The divine rule is not subject to change. Jehovah has commanded his anointed to go and bear testimony to the people by telling them the truth that Jehovah is* God and that Satan’s organization is the enemy of God and shall soon be destroyed. This truth of God’s Word necessarily subjects the practitioners of modern religion to shame, ridicule and contempt in the eyes of honest men and women, and calls forth the denunciation of the religionists and their efforts to destroy the witnesses; but this must not deter the remnant nor cause them to slack their hand in the performance of what God has commanded them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The conspirators posted men at vantage points •where the evidence they needed might be procured. Likewise today the conspirators against Jehovah’s witnesses post members of their strong-arm squad and those of the Judas class where they can obtain evidence against Jehovah's witnesses. A company of these forming a part of the Judas class camp near the Bethel home in order that they may spy out what goes on and misrepresent the facts, hoping thereby to entrap those who are serving Jehovah God. If the evidence at hand is not strong enough those “staked out” witnesses make it stronger to suit their own desires. This was foreshadowed by what the&quot; crooked satraps did concerning Danigl: “Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying [making petition] and making supplication before his God.” (Dan. 6:11) The real purpose of the conspirators was, not to stop Daniel’s worship of Jehovah, but to find some apparently lawful excuse to destroy Daniel. Likewise the modern-day conspirators move against Jehovah’s witnesses, not merely because they arc worshiping Almighty God, but for the reason they hope to find some apparently lawful excuse to destroy those witnesses who testify to God’s truth, which truth exposes the Devil worshipers to ridicule and contempt. As it was with Daniel, so it is with Jehovah’s witnesses. Daniel, by disregarding the unrighteous law of that realm, would bring upon him death, but unfaithfulness to Jehovah God would bring upon him destruction. Even so today, Jehovah’s witnesses, by disregarding some law of the land, may be subjected to death, but their disregarding of or disobedience to Jehovah’s law means the complete destruction of their very existence, as Jesus declared: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10:28) Those faithful unto Jehovah obey his law, and trust him implicitly as to the result. The faithful fear neither man nor Devil, but they do make Jehovah God their fear; as it is written: “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary.” (Isa. 8:13,14) To obey Jehovah’s law the faithful anointed cannot hide themselves by declining to openly testify to his name, nor can they have an excuse to sit quietly in their homes and hum hymns and read books. The true and faithful are Jehovah’s witnesses, and they must not cease to bear the fruits of the kingdom Ixi-fore men and to pray for the increase of Jehovah’s kingdom interests and for the destruction of Satan’s rule. In the faithful performance of their divinely given commission the remnant know that they are putting themselves in a position of jeopardy at the hands of men; but they are blind to everything save that of rendering full obedience unto Jehovah God. —Isa. 42:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> The divine record supports the conclusion that Daniel was not present before the king when the conspirators appeared to make accusation against him. He was tried in his absence. It is even so at the present time. Often the case is made up, and the decision determined upon, before the defendants, Jehovah's witnesses, are even arrested. Seeing Daniel down on his knees praying, the satraps chuckled to themselves and went straightway before the king. “Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; lltast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, 0 king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.” (Dan. 6:12) The conspirators wished to get the absolute confirmation from the king’s lips that the decree had been signed making death the penalty for any man’s asking a petition of any god or man other than the king within thirty days. They put a hypotlietical case before the king, being careful to hold back the name of Daniel until they received the desired answer. The answer of the king was in the affirmative, that they had properly staled the decree as signed, and that such law was unchangeable. The conclusion of the conspirators then was that they had an open and shut case against Daniel the Jew and that now they would soon make lion food of him. In modern times, when it seems needful to accomplish something that is unusual the ruling powers declare that a &quot;state emergency” exists and that for the safety and peace of the people of the nations drastic laws must be made and executed. Based upon that hypocritical excuse the Hitler government did without reason or just eau.se issue a decree prohibiting Jehovah’s witnesses from preaching the gospel of the kingdom and from serving Jehovah God within that realm. In other parts of ‘•Christendom” Satan’s crowd, under the leadership of Gog, is doing the same thing. Such was foreshadowed by the thirty-day period fixed by the law of the king as an ‘‘emergency period”. The enemies of God seize upon like man-made period of “emergency” to find some lawful excuse by which Jehovah’s witnesses may be destroyed. Thus the satraps put 1 he matter before the king in order to bring about the death of Daniel. It is even so today, that the leaders of “Christendom” hide behind what they call a “state emergency” and emergency laws as a cover for their wicked action in bringing about the persecution and destruction of Jehovah's witnesses and the preventing of the declaration of the message of God’s kingdom. Daniel at this stage of the prophetic picture appeared to be in grave danger of immediate destruction. The king had unwittingly committed himself by his declaration of the law, and from this he could not now withdraw. Likewise in the present time Jehovah’s witnesses and their work in every part of “Christendom” apparently stand in grave danger of immediate destruction. What will the faithful do now? and why, some will ask and do ask, does Jehovah permit his anointed to be placed in such a position of immediate danger?</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CHIEF ONE OF TOE NEW CREATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH GOD ended his creative work with respect to the earth on the seventh “day” or creative period. The record of the book of Genesis (2:2,3) says: “And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.” Without doubt this statement relates to the creative work of Jehovah so far as the same pertains to things earthly. God is never idle. Long after the creation of man Jesus Christ said: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”—John 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man was the climax of the work of God as God’s creation related to things earthly; which work was perfect. (Dcut. 32:4) Thereafter Jesus came to the earth; and it may be asked, Was not he the creative work of Jehovah as that work related to the things </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the earth? No; he was not. He was the second perfect man on the earth, but he was not created as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Adam </span><span class="font4">was created. His life, or existence, together with the right thereto, was transferred from heaven to earth. He was begotten in the womb of Mary by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">power of Jehovah, even as the prophet Isaiah had foretold that a virgin should conceive and bring forth a son. (Isa. 7:14) He was not. there created, but he was the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:16) The Scriptures frequently speak of him as God’s only begotten Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many make the mistake of thinking that God is responsible for the birth of every child. God delegat</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font4">to the first man Adam the power and authority to transmit life; and when Adam was sentenced to death because of sin the right to life was taken from him and he could not transmit the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font4"> to existence </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">life, but he did transmit life to a limited degree. Jesus was born in a manner similar to that of other children: but his birth was perfect, because his exist</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ence </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">right thereto emanated directly from Jehovah. In 1 Corinthians 15: 47 it is written: “The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">first </span><span class="font4">man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since all the human raec sprang from Adam and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font4">begotten or born after his sin, all were born sinners. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all other men of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">were under this same disability. The exception to this rule was Jesus; and he was perfect, for the reason that he was not begotten by man, as above </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">stated. </span><span class="font4">It therefore is clear that when he had created Adam, Jehovah rested from his creative work relative </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font4">earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font4">the time that Abraham offered his son Isaac as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">sacrifice in the mountain called Moriah God said to him: “Tn thy seed shall all the nations of the earth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">blessed.” (Gen. 22:18) Any blessing of mankind </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">would be of lasting value must include an opportunity for man to gain everlasting life. The son </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Abraham being imperfect, it is manifest that, the promised blessing could not come through him. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fact </span><span class="font4">that Isaac died and that the blessing did not come in his day is of itself proof that, Isaac was not the real One indicated by the promise. Long afterward it was written (Gal. 3:3,16): “And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For centuries the ‘seed of promise’ through which the blessing must come to the peoples of earth was shrouded in mystery. God ordained it so. That mystery began to be made known at Pentecost, the fiftieth day after Jesus was raised from the dead, end was then made known only to those who were consecrated and faithfully devoted to the Lord God. (Col. 1:26; Eph. 3:4,9) That ‘seed of promise’, which is the mystery of Christ, is the new creation, and constitutes the agency employed and to be employed by Jehovah in carrying out his purpose to vindicate his holy name and to bless all the families of the earth as promised. The blessing of the families or peoples of the earth moans that God will give them opport unity to live, and such opportunity must come in his appointed way, to wit, by and through the promised .seed, which is Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new creation is The Christ. The Christ is a composite body made up of many members. The Head of The Christ is Jesus Christ, God's beloved Son. Those who are taken from amongst men, and justified, begotten and anointed by the spirit of Jehovah, and who then continue faithful unto death, will constitute the members of The Christ complete. (Eph. 1: 22, 23) In Colossians 1:18,19 it is stated: “And he | Jesus] is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father’ that in him should all fulness dwell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new creation while on earth is a real thing, not an imaginary or “reckoned” thing. It does not consist of all who claim to be Christian, but consists of only those who by adoption into Jehovah's royal family become part of the ‘seed of promise’ as members of the body of Christ.' It is written (2 Cor. 5: 17): “If any man bo in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things arc become new. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The human body is taken as an illustration of The Christ, the Head and the members of the bod}’ being referred to as one. The apostle Paul writes: “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. For the body is not one member, but many.” (1 Cor. 12:12,14) “The Christ” and “the new creation” therefore mean one and the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Christ” means the Anointed One of God. The pouring of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron the first Jewish high priest symbolically said: ‘This one is anointed and is set aside to serve the Lord God in the priest’s office to which he is appointed.’ This foreshadowed the anointing of Christ Jesus. God did the anointing; therefore Christ Jesus is The Christ of God, appointed, anointed and installed in the office of High Priest for the service of Jehovah. (1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 1:17) As the scripture (Ileb. 1:8,9; Ps. 45:6,7) states: “But unto the Son [Jesus] he saith, Thy throne, 0 God [mighty one, or ruler], is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God [Jehovah], even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus is the ‘seed of promise’, or “seed of Abraham”, the official channel through which the blessings of all the nations of the earth must come. (Gal. 3:27-29; 4:28; Ileb. 6:17; 2 Pet. 3:13) The seed must first come, and through the seed the blessing would come. That declared purpose of Jehovah, which is called the Abrahamie covenant, is the only covenant jiertaining to the blessing of the people, and that covenant is not made with any creature. It is the unconditional promise of Jehovah, made doubly sure and binding by his word and oath. Jehovah also saw the necessity for a covenant, “the new covenant,” to take out a people for his name. (Acts 15:14) Jehovah gave his word of promise that he would bless mankind after the taking out of this people for his name and the setting up of his kingdom, and that blessing must eome through his chosen seed, Christ Jesus. That being his expressed purpose, Jehovah will perform his purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy of the denominational systems have taught the people that the only place of salvation is in heaven, that no one can be saved unless he joins himself unto some denominational church system, and that then when he dies he will go to heaven. They have made the people believe that God has been putting forth a strenuous effort to get men into heaven. Satan the deceiver has been responsible for this scheme advocated by the preachers. Uis purpose has been to turn the minds of the people away from God and to blind them concerning God’s provision for their salvation and blessing. Up to this time Satan has well succeeded in blinding mankind; but now the change is at hand, because it is God’s due time to let the people know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems clear that the time is at hand when the people may understand that the mystery hid from ages and generations is The Christ, through which their blessings must come. Christ is God's way for man to obtain life. Life is a gift from God through Christ Jesus. (John 14:6; Rom. 5:18; 6:23) The people must have some knowledge before they can accept God’s gracious gift. In due time God will bring all men to an accurate knowledge of the truth, and that time seems now at hand. (Isa. 11:9) Men may take courage now and study God’s purpose with a hope of finding the way that leads to everlasting life and blessings. This is true, not because men are any wiser today, but because it is the due time of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The perfect man Jesus consecrated himself unto God. Consecration meant his agreement to do the will of God. He said: “I come ... to do thy will, O my God.” (Ps. 40:7,8; Heb. 10:7) This he did when he presented himself at the Jordan river and was baptized by John the Immerser. His baptism was a picture, symbolically testifying of his death as a man in order to be the Redeemer of men. (Rom. 6:3,4) From the time of his birth as a babe until the moment of his baptism he was a human creature, nothing more and nothing less. He was perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of his baptism Jesus was begotten by Jehovah and acknowledged as his beloved Son. After his temptation in the wilderness he was anointed with the spirit of God. (Matt. 3:13-4:11) There he became Jesus Christ, the anointed One of God. As it is written: “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power.” (Acts 10: 38) There the new creation began; and there Christ Jesus was made the Head over the members of the new creation, which is his body. (Col. 1:18) His anointing carried with it a commission from Jehovah God to do a specific work. (Isa. 61:1,2) After Jesus was thus anointed he understood what his relationship was to Jehovah and the work that he had to do. —Luke 4:16-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of anointing of Jesus he was appointed and installed in the office of Priest unto Jehovah God. He was and is a Priest “after the order of Meh-hiz-edek”. (Ileb. 5: 3-6; Ps. 110: 4) As a man he sprang from the tribe of Judah, and there was no provision made by Jehovah God for a priesthood to be taken from that tribe. It was as a new creature that Jesus was a Priest of the similitude of Melehizedek the king of ancient Salem and the priest of the Most High God. (Heb. 7:1-22) As such Priest Jesus was, and is for ever, the honored Servant and Executive Officer of Jehovah God. As a great High Priest he offered himself as a human sacrifice to provide (and he did provide) the ransom price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus died upon the tree on Calvary and thereby gave himself a ransom for all mankind. (1 Tim. 2:5,6; Heb. 2:9) He was put to death in the flesh and was raised from the dead in the spirit. (1 Pet. 3:18) He was the first one that was raised from the dead to perfection of life. (1 Cor. 15:1-20) He was given immortality at that time, even as Jehovah God had promised; and while he died as a man, he was raised as divine from the dead, and is now alive for evermore.—John 5:26; Rev. 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because Christ Jesus was God’s anointed Priest to minister in the office to which he was appointed, he said: “I can of mine own self do nothing: . . . because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” (John 5:30) From the time that he was anointed all work and judgment concerning the execution of the divine purpose with reference to the vindication of his Father’s name and the salvation of men was committed to him. (John 5:22) When he said, “I can of mine own self do nothing,” that did not mean that he was coerced into obedience by Jehovah; but it did mean that his devotion to his Father was so absolute and complete that he would and could do nothing except in harmony with his Father’s will.</span></p>
