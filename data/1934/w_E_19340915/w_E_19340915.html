The transcription machine has increased the power of Jehovah’s witnesses afield to preach Ilia truth manyfold, so that the desire for the literature is stimulated and study classes of niany interested hearers are being formed. Besides more than GOO sum machines in the United States alone, great numbers are now being eCee.tively used in countries near and afar. For more information, write the Society.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>WICKED SPIRITS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.’’—Eph. 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S great name having been reproached both by angels and by men, he sent Jesus to earth for the purpose of vindicating his name and to bear witness to the truth. In doing this Jesus must preach ami did preach both by word of mouth and by his consistent course of action. Whatsoever preaching Jesus did, that preaching was done in the performance of his commission. The apostle Peter under inspiration wrote: “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to Clod, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit: by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.’’—1 Pct. 3: 18-20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Having now learned that the primary purpose of Jehovah in sending Jesus to earth, and the primary purpose of the work of Jesus, is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the remnant may now expect to obtain through Christ Jesus at the temple a clear understanding of the words of the apostle concerning the “spirits in prison’’. Who are those spirits in prison? Who imprisoned them? and in what manner did Jesus preach to them? According to the Scriptures those “spirits in prison’’ were prior to the flood the ones designated in Genesis six as the “sons of God’’, and their wrongdoing consisted in their leaving their assigned duties in God’s organization and marrying the daughters of men and thus devoting themselves to that which was in disobedience to God’s law concerning them. The Scriptures do not say that their disobedience extended over the entire 600 years that Noah lived. Probably they were disobedient during all that time and the preaching of righteous Noah brought home to them notice that they were doing wrong. It is the wickedness of man that is emphasized by the Scriptural record. (Gen. 6:5) It was then that God declared that “yet his [man’s] days shall be an hundred and twenty years”. It was during the latter part of these 120 years that Jehovah gave Noah instruction concerning the ark, because at that time of receiving such instruction Noah had sons and his sons were married. The disobedience of the sons of God continued during that period of time. This is definitely fixed by 1 Peter 3: 20, above quoted: ‘Which sometime [aforetime, If.P.] were disobedient, when the ark was being prepared.’ When the ark was completed and the Hood came, there the “old world” ended. That means the change in spirit conditions as well as earthly conditions; hence at that time apply the words of the apostle, to wit: “The world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.” (2 Pet. 3:6) It was at that time that the spirits were imprisoned, and which shows that they were not destroyed. It was to those imprisoned spirits that Jesus preached. Noah, “a preacher of righteousness,” preached to them prior to the flood and they had not heeded his preaching, and for that reason they did not escape imprisonment. Those spirits could not have been killed at that time, because they were alive in Jesus’ day; otherwise Jesus could not have preached to them. It is quite certain that those disobedient spirits, “the sons of God,” are still alive, but under restraint or imprisoned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Who imprisoned them? There is no reason to conclude that God imprisoned them. Since they were disobedient to God, would he not be the one to imprison them? Not necessarily so. There is no evidence in the Scriptures that God did imprison them. Those angels once in God’s organization and in his service had fallen to the wiles of the Devil, and God would deliver such up to his enemy Satan and permit the enemy Satan to imprison them. Such is the course followed by Jehovah under like circumstances. This is supported by the faet that the Israelites were once in the organization and service of Jehovah, and that they fell away to the wily influence of the Devil, and God gave them over to his enemy and their enemy, Satan, and permitted many of them to be held in captivity and in prison. (Iios. 11:8; Jer. 12: 7; Isa. 47:6) Also those who go to make up the “great multitude” class were begotten of the spirit, being brought forth as the sons of God, and had opportunity to devote themselves wholly to God’s service and had an invitation to run tor the prize of the kingdom, and yet they have fallen to the wily influence of the Devil and his allies, have attempted to serve God and the Devil’s organization at the same time, have fallen into Satan's trap, and are held in Satan’s organization or prison house, and are designated as “prisoners”. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">.1926, page 339.) The disobedient “sons of God” in the days of Noah likewise did not heed the preaching of Noah, and when the flood came they found there was no protection for them regardless of whether or not they desired to ref urn to God's organization at that time. They had been disobedient and walked into Satan’s trap. Had God imprisoned those disobedient spirits the manifest purpose would have been to restrain them from further disobedience, and this supports the conclusion that God did not restrain them. If Satan is the one who put them in prison his purpose would be to Keep them under his control and thus prevent them from returning to God, just as he holds now the. “great multitude” in prison. After the flood came, and which taught these disobedient spirits the supreme power of Jehovah, and showed the vindication of his word and his name, such spirit creatures would be restrained by Satan and his wicked allies to prevent them from breaking away. Babylon is the name of Satan’s organization; and as God’s once chosen people, the Israelites, were held in Babylon, it is evidently in Babylon, that is to say, the Devil’s invisible organization, where the disobedient spirits are held in prison and which, in the Scriptures, is called “the land of Magog”.—Ezek. 38:2; 39:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Since those “sons of God” who became disobedient in Noah’s day did not take advantage of God’s long-suffering during the 120 years, and did not hearken unto the preaching of righteous Noah, God’s representative and witness, Jehovah would let them go and would give them no protection and did give them no protection in the flood. This finds a strong parallel at the present time, as will hereinafter be seen. Their disobedience in disregarding God’s organization and his service would separate them from Jehovah, and their fear would bring them into Satan’s snare, just as fear brings the “tribulation” company into the snare of Satan. (Prov. 29:25) Thus Satan and his nephilim bullies would hold these “sons of God” in restraint or in prison, not permitting them again to return to the Lord Jehovah and his service. When the “sons of God”, in harmony with Jehovah’s will, came to present themselves and Satan would come also in their midst there to show off himself, those whom Satan had restrained would not appear. (Job 2:1) The disobedient “sons” of Noah's day would not be there, but would be held in restraint, even as Satan and his agents now hold the “great multitude” in restraint and away from the assembly of God’s witnesses, and this Satan does by using the clergy to restrain them. But as the message of truth now preached by the consistent lives of the faithful witnesses, as well as by radio and in printed form, reaches the “prisoners”, the “great multitude”, even so God has arranged that the message of truth shall reach the spirit prisoners held by Satan, that they in due time might seek him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">To those disobedient spirits Jesus preached, as stated by the apostle Peter. Since the purpose of preaching is reformation, if possible, of those who hear, that must have been the purpose of Jesus in preaching to them. (Rom. 10:14, 15) By maintaining his integrity toward God under the most trying conditions, even suffering an ignominious death, Jesus preached a powerful sermon to all who observed. Then being raised up out of death by the power of Jehovah and given the most exalted place in God’s organization, and that because of his faithfulness to God, would be a most powerful witness to those spirits hold in prison and who were there because they had failed to be faithful to God and remain in his organization. The fact that it is stated that Jesus did preach Io them strongly supports the conclusion that they v ill have an opportunity to be recovered in God's due time. If that is the correct conclusion, then they will have to take a positive stand against Satan and Gog and then at the cost of great suffering firmly show thei.i allegiance to Jehovah and his organization. If those prisoners arc now held by Satan they are not necessarily the ‘seed of Satan’ any more than the “great multitude” constitutes a part of the seed of the wicked one. They followed their own course of reasoning, disregarded the word of God, and fell into a trap, ju&gt;t as the “great multitude” has done.—Ps. 107:9-13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>0</sup> How did Jesus preach to those spirits in prison? Not necessarily by word of mouth, but by his consistent conduct and unyielding devotion to Jehovah under the most severe test. The words of the apostle just preceding his statement concerning Jesus’ preaching to the spirits throws light upon the matter under consideration. Peter was there stating Io the Chiis-tians bow they were once going astray, and how they were brought back to the Lord Jesus Christ. Then lie says: “In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives; beholding your chaste bchaxior coupled with fear. As Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose, children ye now are, if ye do w ell, and are not put in fear bv anv terror.”—1 Pet. 3:1, 2, 6, A.Zf.P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> The argument of the apostle is that one professing to follow Christ Jesus must also follow a course of action in conformity to his profession, that observers may note the consistent action in the deportment and the testimony delivered by word of mouth. Mere behavior or conduct, hov.-ever, such as is called “character development”, without testimony by word of mouth will not glorify God. but there must be both an oral testimony and a consistent course of action on the part of the professed Christian. Says the apostle: “Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord” because he was God’s chosen servant. She was not honoring the man, but she was honoring the servant of God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Noah by building the ark showed to observers his faith in God and his devotion to Jehovah. His words and his course of action were consistent. Continuing, says the apostle: “But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear.”—1 Pet. 3:15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.H.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">• Such a question could not be propounded unless the verbal testimony is given causing men to ask questions, and this shows that one must preaeh both by word of mouth and by the course of action to those with whom he comes in contact. A good conscience is kept by so doing, regardless of being misunderstood by others. Hence the apostle adds: “Having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.” (1 Pet. 3:1G, zi.Zf.F.) Jehovah’s witnesses must go contrary to the world, showing forth the praises of Jehovah, and thus doing they are looked upon and called evildoers. They must be preachers by word of mouth and by their consistent course of action. The proof comes to others that they are not evildoers when God takes occasion to prove to false accusers that (hose whom they have accused have been and are his faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Then the apostle's argument shows that the faithful servants of God will be brought into conditions causing suffering, and that such is the will of God in order to afford an opportunity for them to maintain their integrity toward him. God does not send the suffering, but the faithful ones, suffering for righteousness and for doing right, prove their integrity. Therefore says the apostle: “For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.” (1 Pet. 3:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.H.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Likewise did Christ Jesus suffer, the just for the unjust. “Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.” (1 Pet. 3; 18, A./f.V.) Suffering was not required of Christ Jesus in order to provide the ransom price. Christ Jesus in maintaining his integrity toward God suffered injustice to be heaped upon him. lie suffered and remained faithful to God, and thus proved himself entirely faithful; and because of his faithfulness Jehovah raised him up out of death and exalted him to the highest place in his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> At the time of his consecration at the Jordan Jesus was counted as dead, and there began his quickening in the spirit. For three and one-half years lie was preaching the truth by word of mouth and by his consistent and constant devotion to Jehovah God. Likewise the followers of Jesus are quickened of the spirit to become preachers of God’s Word. (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 4:9) Jesus, always in Jehovah’s organization and in his favor, refused to yield to the temptations presented to him by Satan, and amidst all the persecutions that were heaped upon him by Satan he remained faithful and true to Jehovah. This, together ■with his continued course of consistent action unto death, and his being raised out of death, was the manner in which he preached to the spirits in prison, as is stated by Peter: “In which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison.” (1 Pet. 3:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.H.V.)</span><span class="font3"> These imprisoned spirits found themselves there because they had failed to be faithful in their service to God while in his organization, and now they saw the result that comes for unfaithfulness and also the result to those who arc faithful. The preaching of Jesus, therefore, was the delivering of a message in a roundabout or indirect way. He was sent to preach by word of mouth to the Jews, which he did. (Matt. 15:24) Uis preaching to the spirits was by their observing his faithful devotion and consistent holding to God’s organization, which would in effect say to them: ‘If you had remained true and faithful to God’s organization where he placed you, al this present time you would not be in prison and away from God’s favor.’ In this manner Jesus would preach to the spirits in prison, just as the behavior or conduct of the women whom Peter admonishes in this connection, and which Peter uses to illustrate the point of his argument. The conduct of Jesus preached in favor of God’s side of the great controversy and against the side of Satan, that wicked one who had entrapped these disobedient spirits. The resurrection of Jesus and his exaltation because of his faithfulnc :s to God added great strength to that preaching. Satan, knowing this, desperately put forth every effort in hi.; power to prevent the resurrection of Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Many have insisted that Jesus went somewhere and preached to the spirits in prison, because both th? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American ItcvisedVcrsion</span><span class="font3"> say that he “went” and preached to the spirits. It is entirely consistent with the foregoing explanation of his preaching by his faithful course of action, and also in complete harmony with all other scriptures, for us to conclude that Jesus did go somewhere and preach to the spirits in prison. During the three days that Jesus was dead, to be sure, he did not go anywhere. After his resurrection to life as a spirit creature divine, and between that time and the time of his ascension into heaven, a period of forty days elapsed. Within that period of time he appeared in a human organism several times to his brethren, but these appearances were only for a few minutes on each occasion. The Scriptures are silent as to where Jesus was during the other part of that forty days. There appears from the prophecy of Ezekiel that the “laml of Magog” is the place where the angels who sinned in Noah’s day are imprisoned. Since it appears that they wore imprisoned by Satan, this supports the conclusion that they arc in the “land of Magog”. (Ezek. 38:1, 2; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 311) When Jesus was resurrected he was a spirit divine, clothed with all power and authority and ability to go and come at will. There seems to be no reason why he might not have gone to the &quot;land of Magog” and there addressed a message directly to the spirit creatures restrained in prison that had sinned in Noah’s day, and which spirits have since been held in prison by the Devil. We know that the Lord has provided means whereby the &quot;great multitude” &quot;prisoners” now on earth have the gospel preached to them by radio at the present time. Why could not Jesus have preached to the spirits in prison by something similar to our radio in his time or speak to them directly? He certainly had the power to do whatsoever he might choose to do in harmony with the will of God. He was certainly able to go, and there was surely ample time for him to do so between the time of his resurrection and his ascension into heaven. (Matt. 28:18; Acts 1: 3, 4) Certainly these imprisoned spirits must be reminded that because they were once in God’s organization and left it they had fallen into Satan’s hands and been imprisoned, that Jesus, by remaining faithful and true to Jehovah and resisting the Devil’s wiles, even unto an ignominious death, had been raised from death and exalted to the highest position, and that if these spirits in prison had remained faithful they would have been entirely at liberty. What Jesus told them in words, we do. not know, but we do know that his course of action fully supports the conclusion that he might have used words similar to those above.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Peter did not say that Jesus preached deliverance to the imprisoned spirits; but according to the commission of our Lord his preaching to them, even indirectly, would imply that there is hope for the deliverance of the imprisoned spirits who in the day of judgment boldly take their stand on the side of Jehovah, even as there is hope for the &quot;great multitude” to receive deliverance at that time. What Jehovah has in store for these &quot;sons of God” who became disobedient, the Scriptures do not reveal, but if at Armageddon any of them do take a positive and unequivocal stand on the side of Jehovah and gladly leave it to Jehovah where to place them, they may be recovered and return to some place in his organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FINAL JUDGMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> The judgment entered long ago against Satan is final, and that judgment is that he shall in God’s due time be completely destroyed, and &quot;never shalt thou be any more”. (Ezek. 28:19) Satan is willfully and maliciously wicked, and those angels or spirit creatures who joined him in the rebellion are likewise willfully and maliciously wicked, and the same everlasting destruction is reserved for them. (Matt. 25:41) &quot;The wicked shall perish.” (Ps. 37:20) It is concerning those wicked angels of Satan that the apostle wrote: &quot;Whose judgment of old [now from of old, A.R.V.], does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.” (2 Pet. 2:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> Why does not judgment linger now, and their destruction wait? Because, as shown by the context, the apostle is directing his speech as applicable to the time of the end of the world, where we now are. (2 Pct. 3:7) The execution of this final judgment must take place now within a short time, because the end of the world has been reached and the warning is now given to Go’d’s people, that they may keep themselves close to Jehovah’s organization and hence in his love. At Armageddon this execution shall take place.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SENTENCED TO DEATH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The apostle Peter, in his second epistle, the second chapter thereof, emphasizes the future of all the willfully wicked, and in this connection says: &quot;For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but having confined them in Tartarus with chains of thick darkness, delivered them over into custody for judgment.” (2 Pet. 2:4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> When were these wicked angels here mentioned sentenced? The context shows that it was preceding the time of the flood, because their judgment was &quot;of old” but now does not linger. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> says: ‘They were cast down to hell’; but the word translated &quot;hell” is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">turtarus.</span><span class="font3"> The phrase &quot;having confined them in Tartarus”, according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dwglott,</span><span class="font3"> is just one word in the Greek. According to the Greek mind the word pictures a deep abyss and signifies a great abasement or degradation, being reduced to a degraded state far deeper than that to the dust from which man was made and from which he is raised out of death. It is the same abasement or degradation to which Lucifer was reduced. The &quot;angels that sinned” committed that great sin long before Noah’s day; and this is proved by the foregoing statement of Peter, and further shows that his statement docs not refer to the &quot;sons of God” who married the daughters of men in Noah’s day. Those wicked spirit creatures were a part of Lucifer's official organization, who joined him in the rebellion and were sentenced at the same time Satan was sentenced,-and until the time of their execution they arc ‘confined in chains of darkness’. That docs not mean literal chains such as we see with our eyes, but &quot;chains of thick darkness”, that is, restraint in darkness similar to that stale in which the &quot;man of sin”, &quot;the son of perdition,” is found, having lost the light concerning God’s purpose. This means utter darkness as to their understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. The holy angels have desired to look into these things, and now having come to the temple with Christ Jesus they are enlightened and permitted to look into them. (1 Pet. 1:12: Matt. 25:31) Not so, however, with the wicked angels. They are in the dark so far as God’s favor and his purposes are concerned. They are degraded and abased Io the lowest degree. There is no light of God’s favor for them. Like the unfaithful wedding guests, they are east &quot;into outer darkness”. (Matt. 22:13) In the light of God’s face is life; hence &quot;chains of thick darkness” would clearly imply eventual destruction. This text, therefore, could not refer to the confining in dark rooms of spirit mediums who operate there. Mediums’ operating in dark rooms is merely a means employed to deceive. It must be borne in mind that these wicked angels were once a part of God’s organization under Lueifer, and when Lucifer became God’s enemy they likewise became God’s enemies, and He degraded them into darkness. Such seems to be the rule that the Lord applies to all of those who are once enlightened and willfully become wicked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> Speaking of those onec in line for the kingdom, Jesus said he would send forth his angels and gather out all those ‘that offend and do iniquity’ and “shall cast them into a furnace of fire’’. (Matt. 13:41, 42; Matt. 7:23) “And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:30) The Devil himself is the chief one or chief prince of this degraded host. There arc other princes operating under him. (Dan. 10:13, 20) All of these are designated by the Scriptures as “principalities”, “powers,” ‘rulers of darkness,’ a host of ‘wicked ones in unseen places’.—Eph. 6:12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">’’Further say the Scriptures: “God . . . delivered them over into custody.” Jehovah did not need to wait until the flood before first delivering them over into chains of darkness or into custody, but this he would do at the time they became ‘the seed of the Serpent’, which was at the time they joined that old Serpent, Satan the Devil, in his rebellion against God. In the day of execution of the judgment of these wicked ones they will be cut off just as Satan will be cut off. “The Lord knows how to rescue the pious out of trial, and to keep the unrighteous for a day of judgment to be cut off.” (2 Pet. 2:9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> Putting them into “custody” would mean that these wicked ones arc constantly under surveillance of the holy angels acting under the direction of the Lord, which surveillance, however, would not prevent the wicked ones from associating with and operating with Satan in heaven, where they were at the time when Satan was cast out of heaven by the Lord. At that same time these angels were cast down to the earth with Satan. (Rev. 12:9) They operate with Satan in his organization now to bring woe upon the world, and this they are doing.—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It goes without saying that the wicked angels with Satan were not killed when they were sentenced. They are yet very much alive. Without doubt Jehovah has reserved them alive under restraint of darkness and under surveillance in order to show’ his power over them at Armageddon and thereby to convince all creation that Jehovah is God the Almighty One. (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Leaser)</span><span class="font3"> The Lord Jesus declares that these wicked ones who arc Satan’s angels shall be cut off at the same time the Devil will be cut off.—Matt. 25: 41, 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jude fully sustains the above conclusion. “And those angels who kept not their own principality, but left their own habitation, he has kept in perpetual chains, under thick darkness, for the judgment of the great day.” (Jude 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> Originally they were a part of Lucifer’s organization, and therefore “their own principality” was the place where Jehovah had assigned them in his organization under Lucifer. The statement “loft their own habitation” does not mean that they forsook the spiritual realm and became human creatures, because they did not give up their spirit bodies but still have them, although at times they may clothe themselves with human organism or bodies. This they must have done when they appeared as nephilim or giants in the earth. This they no doubt did for the very purpose of entrapping the “sons of God” who married Ihe daughters of men in Noah’s day. Their “own habitation” means the place to which they were originally assigned in Jehovah’s organization and which they left when they joined Satan in the rebellion. Those wicked ones, says Jude, God “has kept in perpetual chains, under thick darkness, for the judgment of the great day”, which means the great day of God Almighty, the battle of Armageddon. (Rev, 16: 14) In order for those wicked spirits to be brought to final judgment at “the great day” they must be alive; and hence they are alive. This does not mean that, there is any hope for them, any more than there is hope for Satan, but that it is the day of their execution under the terms of the- judgment long ago written against them and which execution will be an exhibition of Jehovah’s power and a vindication of his name. Concerning that great day of execution it is written: “And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army; for his camp is very great: for he is strong that exe-cuteth his word: for the day of tire Lord is great ami very terrible; and who can abide it?” (Joel 2:11) “The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.” (Zeph. 1:14) By his prophet Jehovah further says concerning that time of execution: “Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s [the remnant’s] trouble; but he [the faithful remnant] shall be saved out of it.”—Jer. 30: 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Before the day of their execution Jehovah informs Satan and his wicked angels that they are to be executed, and he uses his witnesses now on the earth, the faithful remnant taken out for his name’s sake, to give that testimony. This witness or testimony began particularly in 1928, when the Lord’s angel began the pouring out of his “vial” upon the air, and from which time forward there went forth the declaration against Satan and his organization and in favor of Jehovah and his organization. (See Revelation 16:17; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 57; Ezekiel 38:3-16; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 311.) This is a fitting time for Jehovah to make his faithful witnesses the remnant a “spectacle” or “theatre” both for men and for angels. (1 Cor. 4: 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> Their testimony by word of mouth and by faithfulness to God and his organization under the most severe test is a true demonstration of Jehovah’s purpose to preserve the faithful and to destroy the wicked.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> It is those wicked spirits, together with Satan, who with the killing of Abel began their murderous assaults upon those who serve God, and ever since then they have sought to destroy the servants of the Most High; and they would succeed in their murderous attacks except for the fact that Jehovah throws around his own faithful ones all needed protection. It is that same wicked crowd under Satan that constantly assaults Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. These wicked ones are led by Gog, the chief executive officer of Satan’s organization. To Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, the remnant, is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, that is to say, the testimony to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name and to the vindication thereof, and now Satan and his wicked angels go forth to make war upon and maliciously try to destroy all of those who keep God’s commandments.—Kev. 12:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The conflict or war in which Jehovah’s witnesses engage is not with human creatures, that is to say, with flesh and blood. We once were led to believe that this was their fight, and that they must develop a perfect character in order to get to heaven. But that is not their real fight. In recent years </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoieer </span><span class="font3">has time and again declared that we have no fight with men. Our fight is with Satan and a host of wicked spirits operating with him, which unseen wicked hosts use men as their dupes or agents, who are on earth and who willingly or unwillingly do the bidding of the unseen wicked powers. We have now come to the “last days”, that is to say, the days just preceding Armageddon, in which, as in the days of Noah, the earth is filled with wickedness by reason of the operation of Satan and his wicked allies. (2 Tim. 3:1-6) The great Spirit, Jehovah God, by and through his faithful servant Paul gave warning to.the followers of Christ Jesus who arc witnesses for Jehovah in these day;;, and who are therefore on the side of Jehovah, and the special objects of the enemy’s assault: “Finally, strengthen yourselves in the Lord, and in his mighty power. Put on the complete armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the crafty ways of the enemy.” (Eph. 6:10, 11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">l)ia&lt;/.)</span><span class="font3"> What enemies? Satan and his host, his wicked spirits, that have operated with him since the time of the rebellion, and concerning which wicked hosts the apostle says: “Because our conflict is not with blood and flesh, but with the governments, with the authorities, with the potentates of this darkness, with the spiritual things of wickedness in the heavenlies.” (Eph. 6:12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Viag.) </span><span class="font3">Why is that wicked crowd making war on Jehovah's witnesses? Because such witnesses are in God’s organization and engage in his service of delivering the message of truth, which Satan and his crowd do not want the people to hear, and because the truth pronounces the doom of Satan and his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Another translation of this text is here helpful to understood the matter. “Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might; put on God’s armor, so as to be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil. For we have a struggle not with blood and flesh, but with the angelic rulers, the tmgelic authorities, the potentates of the dark present, the spirit-forces of evil in the heavenly sphere.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> The Devil and his great tyrannical and maliciously wicked hosts are far more powerful than Jehovah’s witnesses. That wicked host misses no opportunity to make an assault upon the faithful. When they see Jehovah’s witnesses going forth to the work of bearing testimony to the name of the Most High that wicked crowd seeks the destruction of the faithful. Why, then, should Jehovah’s witnesses be bold in the proclamation of the truth and continue to sing forth Jehovah's praises and thus condemn the world? Why should they not proceed more cautiously and avoid offending God’s enemies? Rather, why should they proceed with the work without fear of devils or other wicked agents on the earth, as they arc now doing? The answer is that they go forth fearlessly because Jehovah of hosts is their fear and their sure protector. (Isa. 8:12, 13) The holy angels under the command of the Lord Jesus Christ as Jehovah's chief executive officer are sent before God’s faithful witnesses. These are keeping under surveillance and holding back the wicked ones, and thus the protection of those remaining faithful to God as his witnesses is guaranteed. “The angel of Jehovah cneampcth round about them that fear him, and dclivercth them.” (Ps. 34:7, A.fi’.F.) Except for the protection afforded to Jehovah’s witnesses the Devil and his wicked crowd would instantly destroy them. Those who love God and who remain faithful will have boldness in this day of judgment and continue to faithfully proclaim the message of the truth, knowing that no weapon formed against them can prosper.—1 John 4:17, IS; Isa. 54:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMUNICATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> The “spirits in prison” to which Jesus preached were not the wicked spirits or nephilim that form a part of Satan’s- organization. To have preached to that wicked crowd would have been entirely inconsistent and against the will of God, seeing that God had already sentenced them to destruction. It was to the “sons of God” who fell into Satan’s trap, and hence into his prison, that Jesus preached as stated by the apostle Peter. (1 Pet. 3:19, 20) Nor is there any Scriptural evidence that those “spirits in prison” have ever communicated with or attempted to communicate with any human creatures through mediums or otherwise. The Scriptural evidence is conclusive that the wicked spirits that joined Satan in his rebellion have communicated and do now continue to communicate wfith human creatures by use of willing mediums, and this they do for the very purpose of deceiving mankind and drawing men away from God and holding them in Satan’s snare. Jehovah provided in his law that all men or women practicing the fraudulent art of mediums, witches, necromancers or soothsayers should be put to death, because they are working as Satan's agents. (Ex. 22:18; Deut. 18:10) This is conclusive proof that the efforts of men and women to get in communication with the spirits is entirely contrary to God’s law and brings disaster upon those who practice such.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> Witchcraft and mediums are of Satan and the fruit of his rebellion: “For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.”—1 Sam. 15:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> This statement of Jehovah’s prophet announces the rule of Jehovah showing the direct relationship between rebellion and witchcraft and that stubbornness and lawlessness against God, the rejection of his Word, is the cause of one's falling into wickedness. Saul was the first king of Israel, which was God’s typical organization. Saul disobeyed God and rebelled. This supports the conclusion that witches or mediums represent the rebel Satan and his wicked associates who arc also rebels, and that such are the ones that communicate through witches or mediums with the human race. Saul sought advice from the witch of Endor after first having directed his servants to search out such a medium or witch. He fell completely under the control of the wicked spirits operating through that witch. (1 Sam. 28:7-16) Those wicked spirits induced Saul to believe that he was communicating with Samuel; but the context of the scripture shows that they were lying, because Samuel had long been dead, and the dead know not anything.—Eccl. 9: 5, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup>* Those wicked spirits with Satan continued to harass, defraud and mislead the Israelites, causing that people who constituted God’s typical organization to turn away from Jehovah and to entirely lose his favor. (Amos 3:2) When Jesus was on earth he preached the kingdom message to the Jews, and during that time these wicked spirits continued to harass the Jews and drive many of them into iniquity. “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick.”—.Matt. 8:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The Scriptures describe those wicked ones as “unclean spirits” and “devils”, of which Satan is the chief. These devils knew Jesus to be the Son of God, and without doubt knew that the judgment of destruction stood against them. “And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.” (Mark 1: 34) When Jesus cast out these wicked spirits and caused them to depart from the ones that they were afflicting, they cried out. “And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.” (Mark 1: 23-25) This is evidence that Jesus was not preaching to those wicked ones, but that they were practicing their wickedness and they feared that he had come to execute Jehovah’s judgment against them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> On another occasion Jesus met two men possessed of these devils: “And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? And there was a good way off from them, an herd of many swine, feeding. So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.”—Matt. 8: 29-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The present time, when the Lord Jesus at the temple is causing the proclamation of the truth to be made, and particularly the judgment of Jehovah concerning the destruction of these wicked ones, must be to them a time of real torment. No wonder they fight against Jehovah’s witnesses; and thanks be unto God who provides all the needed protection for those who remain faithful! The foregoing texts show that Jesus was not preaching to those wicked ones any message of reformation, but he was rebuking them and they feared the time of their execution had arrived. This is further proof that such wicked spirits are not the ones who sinned in Noah’s day. The two classes are clearly and distinctly* marked out by* the Scriptures, one doomed to absolute and complete destruction, the other having a possibility of recovery.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEIVERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Satan, that old Serpent and arch deceiver, together* with his wicked angels, has deceived millions of people in modern times. The organization designating itself “Christian Scientists” is a striking example of such deception. It is unbelievable that so many men and women who appear to be sincerely desiring to do right would willfully serve the Devil. Without a question of doubt they are deceived, and this wily foe, the Devil, has fixed up a scheme to turn them away* from God. He has thus induced many* persons to follow the teachings of a woman, and which teachings it is wrongfully* claimed are supported by the Scriptures. Men are induced to believe that they can heal the sick, and doubtless Satan lends all the power he possesses to temporarily heal them. They have fallen for Satan’s first lie, that there is no death (Gen. 3:4), and thus he has caused many of such persons to deny* the Lord and the blood of Jesus Christ that purchased the human race.—John 8: 44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Millions of other persons are deceived, being induced to believe that they can talk with their dead friends, when in fact they are communicating with those wicked spirits that have been opposed to God and righteousness since the days of Eden. Such wicked spirits act through mediums and by this means deceive those who do not adhere strictly to the Word of God. Many public officials in many of the countries consult these mediums, and thus consult the wicked spirits, in order to find out what they must do or what course they shall take, and thus the Devil carries on this wicked practice to turn men away from Jehovah and into unrighteousness. Every religious organization that has existed, beginning with Nimrod, Satan has oven-eached and used for his purpose. The most glaring example of this is the Homan Catholic hierarchy. Parading under the name of God and of Christ, that organization is used by Satan to deceive millions of people who have desired to do right but who are kept in ignorance of what is Jehovah’s purpose. The Jloman Catholic hierarchy is the strongest visible foe on earth of Jehovah’s witnesses, and that organization is desperately fighting to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. This is conclusive proof that the Homan Catholic hierarchy is Satan’s organization into which he has drawn and entrapped many good persons whom he desires to hold under restraint and away from God. In like manner Satan has held many persons in the Protestant churches under the control of their clergymen. It was even so in Noah's day that Satan entrapped the “sons of God’’. The fact that the clergy have joined hands with the political and financial interests of the world, all of which is under Satan, is proof conclusive that Satan has entrapped them and is using them for his purposes. Both the Catholics and the Protestants preach to the people that their dead friends are alive and conscious either in purgatory or in torment. Such is in substance Satan’s first lie spoken to man. (Gen. 3:4; John 8: 44) Many good people are induced to believe that their friends who have died arc suffering and in purgatory and ma5<sup>r</sup> now be aided by prayers said in their behalf by clergymen. All of such fraudulent practice originated with Satan and is carried on by him and his host of wicked ones. Now Satan knows that his time is very short until the great fight at Armageddon takes place, and he hastens to drive all men into spiritism or devilism and therefore against God; and for that reason at the present time there is a great turning to spiritism and spirit mediums throughout the land. All who follow the lead of Satan and his wicked allies will die at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PARAMOUNT TRUTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> What truth of and concerning these wicked spirits stands out as of paramount importance to all who w-ish to have and to hold the favor of Jehovah God? It is this: that there is but one place of safety, and that is to be in and to abide in the organization of Jehovah God. “Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.” (Ps. 46:10, 11, A.B.V.) Everything in opposition to Jehovah God will ultimately be destroyed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> Lucifer knew that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that he, Lucifer, was duty-bound to obey God. He was in God’s organization and willingly forsook it, setting himself up in opposition to God, and took away with him a host of angels who were under him. Such leaving of the organization of God means their destruction. Jehovah has been long-suffering toward them in this, that he has permitted Satan and his wicked host to continue in existence and to exhibit their wickedness until God’s due time to execute them. What God has prominently set out in his Word concerning this wicked crowd serves as a strong warning to all intelligent creation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Any creature once in God’s organization and who treats his privilege carelessly and indifferently opens himself to the subtle attack of the enemy. Yielding to the enemy's influence and then turning away from God’s organization and thereafter willfully opposing the same means that creature's certain destruction. Willful sin is knowingly violating God’s law. Such is wickedness, and all the wicked God will destroy.—Ps. 145:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>37</sup> Saul is another example of those once in Godri organization and who fail. Judas is another example of those once in God's organization who become willful, fall to the wiles of the Devil, and then willfully turn away and oppose God, and whose destruction ri certain. Such is the fate that comes to the “man of sin” or “son of perdition”. These were once in the truth, in God's favor, and in his organization, and because of selfishness turn away from God and sin'r'ev destruction. The apostle Peter concerning such says: “For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the &gt;vorld, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the, beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commani.ment delivered unto them.” (2 Pet. 2:20, 21) Israel as a nation was God’s typical organization and in his favor and had his protection, but that nation fell away to the Devil and suffered destruction. Likewise “Christendom”, or “organized Christianity”, began with the avowed purpose of serving God, but its leaders have turned away from God and Christ and have joined hands with the Devil's organization and must suffer destruction at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SAFETY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Where is safety to be found? And who are they that find such place of certain safety? The destruction of the world in Noah's day by the flood foreshadowed the destruction of the present world at Armageddon. Because Noah devoted himself to Jehovah, maintained his integrity toward God and continued faithful, he was righteous in the sight of Jehovah, At the direction of God Noah built the ark, which served as a place of safety and preservation of Noah and these associated with him. That foreshadowed that the only place of safety during the greatest tribulation of all time is to be found in Jehovah’s organization. Tho ark which Noah built at the command of God is therefore a picture of Jehovah’s organization, and symbolically says to all intelligent creatures: “Jehovah’s organization is the only place of safety.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The flood brought great tribulation upon the world. Armageddon will bring the greatest tribulation. (Matt. 24:21, 22) In the tribulation of Armageddon the opposers of God will find no way of escape, hence no place of safety. (Jer. 25:33-35) The fact that they call themselves Christians or by the name of Christ and God will furnish them no place of safety. Since the days of Enos men have been hypocritically calling themselves by the name of God, all of which is a mockery. (Gen. 4: 26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> God cannot be mocked with impunity. (Gal. 6:7) All who oppose Jehovah’s witnesses in their giving testimony concerning the kingdom of God will be destroyed, and that definitely includes the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” The nephilim, being those who rebelled with Satan, shall be destroyed with Satan at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font3">Book Two.) “The sons of God” who became disobedient and left God’s organization in the days of Noah have been imprisoned for a long time. They are yet alive, and it seems that their punishment may end approximately at Armageddon. Such of that company as turn-to righteousness may be saved and recovered. The “great multitude” class are those who consecrated themselves to do God’s will, were begotten of the spirit, and have since tried to uplift the world by remaining in the “churches”; and these arc held as prisoners by Satan’s organization. They will find no place of escape at Armageddon except through death. They are ‘appointed to die’ and, like Samson, those among them who stand steadfast in the Lord will pull down “organized Christianity” upon their heads and will die, but will be raised out of death and made servants to Jehovah’s capital organization.—Kev. 7:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TEMPLE COMPANY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> The final show-down is at hand, when every creature must stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom or on the opposing side. There is no middle ground. The temple company is in the most favored position and hence in the greatest danger, because more is required of them. They must abide faithfully in Jehovah’s organization, at all times having on and keeping on the “whole armor of God”, otherwise they will not be able to stand against the assaults of the enemy. The description of the armor of God shows that the temple company must have the truth and faithfully serve the truth by being wholly obedient to God’s great prophet, Christ Jesus. (Acts 3:23) They must be wholly and completely devoted to righteousness. They must be and remain at peace with each other and walk in unity and in peace. They must have absolute faith in God, make him their fear, and abide in his sanctuary regardless of what devils beset them and assault them. They must have an intelligent understanding of God’s purpose, and for that, reason must continue to feed upon the Word of truth; which Jehovah now reveals to them. They must at all times wield the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”. All this they must have and do now in order to maintain their integrity toward Jehovah. They must at all times be fair to each other and stand firmly together for the cause of righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> Some who now believe themselves to be in the temple and who probably arc in that condition manifest a spirit that puts them in the gravest danger. Among other things, they manifest a desire to punish some of their brethren. They seek to find fault with their brethren and report them for the purpose of getting them into difficulties, having a desire to sec them fall. They fail to remember the unalterable rule which Jehovah has announced, to wit: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” Those who thus act as spiritual policemen for their brethren often find themselves in great distress and trouble, which is due to the fact that they neglect to abide by the Word of the Lord, which is: ‘See that you suffer not as a busybody in other men’s affairs.’ (1 Pet. 4:15) Jehovah’s unalterable rule, and which now applies specifically to tho temple company, is that they must “do justly”; which means that every one of the temple must do that which is right and fair, towards his brethren especially; “love mercy,” which means the very opposite of a desire to injure another or to inflict punishment upon another, but having a desire to help one in trouble who really seeks or desires help; “walk humbly with thy God,” which moans to be fully obedient to Jehovah, pursuing at all times a course wholly devoted to righteousness. These rules require one to be guided strictly by what is laid down in the Scriptures, and hence all must inform themselves. (Micah 6: 8) Be sure that you do not suffer for wrongdoing; and if you are suffering for doing right remember the admonition of the apostle in this connection: ‘It is better to suffer for well doing.’—1 Pet. 3:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JONADAB COMPANY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> God’s witness Noah, the “preacher of righteousness”, foreshadowed the faithful remnant now on the earth. Those persons with Noah in the ark foreshadowed the Jonadab company now on the earth who associate themselves with God’s organization. These have the promise that, performing the conditions named, they may be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger. (Zepli. 2:3) The conditions are that they attach themselves to the Lord’s organization, and they must remain there steadfastly serving God, working in harmony with Jehovah’s witnesses, and refusing to compromise with the world. Any attempt to remain in the organization or “chariot” of the Lord and at the same time to support the wicked world, even with the unwise desire of lifting up the world, will meet with disaster. The paramount truth, therefore, revealed in connection with the spirit creatures that sinned, and which is for the benefit of those now living, is this: that Jehovah’s organization is the onlj<sup>r</sup> place of safety, and one who once avails himself of that safety and then voluntarily leaves the same, is certain of destruction. Those who arc of the Jonadab company must continue to faithfully study God’s purposes as embraced in his Word; and hence the publication of the Lord’s Word is for their benefit. They must show their love for God by being diligent in keeping his commandments. For the benefit of the temple company, and also for the benefit of those who join themselves to God’s chariot, the Lord has now pulled back the curtains and permits his light to shine in the faces of those who have devoted themselves to him, and gives them a view of things that now must shortly come to pass, as well as the meaning of things that, have come to pass in the sixty centuries gone by. The truth that stands out and is made to appear in the vision as of paramount importance to all others is this: Jehovah, the Almighty God, is the Giver of life, and he will preserve those who love and obey him and who remain steadfastly faithful to his organization, at all times manifesting an unfaltering and unbreakable love for Jehovah. The crucial test upon all intelligent creation is here. Let all such take warning and beware. “Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” —Hab. 2: 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.B.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> Satan and his wicked host will continue to assault all who take their stand on the side of the Lord. This requires resistance on the part of Jehovah's anointed. It furnishes an opportunity for them to prove their loyalty and maintain their integrity. As an illustration: God permitted Satan to attack Job and bring upon him great affliction, but said to Satan: ‘Do not take his life.’ (Job 2:G) Jehovah will not permit Satan to destroy the right to life of any of his anointed who remain faithful to him. They must die, of course; but, being faithful unto death, they shall receive the crown of life. The Devil and the wicked angels likewise assaulted Jesus and continued to do so for three and one-half years. They succeeded in causing his death, but God raised him out of death and thus demonstrated his supreme power and made manifest his reward to those who are faithful. The Jonadab company will be assaulted by Satan and his wicked agents and allies. If they stand firm and remain faithful and true to God and his organization, they will be preserved. These truths are now of greatest importance. They were written aforetime for the comfort and aid of the remnant and for those that are associated with the remnant. It behooves each one of Jehovah’s witnesses to aid others to understand these truths who have a desire to know and to serve Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE BODY OF THE CHRIST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font3">S THE divine High Priest of the Melchizedck order Christ Jesus was raised from the dead and ascended into heaven, and there he appeared in the presence of Jehovah God and presented tile value of his human sacrifice as an offering for sin. (Heb. 9: 24-26) His sacrifice was acceptable to Jehovah, and was accepted; and the acceptance was made manifest by God’s pouring out of the holy spirit and by the cloven tongues of fire that rested upon his disciples at Pentecost, the fiftieth day after Jesus’ resurrection. (Acts 2:1-4) Thus Jehovah God opened the way for life and immortality through Jesus Christ, his beloved One.—2 Tim. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptural proof establishes, therefore, the fact that the Logos (or Word of God), Jesus, and Christ Jesus, are one and the same person. That be did not die when he came to earth to be born as a man, but that his life was transferred from heaven to earth, is proved by his words to the Jews, namely: “Before Abraham was, I am.” (John 8:58) Abraham lived two thousand years before Christ Jesus was born on earth. Hence the Lord’s words imply a continuous existence. To die means to go out of existence. Jesus’ words, therefore, must be construed to mean that from the time of the beginning of creation until the moment he spoke those words he had existed and had the right to exist. He died upon the tree as a man and must, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as a mun,</span><span class="font3"> for ever remain dead, but the right of his life as a man he gives for the life of the world. This is proved by his words: “I have power to lay it [my life] down, and I have power to take [receive] it a gain. This commandment have I received from my Father.” —John 10: IS; 6: 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus alone is sufficient to execute Jehovah’s purpose. He alone provides the ransom price for mankind. It hap pleased Jehovah God, however, in the exercise of his loving-kindness, to select others to he members of that company which the Scriptures call the “body” of Christ and therefore to be a part of The Christ, Jesus being the Head thereof. In doing this God does not select angels to be a part of The Christ, but he selects men and women who have the faith like unto that of Abraham, “the friend of God.” (Heb. 2:16, 17) God visits the nations to take out from them a people for his name. (Acts 15:14) These are made acceptable unto God through Christ Jesus, and in no other way. God did not predestinate the individuals who will make up the body of Christ, but he did predestinate that there should be a number selected from amongst men to make up that body. Concerning this it is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved: in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.”—Eph. 1: 3-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The nation of Israel was once the chosen people of God. They did not constitute God’s new creation, but that nation </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">foreshadowed</span><span class="font3"> the new creation, which creation is God’s people selected and elected for a purpose. (Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17) Israel after the flesh was the moving picture which was provided by Jehovah and which foreshadowed the real thing, which real thing is, to wit, spiritual Israel, the new creation. Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel, was the beginning of the Israelites after the flesh. Jacob’s natural offspring were born under the terms of Ihe law covenant which Jehovah confirmed with them at Mount Sinai in Arabia. The new creation is spiritual Israel begotten and brought forth as “a people for his name” under the terms of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Israelites entered into a covenant with Jehovah, by and through the prophet Moses as their mediator or go-between. By agreeing to the terms of the covenant they bound themselves to be obedient to God’s will. That covenant confirmed at Sinai served as a schoolmaster to safeguard and lead obedient ones of the Israelites until God’s due time to begin the m&gt;w creation, which is The Christ. (GaL 3: 24) The nation as a whole failed to keep the terms of the covenant and lost everything that that covenant promised. A small remnant of that people, however, did accept Christ as the great Redeemer and Deliverer; and by the grace of God such became a paid of the new creation.—Rom. 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To natural Israel God said at Mount Sinai: “Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children o£ Israel.”—Ex. 19: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To spiritual Israel, foreshadowed by natural Israel, that is to say, to those who have accepted Christ as their Redeemer and have come into Christ, the Lord God says through his appointed witness: ‘‘But you arc a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a purpose.” (1 Pet. 2: 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> This scripture and the one just previously quoted prove conclusively that Israel after the flesh was the picture foreshadowing Israel after the spirit, which is the reality; and that the reality is God’s new creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new creation, which is spiritual Israel, is begun and completed by the terms of a covenant. Jesus the Head thereof made a covenant with Jehovah at the Jordan liver to do his Father's will. That covenant entailed upon Jesus the sacrificing of himself as a man. There is no evidence that he knew at the time he made the covenant that he was to die. lie spent forty days and nights in the mountain, studying God’s purpose and communicating with Jehovah after his mind had been illuminated by the holy spirit, which descended upon him in the form of a dove. Then he would know, and then and thereafter he intelligently and faithfully carried out his covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The members of his body must follow in the same way as Jesus went. (1 Pet. 2:21) All who become members of the new creation must do so by and through a covenant of sacrifice as the initial stop. (Ps. 50: 5) A covenant is a solemn agreement to do or not to do a certain thing. When the disciples of Jesus believed he was the Messiah or Christ, and became his followers, they thereby agreed to do the will of God. When they accepted Jesus as the Messiah, that was the beginning of their covenant. That marked their consecration to God. They could not be justified until the ransom sacrifice of Jesus was presented in heaven as a sin-offering and there accepted. The acceptance was manifested at Pentecost, and then and there these disciples were anointed as justified and spirit-begotten sons of God who were called and accepted to be God’s witnesses on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new creation is a select or elect company who are taken out from amongst men and then adopted into the family of God through Christ. God’s manner of selecting and forming the new creation is important. His Word tells in what manner he selects and develops the members thereof. This information discloses how one becomes a real Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since all the human race is born in sin and no man who is a sinner can approach God, what can a sinner do to become a Christian and thereby a member of the new creation? The Scriptures declaring that life is a gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, it is manifest then that knowledge of the gift and of how it is given is the first essential. Man must learn first, cither by being informed by someone or by reading from the Word of God, that he is a sinner, that he needs help, and that he is unable to help himself. Seeing that the course of mankind is unrighteous he must have a desire for righteousness. He learns that Jehovah is God, and believes that fact. This constitutes faith in God, without which it is impossible for him to please God. (Ilcb. 11:6) He then learns that Jesus Christ is the beloved Son of God, -whose life was given as a ransom for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His fear of God is the beginning of -wisdom. (Ps. Ill: 10) That means that he is now beginning to apply his knowledge in harmony with God’s will, and this he docs when he begins to fear Jehovah. He has a desire to know more about Jesus and why he died and was raised from the dead. By this knowledge ami desire God draws him to Jesus. This is in harmony with the statement made by Jesus, namely: ‘‘No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” (John 6:44) It is thus seen that an honest and righteous desire to live, and to live in harmony with the Creator, is one of the first essentials for one to become a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is reasonable to conclude that God so surrounds such a one with circumstances that would attract him to the Lord Jesus, and thereby draw him to Jesus. Proof of this is found in the experience of Cornelius, the Roman centurion who became the first Gentile convert to Christianity. He knew nothing of God’s purpose to save through Jesus Christ, but he did have faith in and reverence for Jehovah. He had an honest and righteous desire to be in harmony with God. He prayed to God, and his prayer ascended unto God as a memorial. (Acts 10:1-48) In due time Jehovah brought to his attention the knowledge of his way to life, by sending the apostle Peter to him to tell him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So it often occurs when one has an honest desire to know the Lord that someone comes his way and places in his hand a book, or tells him something of God's gracious provision for salvation. When he receives this knowledge into a good and honest heart he kains that God’s way for man to return to him and get life everlasting is through Jesus Christ. The testimony of Jesus is: ‘‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”—John 14:6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up to this point the man has been going in the way of sinners. His mind has been devoted to things selfish. Having a desire for life, and now seeking the way to life, he repents. Repentance means a change of mind. By the knowledge thus obtained he 1ms changed his mind, and desires to know God’s way to life. In this inquiring attitude the words of Jesus now’ apply to him: ‘‘If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.”—Matt. 16:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To obey this injunction from Christ Jesus means to make a consecration. One who consecrates himself to God thereby agrees to do God’s will. The man, now believing that he is a sinner and that Christ Jesus is his Redeemer, and that the way back to Jehovah and to life is through Christ Jesus, says in substance if not in terms: ‘I am determined to do God’s will’; and then solemnly and reverentially in his mind or by his lips he says to Jehovah: ‘Trusting in thee and in thy Word, and believing in the precious blood of Christ, I do now agree to do thy holy will.’ This constitutes a denial of self; this is his consecration; and since it is his agreement to do the will of God it is man’s part of his covenant with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It may now be properly said that the man is converted. To be converted means to change one’s course of action. He changes his course of action by turning away from following selfish things and by agreeing to follow and by following the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus now stands sponsor for the one thus consecrating, because of his faith; and as man's mediator or advocate presents him to Jehovah. If the man’s justification by Jehovah follows, and his acceptance for sacrifice, immediately thereafter his begetting by the holy spirit as a son of God occurs. In due time the kingdom call or invitation is sent to him, and if he responds thereto and qualifies God accepts him and anoints him with his spirit, and thus he becomes a Christian and a member of the body of Christ.</span></p>

We</span><span class="font2"> have long been convinced that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch tower</span><span class="font2"> is the mouthpiece </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> Jehovah, and now realize that the Lord Jesus, from the temple, is providing the truths published therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The-ninny truths which have come to us in recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Towers </span><span class="font2">have been a great source of encouragement to us, and we are determined to work in the Lord’s vineyard as long as he commands us to do so. Jehovah’s lightnings reveal that spiritual Israel is in the new covenant and that it is our great privilege to have a share in tl.e vindication of Jehovah’s name. This knowledge gives us much joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Believing that service in the form of witnessing fiom door to door is the paramount duty of the followers of Christ today, this company has stiiven to faithfully perform such work in this locality. As Jehu drove his chariot furiously while on his mission to destroy Jezebel, so we too have, by the Loid’s grace, been keeping the wheels of our witness work turning as rapidly as possible. .So successful have we been in this that the end of the seventh month of our fiscal year finds us over the yearly quota, set for us by one of the Society’s regional service directors, in placements of books and booklets and in the number of testimonies given. Our quota for hours in the service has also been reached at the present writing. We give thanks to Jehovah, who giveth the increase, and by obeying him we have proved that “the joy of the Lord is |our] strength”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We face with confidence the approach of Armageddon, because our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our prayers for you, dear brother Rutherford, are that the all-powerful Jehovah may continue to protect and guide you in your work of supervising the activities of those in God’s visible organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We received the machine from Havana, but, although we had a dillicult task to clear same from the customs, through lack of piopcr invoice, vve nevertheless cousidetcd it the Lord’s provision that another machine is nil’orded us. We hope to leave no stone unturned where delivering the testimony is concerned; for the time is ripe for it, and vve have the equipment with which to proceed. We continue to pray for you. Accept greetings from the brethren in Jamaica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With best wishes,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH BOUNTIFULLY FEEDING THE REMNANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brothfi;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> UniiEitrimo:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greetings in Zion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Received the poitable phonograph yesterday, and how thankful we are to Jehovah God for this another means of witnessing to his great and holy mime! Words cannot be found to expte-s our appreciation for this machine. We hope to use it at every opportunity we have in singing forth his praises. We thank you, dear brother, and may the dear Lord continue to use you to his honor and glory'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We went out this morning in the service anti I found quite a bunch at one house and put on No. I of the Seiie-, and as 1 was leaving the house the man from the next door stopped me and said: “Stop up at the chuich anil demmwtrate what you have there; we have a large crowd up there and you can see them all together.” We thanked him, and asked when his Sunday school would be over. So vve were there on time to put on a couple more lectures for the whole Sunday school, L'io in all. All praise to Jehovah above, from whom all bh-.-aings How. I feel that has well paid for the machine; for these were a bunch of Holiness people who would not listen to a word I tell them at their doors, and to think they sat there and listened to every' word you told them, and said, “That is gtand!” We hope to go back there again if the Devil doesn't get busy now. Today vve put on six lectures with small machine, and total attendance DiO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We wish to Jliank our heavenly Father for using you, dear brother, in bringing to light so many wonderful things about the covenants, which we have need of at this time. We are looking forward to the piece on the Hebrew chthhen in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> soon, which you gave at the Toronto convention. Jehovah God is bountifully feeding the remnant from his table nojv; and, oh, to be able to keep in the light at this time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much Christian love, yours in his service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mr. and Mrs.’ John</span><span class="font2"> E. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Miller, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the close, yesterday, of “The Nations’ Hope” Testimony Period the following resolution was adopted enthusiastically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We, the Jonadabs, of the Junior witness company of Jehovah’s witnesses of Fresno, California, do hereby declare our allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and his glorious kingdom and our thankfulness to Jehovah and his earthly organization for the privilege of service in joyfully declaring the name of Jehovah and his kingdom to the people of “Christendom”. The Los Angeles resolution is unanimously and enthusiastically adopted by us, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“ ‘Resolved,</span><span class="font2"> That we do now take our stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom; and that we will obey, servo and worship Jehovah God and his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, who is the rightful ruler of the world, and we will thus participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nearly 500 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recovery</span><span class="font2"> were placed by the juniors during the testimony period, and thousands of testimonies given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The neighbor children are joining in with us and were out almost every day of the campaign. One of the boys told a woman, “These books show how Jehovah is giving the people their last chance.” She said, “Then it’s a pass through Armageddon,” and he replied, “So far as I’m concerned it’s a nickel a pass. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">rTM LECTURES BREAKING DOWN PREJUDICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font2">received phonographs and records and wish to thank you </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">same. Want to assure you we will do our best to follow instructions and use them only to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Would also express our thanks for the portable transcription machine. We are very grateful for it. The lectures by 1’TM have broken down much prejudice and caused many people to come to our camp for literature. The people are waiting at their homes for the literature after hearing the lectures, and many pieces are placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We held a second lecture at the home of an old man (87) last night, who has bitterly fought “Itussellism” for years. After hearing “World Control” he said: “That beats all preaching I’ve ever heard. I am afraid I’ve been wrong in so bitterly opposing this and that I’ve been fighting the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We can notice loss of interest in clergy and churches where these lectures arc hold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With thanks to Jehovah for this added equipment for fighting Satan, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Byron and Nettie Tritt, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S LOVING-KINDNESS MANIFESTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Hallowell (Maine) company of Jehovah’s witnesses are unanimous in their appreciation and gratitude to Jehovah for the wonderful articles, which we have just finished studying, on “His Covenants”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s goodness and loving-kindness toward his people have been manifested in a most marked degree as he has given them the food that is convenient for them, to prepare them for the great day when his name will be completely vindicated and victory over Satan is fully established. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be assured that we are in heart harmony with this great organization of the Lord’s. May. the heavenly Father bless and strengthen you that you may be able to direct, aid and comfort his church, is the prayer of the Hallowell company of Jehovah ’s witnesses.</span></p>
