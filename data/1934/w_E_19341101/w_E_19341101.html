<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>FEAST OF CONSPIRATORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For they ent the bread of ivickedness, and drink the wine of violence.’’—Prov. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has forewarned the remnant that the ‘seed of the Serpent’ would form a conspiracy and carry it out to the limit of his ability, the purpose of which conspiracy is to destroy Jehovah’s anointed. To the witnesses of Jehovah now on earth is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, and because they try to fulfil their commission they arc hated by the Devil and all of his offspring. (Rev. 12:17; L’s. 83:2-5) Those in the conspiracy are attempting to cut off Jehovah’s anointed from being a nation; and this wicked crowd of conspirators is composed of Gog and a host of wicked spirit creatures who joined Satan in his rebellion at Eden and who continue to fight against the anointed; and of those on earth, the religious, political and commercial elements that operate, performing their respective parts, all of which is under the direction of Satan the Devil; hence all of these conspirators are the ‘seed of the Serpent’. Satan is proud, haughty, arrogant and austere. All of his offspring are likewise disposed. It is the divine rule that pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. (Prov. 16:18) In keeping with this rule Belshazzar the king of Babylon held a great feast, at which he and his assembled guests became very drunk. The feast was an occasion for much swaggering and boasting and great hilarity and carousal. The proverbial fall of the king of Babylon and his followers quickly came thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EPITOME</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Let the anointed remnant now on earth take comfort in this fact: that the divine record of Belshazzar's feast was kept and preserved until this day for their learning and that, the fulfilment of this prophetic picture having now begun, the understanding thereof gives strength to their hope of ultimate triumph through Christ Jesus, who leads the army of Jehovah against the enemy. In this prophetic picture Belshazzar represented the earthly offspring of the Devil, that is to say, the visible part of the ‘seed of the Serpent’, and he and his allies are in the conspiracy under the leadership of Gog; the “lords” picture all who are in the League of Nations or like combines; the golden vessels used at the feast, out of which the wine was drunk, pictured the remnant, Jehovah's witnesses, who are wholly devoted to him, which Sa-tan.’s crowd expect to completely discredit and then to destroy ; the fingers of the band that wrote upon the wall pictured Christ Jesus, to whom Jehovah has committed the testimony which must be delivered before the fall of Satan’s organization; Cyrus, the invading king, pictured Christ Jesus, the victorious Warrior who will clean out Satan’s organization. The fulfilment of this prophetic picture begins a short time before Armageddon and is concluded at Armageddon. The fulfilment has now begun, and hence it appears to be the will of God that his anointed remnant should have an understanding of the prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BELSHAZZAR AND HIS FEAST</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Belshazzar was a son (or grandson) of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon. (Dan. 5:2,18) Satan’s organization is named “Babylon”; hence Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon would picture Satan himself, while Belshazzar, being his son, would represent the earthly seed of Satan, particularly the rulers of “Christendom”, which are made up of the religious, political and commercial elements, the latter being the principal ones of the religious flock. “Belshazzar” means “prince of Bel” or “whom Bel favors”, and hence pictures “Christendom”, which is now drunk on Babylon’s wine, and under the leadership of Gog, the invisible field marshal of Satan who is assigned to lead the army of Satan at Armageddon. “Bel” was the chief god of Babylon, and hence means Satan himself. “And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.” (Jer. 51:44) In the first year of Belshazzar's reign Daniel had a drcam in which dream or vision he beheld four beasts, picturing the earthly ruling powers of Satan. (Dan. 7:1-3; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1933, page 180) In the third year of Belshazzar’s reign Daniel had a vision of the defiling of God's sanctuary and its later vindication.—Daniel 8; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1933, pages 179-1SG, 195-202, 211-219.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">323</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The time of the fulfilment of the prophetic picture of the feast of Belshazzar seems to be shortly preceding Armageddon. The record thereof as set forth in the fifth chapter of Damiel begins in this manner; “Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.’’ (Dan. 5:1) This feast was held in the king’s palace, and on the very night that Babylon was overthrown by the Medes ami Persians, and hence must picture a time after Christ begins his reign and is sent forth to oust the enemy and shortly preceding the battle of the great day of Cod Almighty. That definitely fixes the time of the fulfilment of the prophetic picture aft' r 1914 and shortly before the battle of Armageddon; hence both the scripture and the physical facts show that the prophecy is now in course of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The Chaldaic word for “feast” is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lichem,</span><span class="font3"> meaning “common eating together”. “A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketli merry; but money auswer-eth all things.” (Ec.cl. 10: 19) The greed for gain and power brought these, feaslers together in a great carousal or common drunken revel. The love of money, the root of all evil, brings into a common assembly those of all nations bent on reproaching the name of Jehovah and doing violence to those who serve God, which even now exists amongst the nations of “Christendom”. At the time of Belshazzar's hast war was on between the Chaldeans on one side and the Medes and Persians on the other, and doubtless the feast was held by Belshazzar that he and his men might for a time forget what was going on outside Iheir fortification and to afford them opportunity to further devise deeds of wickedness. (Prov. 4:17) Bread </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(lechem) </span><span class="font3">eating well pictured the eating of the common bread of conspiracy against Jehovah’s “hidden ones”. (Ps. 83:3) “Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.” (Ps. 14:4) The Chaldeans were eating behind the walls of the city, and hence in secret; and, being in secret, it was pleasant to them. (Prov. 9:17) The word “feast” in the Hebrew is derived from the word meaning “to feed on”, figuratively “to consume”, and by implication “to battle”, as in destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Today “Christendom” is in great fear and trepidation because of seeing the on-coming battle of Armageddon. They know something terrible is impending, but they have not the knowledge of God’s Word or faith in it to determine what it is. Like Pharaoh and his crowd in Egypt during the ninth plague, they are in great darkness. Even the pope is saying that his “holy year” proclamation has failed to bring forth fruit, ami has closed up the wall with golden bricks and called upon his allies to pray that Armageddon may be averted. He does not realize that Armageddon will be fought by the powers of Jehovah God. The rulers who sense the approaching battle or great trouble would like to minimize it and its frightful results, and hence they are drinking and eating together, which furnishes them some relaxation while they arc discussing and considering ways and me m.; for the elimination of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is noticeable at this time tiiat in every nation the ruling powers are following exactly this course. Belshazzar assembled a thousand of his lords, symbolically meaning the fullness or completeness of the earthly part of Satan’s organization. Antitypically it is now a great feast embracing all of “Christendom” and its dependencies, all of which are brought into the conspiracy against Jehovah and his anointed, that is to say, against all who are in line for the kingdom rnd who faithfully serve Jehovah God. Satan employs Lis ‘three frogs’ to gather the nations together for 1 tie battle. (Rev. 1G: 13-16) The.-.e magnates or “lord:,” more particularly picture those in the inner circle ci' “Christendom” who, together with the king or chief officers, control or rule the people. They consume i.wli wine at their feast, to give them fresh courage. Their hearts are heavy because of what, they sense is approaching, exactly as Jesus foretold, and hence Satan sees it is well to ‘give wine unto those of heavy hearts’. (Prov. 31:6; Luke 21:25,26) It is the “wine of violence” directed against Coil’s people and Ills cause. Satan having lost out in the battle in heaven, ins cohorts on earth now need wine to cheer them, because now is a time of “woe to the inliabiters [rulers] of the earth”. (Rev. 12:12) They arc seized with perplexity and distress. The “thousand of bis lords” al-o well picture the “ten kings” which “receive power as kings one hour”, which time ends at Armageddon. “These have one mind | to form and carry out t he conspiracy against God's chosen ones], and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. ’These shall make war 'with the Lamb.”—Rev. .17:12-14; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Litflit,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, pages 1(15, 106.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The place or seat of Belshazzar at the feast would be at the head of the banquet hall or table, and he would doubtless be surrounded by a select company, with plenty of secret service men in the wings of tr.c stage, well armed. His wine was red, and doubt le s his eyes also were red. “Belshazzar, whiles lie tasbd the wino, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the kin?, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.” (Dan. 5:2) The excessive wine of Babylon had stimulated and heated Belshazzar, ami now he felt strong and well able to carry out the will of his father the Devil. Hence his actions became reckless, malicious and regardless of the rights of others. Here again we must emphasize the fact that the Devil’s primary purpose on all occasions i-, to reproach the name of Jehovah God; and he was using Belshazzar on the occasion here considei vd to do that very thing. Full of wine, and reckless, Belshazzar gave command that the golden and silver vessels which his father had stolen from the temple at Jerusalem should be brought out and set before his guests, and out of which they were to drink. The golden vessels here mentioned represented those who are now diligent in putting forth their best endeavors to honor the name of Jehovah. The modern use of “wine” by the antitypical Belshazzar crowd finds its potency in the expression of Satan’s will in such things as the League of Nations, the World Court, peace pacts, “holy year,” international arms conferences, and like arrangements, employed for self-preservation and prosperity. Gog, Satan’s field marshal, puts the evil suggestions into the heads of the leaders of “Christendom”, and, of course, all such is inspired by Satan himself, as he is the chief one, sitting in his high and lofty position to direct the movements against Jehovah’s anointed ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>s</sup> The vessels of the temple of Jerusalem were for the sacred use in the service of Jehovah, and not for any selfish pleasure, which latter use would bring further reproach upon Jehovah's name. These vessels Belshazzar’s father had stolen from the temple and brought to Babylon, and now Belshazzar would desecrate them at his carousal. Belshazzar’s father had been guilty of great effrontery when he robbed the temple of these vessels, and now the use of them by this infidel, drunken crowd would add insult and bring further reproach upon Jehovah’s name. At the present time “Christendom’s” elect, which are the visible ‘seed of the Serpent’, would bring greater reproach upon Jehovah’s name by persecuting and humiliating and improperly ill-using God’s faithful remnant who bear testimony to his name and his kingdom and which faithful witnesses are declaring the day of God’s vengeance against Satan’s organization. Modern Babylon, or &quot;Christendom”, would desecrate these chosen vessels of the Lord by using them in a ridiculous manner, and thus in their carousal would make a merry time with them. It is noticeable at this time that the mouthpiece (or publicity agents, to wit, the pnblie press) of “Christendom” takes great delight in ridiculing and holding up to scorn Jehovah’s witnesses. ‘The king’s wives,’ mentioned in the account of the feast of Belshazzar, means the clergy who are married to the state or political power of the earth; and “his concubines” means the modern “Judas” company, or ‘sons of perdition’, who are not recognized as wives of the political element but who hire themselves out to the state or political ruling power for their own pleasure, to be used as instruments to bring about humiliating action against Jehovah’s witnesses. The “Judas” class, who are also in the conspiracy, now participate in the overt acts against the anointed of the Lord and seek means not only to interrupt the Lord’s work but to put Jehovah’s servants in embarrassing positions and cause violence to be inilieted upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• The army of Cyrus, at the time of the feast, was invading Babylon, and Jehovah had caused his prophet to say concerning this: “He shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward.” (Isa. 45:13) This prophecy, of course, applies to Christ Jesus, whom Cyrus foreshadowed, while Belshazzar, who now had possession of the vessels of the temple, foreshadowed the rulers of “Christendom” desiring to restrain Jehovah’s witnesses and prevent them from being properly used and to cause them to be used for an improper and unholy purpose. Also, Jehovah’s prophet said concerning the Devil, acting by his earthly agents, that he “opened not the house of his prisoners” (Isa. 14:17), meaning the ‘vessels of silver’, which representatively stand for the “great multitude”, who are now held in the prison house of “Christendom”, or modern Babylon. “Christendom” now resists the kingdom of Christ Jesus, the Greater Cyrus and invading King, and also refuses to permit Jehovah’s witnesses full freedom in their activities of service, while at the same time Babylon holds the “great multitude” in “the prison house” and restrains and pievents them from going free from “the prison house”. —Isa. 42:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>111</sup> All of Satan’s organization is against Jehovah’s anointed, who are pictured by the “golden vessels” mentioned in the prophecy. The religious leaders, the political bosses, and the commercial giants are the favored ones of “Christendom”, while the smaller fry, the strong-arm squad and the hangers-on do the heavy work and apparently the dirtier, contemptible work. “Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God, which was at Jerusalem ; and the king, ami his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.” (Dan. 5:3) It may well be .surmised that those that brought out these vessels did not handle them in a kind and delicate way. Today it is the strong-arm squad, acting on orders, that bring forth the “golden vessels” of the Lord, that is to say, the faithful remnant who arc Jehovah's witnesses; and they do not handle them in any soft and delicate way, but rudely, and speak to them with harsh and angry words. These, faithful ones arc, by Jehovah’s grace, maintaining their integrity toward him and have obeyed his commandments to ‘buy of him gold tried in the fire’. (Rev. 3:1&gt;&gt;) Each one of the faithful remnant is a ‘vessel unto honor, sanctified and made meet for the Master’s use’ and engaged in a good work. (2 Tim. 2: 20, 21) Be it noted in the prophetic account that the “silver vis-sels” mentioned in the prophecy were not brought out, but only the “golden vessels” were brought out. The “silver vessels”, representing the “great multitude”, are held in custody in the prison houses as prisoners, and these in due time must take their stand for Jehovah even at the cost of their lives; but that time has now about arrived. (Rev. 7:9-14) The brineiiig of these golden vessels out would mean the bringing of them into view and exhibiting them to the drunken revelers. Likewise, antitypieally, Jehovah’s witnesses are brought forth and exposed to the view and exhibited before the drunken revelers of “Christendom”. The purpose of this part of the conspiracy is to make Jehovah’s witnesses the center of ridicule and reproach by centering attention upon them while the revelers attempt to make them appear ridiculous. The king, and his princes, wives and concubines, drank wine out of the golden vessels; showing that the entire crowd of modern times indulge in overt acts in furtherance of their wicked conspiracy. The revelers, both ancient and modern, being drunk with the wine of Babylon, they get cheer and hilarity’<sup>-</sup> out of misusing Jehovah’s witnesses. Jn this manner those of “Christendom” show themselves as being on the side of God’s vilifiers; and thus they don the garments of Baal and mark themselves for the slaughter that must shortly follow at Armageddon. (2 Ki. 10:18-27; Jer. 25:33-36) All nations of “Christendom” now hate Jehovah’s witnesses, as Jesus foretold, and all are engaged in a conspiracy and are doing what they can to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name by ill-using such witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The wicked one Satan, who commercialized the human race and debauched the whole world, has poured the potion for his earthly representatives who are doing his will by persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses. “They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.” (Dan. 5:4) It is the wine of Babylon that is being drunk out of the golden vessels from Jehovah’s temple, and this adds to the hilarity of the rulers, and they get a great thrill out of it, and this induces them to praise everything except Jehovah and those who arc on his side. The language of this part of the prophecy further identities the revelers as the ‘seed of the Serpent’ and the worshipers of the Devil and his organization. In the divine record concerning the dream of Nebuchadnezzar recorded and interpreted by Daniel (see Daniel, chapter two) the organization of Satan was pictured by a great metallic image, the gold thereof picturing the Devil himself, while the other metals, in their order, pictured other portions of Satan’s organization; hence these revelers at Belshazzar’s feast give praise, -while drinking, ‘to the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone,’ and thus they identify themselves as a part of Satan’s organization that is fighting against Jehovah and his kingdom. The modern “Chaldeans”, that is to say, “Christendom,” revere and worship the strong ones of the world organizations, and with trembling voice and hypocritical hands uplifted thej' cry out concerning the League of Nations, ‘It is the only light that there is’; and thus they ‘change the truth of God into a lie, and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator’, even though outwardly, hypocritically and fraudulently they claim to represent the kingdom of Christ.—Rom. 1:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> It was in 1928 that the seventh “plague” was poured out, and in the year following the great commercial crash began; and yet the Babylonians, that is, those of “Christendom”, have not changed their worship nor repented of their wicked works. “And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.” (Rev. 9: 20, 21) Now, -with the- ever increasing proclamation of the truth, the rulers in “Christendom” have an opportunity to see what is right, but they continue the persecution of those faithful and true witnesses of Jehovah. Those composing “Christendom’s” oruanization like to pose as the law-abiding, peace-making and prosperity-making crowd, and to this end they seek and use the law-making and law-enforcement powers to bring the anointed ones of God into disrepute and to subject them to great humiliation. They take this course of action upon the false pretext and false claim that Jehovah’s witnesses are a menace to the peace of the existing governments. The truth of God’s Word when told relleets very unfavorably upon the iniquitous doctrines and work of those who rule in “Christendom”, and in their anger and in furtherance of their conspiracy they enact laws to prevent the telling of such .Scriptural truths to the people, and take whatever course they can to cause the truth to he suppressed. They conspire together to destroy freedom of speech, freedom of press, and the free expression of one’s understanding of God's Word; and all of this they do upon the wrongful claim that such is necessary in order to maintain the peace of the state. They wrongfully use Jehovah’s anointed vessels of gold, that is to say, his witnesses, and they would prevent the delivering of the testimony of Jesus Christ which God has commanded now must be delivered. They are foolish in believing that they can defeat Jehovah and put him to greater shame. Jehovah now has the entire drunken crowd in derision. (Ps. 2:4) It is time for the handwriting concerning the wicked crowd of “Christendom” and their end to appear upon the wall. It docs appear!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HANDWRITING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Men sometimes make themselves drunk to drive away distress and perplexity; and for some years last past there have been great distress and perplexity among the ruling elements of the w’orld. But a dreadful shock will bring even a drunken man to his senses to some degree. That was the effect upon Belshazzar, and the picture will be fulfilled. Belshazzar and his lords were in distress concerning the approach of the Medes and Persians, and they were drunk, and continued to drink out of the golden vessels in order to bolster themselves up. Likewise the rulers of modern “Christendom”, which is Satan’s organization, misuse God's anointed in their attempt to give themselves courage; and while they are doing it they get a jolt. “In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.”—Dan. 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The modern application of the words “the same hour” manifestly is to the short period of time in which Satan prepares his organization for the final battle. (Ilcv. 12; 12) “And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings [foreshadowed by Belshazzar and his lords], which . . . receive power as kings one hour with the beast [that is, the image of the 'sea beast’, which is the combine of nations].” (Rev. 17:12) These all act together against Jehovah's anointed ones in the short time when Satan is preparing for the battle of Armageddon. “Babylon” is the name of Satan’s crowd, and stands for or represents his organization both invisible and visible, and concerning which it is written: “That great city Babylon, . . . in one hour is thy judgment come.” (Rev. 18:10,19) This is the time of the handwriting’s appearing on the wail in fulfilment of the prophetic picture; and the facts show that this time began with the London convention in 192G, al which a testimony was issued To </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the Rulers of the World.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The “fingers of a man’s hAnd”, which did the writing on the wall, pictured Jehovah’s power exercised and by his “right hand”, Christ Jesus. (Matt. 12: 28) The Lord Jesus at the temple uses the faithful remnant in connection with his work in serving notice upon the visible part of Satan’s organization, and of this fact the invisible part of the enemy organization no doubt takes notice. (2 Cor. 3:2,3) Of himself Jesus said: “If I with the finger of God |the power of Jehovah] cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.” (Luke 11:20) Concerning the third plague of Egypt the magicians said to Pharaoh: “This is the finger of God.” (Ex. 8:19) The law written on the tables of stone was'“written with the finger”, that is, the invisible power or spirit, of Jehovah. (Ex. 31:18) Thus God causes Christ Jesus to bring forcibly to the attention of the enemy notice and warning of the enemy’s early downfall. The fingers of the man’s hand “wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall”, hence in the well lighted surface of the wall, thus forcing the revelers to see it. This illustrates how Jehovah does nothing in the dark, but that he acts against the enemy only after full warning, and he causes his witnesses to openly and aboveboard declare his judgments against the enemy. The enemy will never be able to say that they did not hear and that they unintentionally overlooked what Jehovah said to them. He illustrates this by compelling Belshazzar and his lords to take notice of the writing on the wall. It was Belshazzar’s candles that lighted the wall of his palace, and likewise today the truth of God’s Word is forced into the light which the rulers of modern Babylon, or “Christendom”, cause to burn, and they are compelled to take notice of the message of truth whether they want to do it or not. Today the rulers exhibit perplexity and distress, and at the same time they are drinking the wine of Babylon in their efforts to hide their perplexity while they go on feverishly preparing for war. While they are thus doing Jehovah causes the message of truth to be put before them under the light, and which message in substance says to them: “Soon you will have a fight, and a losing fight.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> In London, England, the “seat of the beast”, a warning was sounded openly and aboveboard in May 192G, which message was heard by the ruling powers of “Christendom”, but at which they scoffed mid which they have spurned, and that message marked the beginning of their “transgression of desolation”. The handwriting, the message on the wall, was notice and warning to Belshazzar and his revelers, and corresponds with the plagues upon Egypt, which also served as notice and warning to the rulers in Satan’s visible organization. “The king saw the part of the hand that wrote,” but he did not see the power that moved the hand. Today “Christendom’s” rulers have seen Jehovah’s human agents used in serving to give them notice of warning, and they have heard the notice of warning, but they have not seen or discerned Jehovah’s spirit which moves such agents or servants to bring that notice of warning to them. The handwriting on the wall was by the power of God, and for that reason could not picture the present-day depression or bad economic conditions that affect the world. That handwriting on the wall foretold disaster to Belshazzar the king of Babylon and his army ; and in modern times the fulfilment thereof foretells the doom of Satan’s organization, which is Babylon including “Christendom”. The judgment, notice and warning must be delivered before the execution of the judgment, and that is why Jehovah’s witnesses engage in declaring the day of the vengeance of our God. Such notice must be served before the giving of the message described by the prophet: “One post shall run to mc.'l another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon [Belshazzar and the modern rulers of ‘Christendom’] that his city is taken at one end [on every quarter, Ii.E.], and that the passages are stopped [surprised, ; seized, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.K.V.],</span><span class="font3"> and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.” (Jer. 51:31,32) From 192G to 1933 Jehovah’s message of warning heralded by his faithful witnesses was boldly delivered and raised high by wide publication, and thus “Christendom” was compelled to take notice of that message of warning, and which message of warning must be delivered before the fall of Babylon is complete.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Belshazzar and his revelers in wine were compelled to take notice of the si on or handwriting appearing on the wall, and the sight thereof somewhat sobered them; especially was that the effect upon the king. The rulers of “Christendom” have not been able to ignore the notice of warning that Jehovah has caused his witnesses to proclaim before them. They have been compelled to give the matter some thought; and the facts show that they have thought, and some of them have thought seriously. They have been sobered for a time, but this has served only to harden their hearts. “Then the king’s countenance [brightness, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I(.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin] was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.’’ (Dan, 5: 6) It was in 1928 that the Lord caused his remnant to make a declaration of Jehovah’s judgment which is written against Satan and all of his organization, and to give warning that all who would live must take the side of Jehovah. That message of notice and warning was proclaimed throughout “Christendom’’, and as to the rulers thereof it somewhat loosened their joints and caused their knees to knock together. That would sober them for a time. Shortly thereafter the great commercial erash came and Babylon began to sober up a little more, and the chief ones thereof showed a dull countenance instead of a bright one. By his prophet Jehovah tells them now to howl, because their howling days are short. “IIowl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall melt: and they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Imj</span><span class="font3"> in pain as a woman that travail-cth; they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.” (Isa. 13:6-8) While they arc howling evidently Jehovah laughs at them.— Ps. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> This corresponds to the prophecy uttered by Jesus, to wit: “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the c-rth: for the jiowcrs of heaven shall be shaken.” (Luke 21: 25,26) Although “Christendom’s” mighty men bring forth Ihe League of Nations compact, peace treaties, disarmament conferences, “holy year,” national recovery acts, yet their howling continues. In that period the pope regains his temporal power and the other parts of “Christendom” receive his delegates or ambassadors. He declares 1933 a “holy year”; and when he sees that has failed he continues to howl with his other allies and asks them all to pray that Armageddon may be prevented. Within this same hour, with increased zeal and activity Jehovah’s remnant places the message of the Lord God high up on the wall, and God has compelled <sup>4</sup> he rulers in “Christendom” to read the message although they do not understand it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> For many years the clergy have held the position of spiritual advisers to the other ruling elements of Babylon, or “Christendom”. True, some of these clergy are Catholics, some are Protestants, and some arc Jew’s; but all are engaged in the same business for hire. Naturally they are now being called upon to give advice and counsel and consolation to the other rulers in “Christendom”. “The king eried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.” (Dan. 5:7) This description of the king’s advisers given in the prophecy shows that these advisers include not only the clergy of the various religious organizations but also the professional economists, historians, philosophers and such like in the present time, and which are designated by Babylon’s publicity agents as “tl c brain trust”, meaning, of course, those that have great “wisdom”. The seventh “trumpet” for Jehovah and against Satan and his organization was sounded in 1928, and shortly thereafter, as it should be expected, the riding powers of “Christendom” pictured by Belshazzar would begin to cry out; and that is exactly what did come to pass. In 1928 a world conference was held in Paris, and another in London the next year, for the evident purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the threatening conditions anil of the signs, notices or declarations that had been given. That was after the “sign in heaven, great and marvellous”, had appeared. (Rev. 15:1) The time having arrived to vindicate Jehovah’s name, his witnesses would came the trumpet to sound and to give notice, and discomfort came to the earthly rulers as a partial re .till theie-of. King Belshazzar appealed to his own advisers for help, and even so the rulers in “Christendom” in modern times have assembled its “wise men” that wisdom might result from such multitude of counsel and that they might determine what to do. Of course, none of Jehovah’s witnesses would be called to such a conference; for such conference is anti-God and anti-kingdom, and Jehovah’s witnesses would not be wanted there, neither would they want to be there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar’s feast was in a foreign language, a language not known to Belshazzar, and, even if he could read it, he was not learned therein and was not able to interpret the same. Likewise the ‘seven angels having the seven last plagues’ were messengers not of a human organization, and consequently the message was not of human interpretation. The rulers of “Christendom” saw the activities of Jehovah's witnesses and heard what they were declaring, but the force and significance of their message needed some explanation or interpretation. Belshazzar wanted an explanation of what he saw on the wall, and in modern times “Christendom’s” rulers want to know the meaning of the present-day events, including what Jehovah’s witnesses declare, and to find this out they ask their own clergymen and “wise men”. No doubt the activities of these faithful witnesses have been frequently discussed in Ihe secret conferences of the “wise men” of the modern day.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The “Monday Morning Ministerial Conferences” have often been occupied with a consideration of these matters without reaching any satisfactory conclusion. When it appears that the public press, which is the advertising part of Satan’s visible organization, begins to give attention to what Jehovah’s witnesses are doing, then it must be known for a certainty that the “wise men” of “Christendom” have been discussing the matter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Belshazzar sobered up for a brief season and had his counselors brought in. “Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.” (Dan. 5:S) They must have been a sorry lot when they, composing the “brain trust” of his administration, appeared before the king, and not one of them able even to read the handwriting, much less to make known the interpretation thereof. The same thing is true today. The wise counselors of “Christendom” are unable to read the signs or interpret the same because they ignore (Jud’s Word. Especially since 1929 the ruling powers of “Christendom” have appealed to the “wise men” of their own organization to place a construct ion upon or explain what is the meaning of the ‘signs and wonders in heaven’, that is to say, the declarations made by Jehovah’s witnesses and their continuous work in bearing witness to the people, and what relation the same has to the distress and perplexity upon the earth. But none of the wise men of Babylon can read or interpret the same, because it is all foreign to them. Their Bibles do not read that way. One is reminded of the words of Jehovah’s prophet applying to the same crowd, to wit: “And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Bead this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed.” (Isa. 29:11) The advisers of Belshazzar undoubtedly attempted to advise, him, but, being careful to make no guess that would worry the king, they were anxious to tell the king, and did tell him, that “everything will be all right; behold the strength of our walls”. They, being in the service of the Devil, of course, would be unable to have any knowledge of the secrets of Jehovah. (Ps. 25:14) Likewise in modern times, the “wise men” of “Christendom” are careful to predict nothing that would be offensive to the political and financial ruling element; hence they say: “Give no heed to these foolish Jehovah’s witnesses, because every day and in every way the world is getting better. Everything will be all right. Behold the strength of our great institutions. We must stand for ever.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The declarations of Belshazzar’s wise men did not please him; and it is just the same today. The wise men of “Christendom” cannot give any answer that is pleasing and satisfactory to their allies. “Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.” (Dan. 5:9) As Belshazzar was troubled and his countenance was dark, and his lords sat about with long and astonished faces, even so it is today. The modern “brain trust”, including the clergy, and particularly the Catholic hierarchy, make an effort and try to give advice to the political and financial ruling element, but the latter have little or no confidence in such adviee. They become more perplexed every day, and they know not which way to turn. That perplexity has continued to increase since 1929, some evidence of which is here mentioned. In June 1931 the president of the United States issued a statement strongly advocating a moratorium of indebtedness of the various governments to the United States. In July 1931 the United States and France signed an agreement concerning foreign indebtedness and the moratorium went into effect. Then followed conference after conference looking to the recovery of the common interests of the nations and an effort to prevent the disastrous effects of war. Nations of “Christendom” agreed to scrap many of the battleships and otherwise limit war preparations, and then their perplexity and fear increased, and again they feverishly rushed out to construct even more war vessels and greater war equipment than ever before. Then came the NBA scheme, and it was thought this would pull the world, and especially the United States, out of the hole. This, together with other schemes, has been launched and pushed for the purpose of slaving off the disaster. Each nation in “Christendom” promulgates its own ideas of what should be done and how it should be done. The pope puts on his “holy garments” and tries his hand in an effort to bring about peace and prosperity in his “holy year”, and finally gives that up in disgust because it brings forth neither peace nor prosperity except to the pope and the Catholic hierarchy. No other institution would be able to provide gold bricks to stop a hole in the wall, which gold bricks came to them without effort on their part, except it might be said it was some effort to don their sparkling garments and lay the bricks. These things arc here mentioned to show the perplexity of the rulers of the world and chat the adviee given them by their “wise men” or “brain trust” fails to bring forth any satisfactory results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> There must have been confusion among the rulers at Belshazzar’s feast, and much talk, when the wise men failed to interpret the sign-words written on the wall of the banquet room. Belshazzar had spoken his words of disappointment, and those words had been taken up and repeated by the lords, and then by the smaller fry, and then by those who were serving the wine. At any rate, the fact got out to the queen. It is quite evident that the queen did not attend the banquet, because she heard what was going on and then she appeared at the feast to advise the king. “Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house; and the queen spake and said, O king, live for e' er; let nut thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thj- countenance be changed.” (Dan. 5:10) When the queen arrived at the banquet hall and beheld the troubled face of Belshazzar she greeted him in the customary and friendly way and badc him to be of good cheer, sinee she had something to suggest that might be of aid to him. Evidently she was not the wife of the king, but the mother queen, because the account of the prophecy says that the wives were there drinking wine. The mother queen seems to picture some men of the world friendly to the ruling clement and subject to them but who are entirely separate and apart from the religious frauds who pose as the spiritual advisers of the rulers. There are some men in public office wlio are friendly to the ruling powers but who have no confidence in or partnership with the hypocritical religious advisers. The queen appeared before Belshazzar but offered no explanation or interpretation of the handwriting. Having heard of the disturbed condition of the king and his lords, she had come to •suggest one who might be able to give the needed information. This indicates that she pictured some who arc in the world who are familiar with the conditions that exist and are somewhat familiar with Jehovah’s dealings with his faithful people, especially his dealings with them and their work at the time of the World War, from 1914 to 1918. It seems tho mother queen was used to bring Daniel to the favorable attention of Belshazzar, thus indicating that she represents someone that brings the attention of the ruling powers to Jehovah’s witnesses. At the time Daniel was approximately 100 years of age, and had previously served Nebuchadnezzar, and seems to have withdrawn from public service and was not on familiar or intimate terms of acquaintance with Belshazzar. The queen mother, knowing about this, came to bring to the attention of the king the man Daniel, and what he had done in previous years; and this shows that no one of the wise men of Babylon had recommended Daniel to the ruler. Likewise it shows that today not one of the “wise men” of “Christendom”, that is to say, the clergy and their allies, would recommend anyone of Jehovah’s witnesses to be calkd in and their advice asked as to the meaning of present conditions, not even so much as to suggest that they be asked as to whether the present-day events have any relationship to Jehovah and his prophecies long ago written. But today there are some men and wotntn who during the World War took notice of the treatment of those who were then faithful to God; and they also observed that such faithful followers of Christ Jesus were the only ones on earth that were then or are now qualified by the Lord to give a proper interpretation of and concerning that which now threatens the world destruction. Some of such men and women are in public office and hold positions under the ruling powers. They have a kindly feeling towards Jehovah’s witnesses and believe that such witnesses represent the Lord. Therefore they make an honest endeavor to draw the attention of the high ruling element to such witnesses and to recommend that such witnesses are trustworthy and that it is advisable that they be heard. Such friendly ones may be called persons of good will who have faith in God and believe that he has some representatives on earth, and for this reason they favorably commend Jehovah's witnesses, even as the queen mother recommendi d Daniel to the king. In this connection we are reminded of the words of the prophet: “And kings shall be thy nursing fathers </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> nourishers], and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shall know that I am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for mo.” (Isa. 49: 23) Among the ruling element there is now a division. Those of less power or importance in the world have a kindly feeling towards Jehovah’s witnesses and have exercised their influence in behalf of Jehovah's witnesses that they may have opportunity to be heard and to present their testimony concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. An example of this may be found in the fact that members of Congress in 1931 saw to it that Jehovah’s witnesses had opportunity to appear in person and give their testimony before the Congressional committee and to state the reason why they should be permitted to worship God in his appointed way without interference from others. Tho Lord will not forget such men who have shown their fairness in their desire that the truth might be heard.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The mother queen entered the banquet hall and greeted the potentate with the words, “() king, live for ever”; which seems to say that those of the pros' nt day whom the queen foreshadowed do not claim to be hostile to the earthly governments. They are now in position to furnish the facilities to open the way for Jehovah’s witnesses to tell God’s message before the rulers. These officers of good will are not seeking to overthrow tho present governments of earth, but they use formal words in greeting the ruling powers of earth and ask that the powers give opportunity for the testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses to be heard. As the queen mother said to Belshazzar, so these men in official positions say to the rulers of higher rank: “Let not your thoughts trouble you,” but give car to these witnesses of Jehovah and they may be able to find a solution of your difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Daniel’s past record was known to the queen; hence, addressing the king, she said: “There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holygods: and, in the days of thy father [Nebuchadnezzar], light, and understanding, and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers.” (Dan. 5:11) And so today the past record of the Lord’s “faithful servant” class is knov-n by some who recommend them to the favorable cm-sideration of “Christendom’s” ruling powers. These kindly and considerate men of the official family of the present rulers recall that Jehovah’s witnesses used the Bible testimony to point out the World War and ether difficulties that then and now beset the world, and that all their efforts are put forth in the spirit of kindness, and that they exhibit the wisdom that conies from above, and not the wisdom of man. They seeing that what these witnesses of the Lord have said and are saying finds support in the Bible, the recommendation is that they be publicly heard. Before 1918 there were some in the official element who observed closely what the Lord’s devoted people were saying and doing, and it was easy to be semi that such witnesses were much more sincere and possessed much more faith than the clergymen. Many honest men have seen that the clergymen, out of cruel hatred, cause the faithful followers of Christ Jesus to be greatly persecuted and that they did so during the World War merely because such faithful ones were preaching the truth of God’s Word. These honest men in official positions took notice then, and now they well know, that the clergy are hypocrites and practice hypocrisy while they falsely charge Jehovah’s witnesses with wrongdoing and persecute them because they are doing the work of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2C</sup> Daniel had exhibited the spirit of Goel in the day of Nebuchadnezzar; and the queen, knowing this, said: “Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.” (Dan. 5:12) This exactly describes the spirit and the work exhibited and done in the Elijah period of the church by those who were made members of the “faithful and wise servant” class upon the coming of the Lord to the temple. The governing powers were taking notice of these faithful men and women and of what they were telling about God’s kingdom during the World War, and were really afraid that there was much truth in what they said, and hence gave ear to the appeals made by the clergy that something should be done against these witnesses. On the other hand, the class of men whom the mother queen foreshadowed, and who are of less importance in governmental affairs, and arc therefore called the “weaker vessels”, take notice that the true followers of Christ Jesus, who were and are the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, had a real message from God. Still holding to that belief'these men, like the queen, recommended Daniel, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses, to the greater ruling element, saying, “Let them be called and heard.” Those who are willing to give Jehovah’s witnesses, the faithful remnant, opportunity to talk believe that if these cannot give a true interpretation of the present distressing world conditions and what the Bible has to say about the same, then no one else can, and certainly the hypocritical clergy have made such a miserable failure in giving explanation that it is time to give opportunity for those to talk who give evidence that they are really sincere and have the spirit of the Lord and know what they are talking about. Jehovah had arranged this matter and was now causing a picture to be made and a record thereof to be kept for the aid and comfort of the faithful remnant now on the earth. This fact gives much consolation to Jehovah’s witnesses, and with eagerness they continue to seek a better understanding of the prophecy, particularly with reference to the meaning of the calling of Daniel before the king and what relation that has to the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in the present day.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CHRISTIANS PERSECUTED: WHY PERMITTED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">P</span><span class="font3">ERSECUTION and sufferings are not to be desired by anyone. Everyone would rather dwell in peace and in happiness. Jesus and his true followers have been persecuted because or their loyalty and faithfulness to God. This being true, and God being all-powerful and the very expression of love, why would he permit hi.s beloved Son and his faithful followers to suffer persecution at the hands of the Devil and his representatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The answer is that God has not interfered with Satan's pursuing his course of willful wickedness; he has permitted him to demonstrate his malignant disposition, and to reproach God and reproach everyone who has been faithful to God, because these persecutions would furnish the opportunities for the Lord Jesus and his faithful followers to prove their loyalty and faithfulness unto Jehovah and to prove the same under the most adverse circumstances, and thereby demonstrate to all creation that God can put men on this earth who can and will maintain their integrity toward God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Jesus it is written: “Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered np prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were aSon, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.’’— Heb. 5: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If a man prefers bodily ease and comfort and peace rather than the approval of God, then he will put himself in a condition to not be persecuted; and this he may do by proving disloyal and unfaithful to God. But he who would willingly suffer the most ignominious death in order to maintain his loyalty and faithfulness to God can be for ever trusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Jesus it is written: “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glorv of God the Father.’’— Phil. 2:8-11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus did the Foundation Stone, the Chief Corner Stone, become a tried and proved Stone, as the prophet Isaiah (28:16) had foretold in these words: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.” Before God granted unto the Lord Jesus the exalted reward of being the head of the great empire or kingdom of God which is to rule the earth, he put him to the most crucial test. Those who will be approved of God and become a part of the empire must follow in the footsteps of Jesus, which includes their suffering for doing right. “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.”— 1 Pet. 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why do true Christians suffer? Because God her, ehosen them out of the world and because they refuse to show allegiance unto the Devil’s organization, Jes-.s said concerning his followers: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have ehosen you out of tr,e world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that 1 said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”—John 15:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the World War, from the year 191-1 to 191 t, humble Christians residing in Germany were subjected to all manner of wicked persecutions and punishment because they declined to disobey God’s command, “Thou shalt not kill.” In England, Canada and America like followers of Jesus Christ were beaten, thrown into prison, tarred and feathered, and some of them were killed, because they refused to take up arms against their fellow man and shed innocent blood. The war furnished an opportunity and an excuse for the clergy who, as the representatives of Satan, hated these humble Christians and who induced the commercial and political powers to unjustly punish Christians. Not all were persecuted because of refusal Io kill; some were persecuted merely because they were witnesses for the Lord. Men too old for war service, and women who were not at all subject to militaiy duty, because they were Christians were hated by the Devil; and his offspring the clergy induced the persecution and imprisonment of such. For a full account of these wicked persecutions see the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Aye</span><span class="font3"> magazine, number twenty-seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently in the towns of Jersey City, Plainfield, Bergenfield, Asbury Park, and Ocean Grove, New Jersey, and in divers places in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, and other places, good men and women while engaged in an effort to do good, and while bringing comfort to the people now in distress, have been ruthlessly arrested, cursed and abused by officers, and otherwise illtreatcd, and thrown into dungeons. These men and women who have been thus arrested and persecuted arc Jehovah's witnesses engaged in the performance of their lawful and rightful duties. They are being thus wrongfully treated because they are the representatives and servants of Jehovah and arc nns-ser.gers of peace concerning his righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All true witnesses for the Lord have been classed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy as bigots, blasphemers and enemies of the state, and the charge of sedition and blasphemy is often laid against the. humble followers of Christ Jesus. Such wicked opposition to the truth, and such persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, are made manifest today, particularly in the countries of Italy, Germany, Canada and the United States, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that persecution is led by the religionists of so-calkd '‘organized Christianity”, the chief instrument of Satan on earth. Many of the brethren throughout Germany have been arrested and thrown into concentration camps, and they have been in great difficulties. We are certain, however, that the Lord has permitted this for a purpose, and Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are not discouraged. They well know that they are engaged in the work of Jehovah and whatsoever is his will is sure to come to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Christian as a witness for Jehovah can bear persecutions for righteousness’ sake without developing a feeling of bitterness against his persecutors. He realizes that God permits it even as he permitted such upon the Lord Jesus, that the loyalty and faithfulness of the Christian may be tested. He relies upon the promises of God ami rejoices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suffering is a part of the training of a Christian to prepare him for the kingdom of God. When he does right and suffers therefor at the hands of the Devil’s representatives, then he may have reason to rejoice. Jesus said: ‘‘Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 5:10) The Christian is aware of the fact that the Devil has reproached God ever since the time that the Devil tempted man in the garden of Eden. It is written concerning the Lord Jesus: ‘‘The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Ps. 69: 9) The Devil reproached the Lord Jesus when he was on earth. The follower of Christ expects the same thing, and the apostle Paul plainly states (Pom. 15:3,4) that these same reproaches which fell upon the Master fall upon the members of his body, ‘‘which is the [true] church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle then goes further and points out that it is a privilege for the Christian thus to suffer with Christ, saying: ‘‘Por unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.” (Phil. 1:29) It is a privilege for the reason that it is a condition precedent to entering into the kingdom. On one occasion the apostle said: ‘‘We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22) Paul emphasizes this when he writes: ‘‘Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” (2 Tim. 3:12) Such is the manner in which the Lord has been pleased to select and give the Christians an opportunity to prove their loving devotion to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One who is willing to endure all manner of persecution, and even death, for righteousness’ sake can be trusted with power and authority. The apostle points out that persecution for righteousness is one of the signs by which we may know that the Lord is dealing with us as followers of Christ Jesus, when he says: ‘‘The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.”—Rom. 8:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This may be followed as a safe rule: When one claims to be a Christian, and then indulges in the persecution of another in the name of Christ, that one is a hypocrite, and not a Christian. The Lord Jems did not revile, even when he was reviled. (1 Pet. 2: 23) The course of persecution and reviling, pursued by t ne. ecclesiastical systems, is therefore proof that they are of their father the Devil and his will they will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The true Christian does not think it strange concerning the fiery trials that come to him because of his faithful devotion to the Lord and his cause of righteousness. He ivlies upon the inspired testimony concerning persecutions, as given by the apostle Peter, to wit: ‘‘Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto yon: but rejoice, inasmuch as je are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may he glad also with ix-ceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy arc ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part lie is glorified.”—1 Pet. 4:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus was finishing his earthly ministry he addressed these faithful disciples who had been with him through his trials, and said: “Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations [trials|. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as mj’ Father hath appointed unto me.” (Luke 22:28,29) Thus the Master showed that the empire or kingdom class would be made up of those who arc faithful to God ami faithful to him. It is not expected that there would be a great multitude of these. On the contrary, the blaster said: “Fear not, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">little</span><span class="font3"> flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”— Luke 12:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ecclesiastical hypocrites have made the people believe that billions will be of the kingdom of God. It is safer to follow the words of the Lord and Master, Christ Jesus. In corroboration of what the Master said, the apostle states: “It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us.” (2 Tim. 2:11,12) The Lord Jesus admonished his followers to fear none of these things, and then gave them this assurance: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—Rev. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil’s organization is designated in the prophecies written before Christ and also in The Revelation under the symbol of a “beast”, and in the latter also as an ‘ ‘ image of the beast ’ ’. Those w ho are promised membership in the royal family of heaven are the ones who refuse to give any allegiance whatsoever to the “beast”, the Devil’s organization. It is written: “And I sarv thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them : and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”—Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Paul shows that all the members of the royal line are subjected to the same temptation. (Heb. 2:18) The same temptation which was presented to Eve in the garden of Eden, and to which she yielded and fell, was also presented to ecclesiastics who claimed to represent God; and to this temptation these ecclesiastical systems likewise yielded and fell. A like temptation was presented to the Lord Jesus, but he resisted it and won. All the members of the body of the royal family of Jehovah God are subjected to the same temptation. Only the overcomers are granted membership in the kingdom. ‘Overcoming’ means gaining the victory over Satan’s organization by an absolute refusal to render allegiance to any part of it, and, on the contrary, to manifest loyalty and faithfulness unto God unto the end. To such overcomers these promises are made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.” (Rev. 3:12) ‘‘To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my' throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (Rev. 3:21) ‘‘And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.” (Rev. 2:26,27) These are all promises by the Lord Jesus addressed to his faithful followers particularly down at this end of the age, and Jehovah God will make good every one of these promises to the faithful, for the vindication of his glorious name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutiukfoiid:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We received the jihonograph and records a few days ago, and to say we were glad to got them would be putting it mildly; for we were real happy, and so glad to let someone hear the message who couldn’t read any language that we played it to some Spanish people, who had twelve children and all raised Catholic. .So I put on the record ‘ ‘ Purgatory ’ and when I played it their eyes brightened up and sanctioned every word spoken. So they gave us every penny they had, which was a fiye-eenl piece, for one of the booklets, and said that one of the children could read English. And so I played to one old man in. another place, all by himself, and he took four bound books. And so on down the line: we played the records, or, I might suy, gave the message from Jehovah through you, Brother Rutherford. I am so glad that Jehovah has made those provisions for us pioneers, that we can continue in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The people around here, as elsewhere, have no money, and very little to trade. But when one is real hungry for the truth and can’t contribute anything, we never lot him go hungry: we donate something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now we don’t only thank you for the phonograph, but thank you for all past favors in books and your encouragement in the service, and would have written before, but know you are a busy man in the Master’s service, and we didn’t want to take any of your time, thinking you took it for granted, as we are trying our best to exist and be in the Master’s service as much as we can. We have a family of four children, and must care for them also, but try to make the Master’s service first ami most important.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This is an expression of thanks to Jehovah, who, through you and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, has made it possible for a continued increase of service and a real opportunity to preach the glad tidings of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneer work, which affords daily the privilege of cartying the message from door to door, and now the phonograph and records, which are the hist word in efficiency in spreading the message rapidly, are proof of the guiding hand of tho present King, and an inspiration to renewed energy and zeal in temple service, to scatter the coals of the over the city. The urge within me calls for an expression of one or two of the</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>TERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">many incidents where the phonograph did a work which otherwise would hare been impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a sawmill town in my territory, four &quot;Holiness” preachers were holding an open air meeting on Main street. A woman living next door to tho vacant lot where tho meeting was held gladly consented for us to play the records one evening as the meeting was going on. We. set up tho phonograph on a little table on the sidewalk in front of her house, not over one hundred feet from the platform where these four preachers were using the Indian snake dance and the incantations of the African medicine man to charm an audience of at least two hundred people, all the while blaspheming the Lord by clapping of hands and shouting, &quot;Braise you Jesus! Braise you Jesus!” It was enough to turn the stomach of any honest person. We put on the record </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Jehovah”,</span><span class="font2"> and let it hurl the truth into their midst. It being a clear, cool night, your voice carried well into the midst of the crowd in spite of the noise. All at once it became so still you could hoar a pin drop. All that was heard was your voice declaring who Jehovah is and what constitutes real service to him. All must have hoard it plainly, even the four preachers. Suddenly, one of them, realizing what was going on, jumped about four feet into tho air, landed on the platform, clapping his hands and shouting, &quot;Praise you Jesus!”, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We played one record after another, and gradually people began to eomc from the crowd to hear the lectures. Some would come and liiten a while, and then go back. Finally a littlo man with a long flashlight came over and listened intently for a short time, then went back. A few minutes later he came over again and held his flashlight for me, while I explained the picture representing the &quot;beast” and his number, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> One. I made it plain about how the preacheis and politicians are working with big business. Ho took it all in, then he went back to the other meetings. The next day wo were informed that be was the city marshal, and hail been sent over to stop the phonograph from playing. But lie made no attempt to do so. We also learned that some of the crowd intended to come over and &quot;stamp the phonograph into hell”, as they put it. But nothing was done. Tho woman who gave us permission to play in front of her house surely enjoyed the lectures. Not being able to read, naturally she got a lot from hearing them. The next day some of the &quot;Holiness” people ordered her to leave town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We continued to play the records until the nmeting closed; then we closed, too. In the meantime thirty-eight people camo over to hear the phonograph play. The best of all is this: The very night aft-r they closed their meeting tl.e lour preachers fell out with each other because one wanted to preach one doctrine, and another a different doctiine. Not being able to agree, three of them left town in a big huff, one remaining, who said he was going to stay in the town until the Devil was run out. Three nights later the meeting died, with only fifteen present and no collection. Babylon is fallen, is fallen! So your voice over the phonograph, declaring who Jehovah God is, bis purposes, and how to truly serve him, was too much tor the worshipers of Baal. The truth put them into confusion, ami they 11 ‘d I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One other incident: On a Sunday morning, by previous announcement, we held a lecture at a country schoolhouse, following Sunday school. The preacher was there to lead the Sunday school. Gradually a erowd of sixty-seven gathered, only about a dozen of which, as admitted by the preacher, came to Sunday school, the rest coming to hear the lectures. When, in the lecture on “Soul”, the remark is made, “Why, in the face of these plain scriptures, the clergy continue to teach the doctrine of immortality of the soul,” etc., the preacher’s eyes popped out so far you could have knocked them off with a stick. He listened intently, and, at the close of the service, announced that the literature was for sale at the door of tho building, and shook my hand, saying, “1 enjojed the lectures very much.” I wonder, did ho really 1</span></p>

It is proving to be a real blessing and inspiration to us ns well as to other hearers. By the grace of God and with his most needed help, and the prayers of the brethren, which we entreat, we hope to continue our feeble efforts to carry this glorious message and say, “Come,” to all who will hear us.</span></p>
