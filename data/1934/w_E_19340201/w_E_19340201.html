<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

At 3: 30 to 4 o’clock p.m. Brother Rutherford will deliver an address which will be broadcast from coast to coast. The convention will conclude on the night of the 28th with celebration of the Memorial. The forenoon of each day of the convention will be used for house-to-house witness work.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC LECTURES BY TRANSCRIPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s blessing has been markedly upon the use of the portable transcription machine. He has plainly manifested that this machine meets the need of the hour, when the enemy, under Gog, is seeking to curtail the use of the radio by God’s anointed and when the people’s ears are eager to hear, not man’s message, but God’s. The transcription machine has increased the power of Jehovah’s witnesses afield to preach llis truth manyfold, so that the desire for the literature is stimulated and study classes of many interested hearers are being formed. Besides more than 300 such machines in the United States alone, great numbers are now being effectively used in countries near and afar.

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HOPE OF A TREE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For there iff hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it ill sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof irax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; get through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.”—Job 14:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH is the source of life. That eternal truth all creation who live must learn. All, therefore, must know that Jehovah is the Almighty God, besides whom there is none. It is Jehovah who has placed his own great name upon his beloved Son and made him his Vindicator; and now he says to the peoples of the earth: “In his name shall the nations hope.” Those who come to an appreciation of God’s gracious provision for man are delighted to know that there is no other name given under heaven whereby life can come to the members of the human race save that of his beloved Son, which provision God has made.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has caused his prophecies to be written that men of honest desires may see at this time and discern the purpose of the Most High to give everlasting life to those of the human race who love and serve him. The words recorded in the book of Job above quoted are prophetic and refer to the fall of mankind, and his overlord, and Jehovah’s gracious provision for the recovery of fallen man that he may again live.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">‘ Job was a man of wide experience, and doubtless had walked through the forest where the trees grew by the water’s edge. The cedar tree is symbolic of a living creation and, being an evergreen, it symbolized that God’s creature, man, may have everlasting life; and this would be true with reference to all creation that live and obey Jehovah. Doubtless Job had observed the peculiarities of the cedar tree, which under certain conditions will produce a new tree out of a dead stump. If so, he saw where the cedar tree once stood and lifted its evergreen arms heavenward, and later its foliage had fallen to the earth, the trunk was cut down and decayed, and only the stump remained, and even it appeared to be entirely dead. The roots of the tree had grown old in the soil of the earth, and there appeared to be nothing remaining that indicated life about the tree. Again when he visited that old stump he saw a tender root had stretched its little arms out to the waters and had drunk deeply of that life-giving and life-sustaining substance, and now a new tree was growing up in the place of the one that lay dead. Year after year he saw that new tree continuing to grow, its branches reaching out and it ever lifting its green arms heavenward in an expression of its gratitude to him who had provided water and had given it life. When the new tree had grown large, probably Job sat under that tree while listening to the song birds in its boughs singing the praises of the Giver of every good and perfect gift. Then the Lord God moved the mind of Job to write, and prophetically he wrote: “For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.” (Job 14:7-9) That prophecy is an expression of Jehovah's purpose to again give life to the obedient ones of the human race, even as he caused the new tree to grow up out of the roots of the old stump. God works in a plain and simple though mysterious way his wondrous acts to perform and to reveal them to those who love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREAT TREE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> On another occasion more than 2,500 years prior to this present day Jehovah caused a man to have a dream which now we arc enabled to see related to the same thing about which Job prophetically wrote concerning the tree. Nebuchadnezzar was then the head of the third world power, hence the king over all the peoples, nations and languages that dwelt upon the earth. God had punished the unfaithful nation of Israel by permitting the king of Babylon to defeat the Israelites at war and to carry away the survivors as captives. Among those captives carried to Babylon was faithful Daniel. This occurred eleven years previous to the final destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonish king. Daniel, who now was in the king's service by the king’s command, was honored by the king, and, doubtless by the Lord’s provision, he was there to perform his divinely appointed part in the prophetic picture which God had him record and which relates to the fall and restoration of the human race.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> On a former occasion Daniel, at the request of Nebuchadnezzar, told him of his peculiar drcam and gave him the interpretation thereof. Nebuchadnezzar for that reason had confidence that Daniel was the servant of the Holy One. (Dan. 2:1-45) Again Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and again the magicians of Babylon had been called and had failed to interpret the dream of the king, and again the king caused Daniel to be brought before him. Then Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel his drcam concerning ‘a great tree’ in these words: “I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches. Nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass [copper], in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.” —Daniel 4:10-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> That dream of Nebuchadnezzar, and which was recorded in the book of Daniel, being a prophecy, must some day have its fulfilment. Since the Scriptures declare that whatsoever things were written aforetime were so written that God’s faithful people might in patience and comfort have hope, and that, this greater enlightenment would come to those at the end of the world, we may be sure that the Lord God, sometime while the remnant is on earth, would give to them an understanding of that prophecy and that such understanding would be had before the day of Armageddon. (Rom. 15:4) Jehovah God brings about the events that fulfil these prophetic visions, and they cannot be understood until his due time to have them understood. It now seems to be Jehovah’s due time to permit his people on earth to have an understanding of the prophetic dream concerning the “tree in the midst of the earth”, as recorded in the fourth chapter of Daniel’s prophecy. The understanding of this has come only at God’s appointed time and gives consolation to those who love him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROCLAMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> The fourth chapter of Daniel’s prophecy opens with a proclamation which appears to be made by the king of Babylon. That proclamation was made and published after Nebuchadnezzar had gone through the humiliating experience of the “seven times”, as stated in the prophecy, and after the king had been fully restored to his right mind and was again upon his throne. That proclamation foretold and foreshadowed another far more important proclamation to be made and issued by earth’s rightful King. The vision or dream fulfilled makes known that the ‘seven times of the Gentiles’ had ended and that no longer will Satan be permitted to exercise unhindered the overlordship of man. It discloses the further and more important fact that Jehovah’s kingdom has come and that he has placed his beloved Son upon his holy hill in Zion, that the Son is sent forth to rule in the midst of his enemies, and that the time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The proclamation opens thus: “Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.” (Dan. 4:1) Nebuchadnezzar here pictures Christ Jesus enthroned in 1914, which is the end of the Gentile times, and his work that follows, particularly from the time of his coming to the temple of Jehovah. The name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nebuchadnezzar </span><span class="font3">means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Nebo</span><span class="font3"> (that is, The Prophet) is the protector against misfortune”. The name properly applies to Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great Prophet, and the one who is the protector of God’s people against their foes. It is to Jehovah’s faithful remnant that the Lord has committed “the testimony of Jesus Christ”, and for this reason Satan goes forth making war against them; and Satan would succeed in this warfare were it not for the fact that the Greater Nebo, Christ Jesus, shields and protects them. The time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and those who will have a part with Christ Jesus in that blessed work must suffer at the hands of Satan and his agents; but, now being with Christ in the temple, they have an assurance of his protection and complete deliverance from the enemy’s assaults.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The proclamation says </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.),</span><span class="font3"> “Unto all the peoples, nations, and languages,” and corresponds exactly to the command of Christ Jesus upon coming to God’s temple, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) “And the gospel must first be published among all nations.” (Mark 13:10) It is the time when the peoples of the earth must be told that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that the time has come for his judgment to be executed by his mighty right Arm, and that all who would live must worship him who is the Giver of life. “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”—Rev. 14: 6,7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">• Christ Jesus, the great Prophet and King, addresses his proclamation to “all peoples”, which means primarily to those peoples on the earth who as his followers are maintaining their integrity towards </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Je</span><span class="font3">hovah, and secondarily to the Jonadab class, meaning all those of good will who desire to know and to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do the </span><span class="font3">will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font3">Almighty God. This includes particularly the “sheep” class who are pleased to do good unto others because they believe and understand </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font3">such others are servants of the Almighty God and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">beloved Son. Here then are shown also the faithful followers of Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s witnesses bring</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font3">the message of the proclamation to all others </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font3">have a hearing ear. These are messengers of peace and, quoting the language of their Lord, say: “Peace </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">multiplied unto you.” So said the proclamation </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Nebuchadnezzar the king.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The entire world is now in turmoil and distress </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">has nothing in which it can hope so far as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">world’s schemes are concerned; but to those who </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font3">sire to know God and his King the information </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">now given that “in his name shall the nations hope”. As Jonadab was brought into close contact with Jehu, so now the “sheep” class is brought into close contact with the bearers of this divine message of peace. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Con</span><span class="font3">cerning this message and its messengers it is written: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God rcigneth!” (Isa. 52:7) In order for the Jonadab class to hear, someone must tell them of the King’s proclamation; and this privilege is assigned to the faithful remnant. —Rom. 10:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> It is certain that the Lord God gives an under</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">standing </span><span class="font3">of this prophecy and other prophecies at </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font3">time for the very purpose of giving assurance to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">remnant, that they may have a strong hope of entering into eternal glory and secure the prize, the crown </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">life. Without such assurance the remnant would </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font3">come discouraged by reason of the constant persecution suffered by them; but now they see that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">such </span><span class="font3">opposition bi’ings upon them suffering and contradiction and this is essential for them that they may </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font3">opportunity to prove their integrity towards Jehovah and to have a part in the vindication of his name. This assurance increases their faith and hope, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">aud </span><span class="font3">hence onward they march, holding high the standard </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the Lord God, proclaiming his message to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">peo</span><span class="font3">ple and informing them that they will find peace only in the name of the Lord God and his King and king</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">dom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Further manifesting the goodness and loving-kindness of himself and his Father the King (Jesus) says: “I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God [Most High] hath wrought toward me.” (Dan. 4:2) Christ Jesus the King </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">elated that the time has come for the vindication </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Jehovah’s name before all creation, and hence he deems it good to make known to his faithful followers the manner of Jehovah’s dealing with creation, and particularly with Christ Jesus himself, since the day of the rebellion in Eden unto the bringing of Christ Jesus to the throne as the Head of Jehovah’s holy organization of Zion. This is further and conclusive proof that Jehovah is the Most High. In 1914 the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font3">wonders or signs began to be made manifest when the mighty organization of Satan met in conflict the still mightier organization under Christ Jesus in the war in heaven that resulted in ousting Satan and his wicked crowd from heaven. Then thereafter it was that the great Vindicator at the temple of Je</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">hovah </span><span class="font3">began to make known to the remnant the ‘two great wonders or signs’ of the twelfth chapter of Revelation and these faithful ones began to discern and appreciate for the first time of and concerning Satan’s organization that is pitted against Jehovah’s organization, and that the final conflict will be had </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font3">Armageddon. It was early in the year 1925 that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> by the grace of the Lord, published the meaning of these two great wonders of Revelation. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> March 1, 1925.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“Priorto the comingofthe Lord Jesus to the temple the faithful ones on earth saw Jesus Christ only as the Redeemer and Savior of man, but now they see him as the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, who has gained that exalted place and has proved his qualifications for that place by reason of the things which he suffered and which things were necessary for him to suffer in order to maintain his integrity and to prove Jehovah’s side of the great question at issue. (Heb. 5:8,9) Now he would have his faithful followers to know the ‘great wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me’, that is, toward the Lord Jesus Christ, the beloved Son of God. Then Christ Jesus, in admiration of and giving expression to his boundless love for his Father, further says: “How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.” (Dan. 4:3) Like as he has always been, he takes not the credit to himself but gives the honor and glory to Jehovah. Among the great and mighty wonders here mentioned are the manifestation of Jehovah’s foreknowledge, his supremacy, and his never-failing purpose. The display of his perfect wisdom and unlimited power causes all pure-hearted creatures to stand in amazement, fear, astonishment and consternation, so mighty are his wondrous works. Those who love God begin to appreciate the words of his prophet that all nations before him are as nothing and are accounted to him as less than nothing, and vanity. (Isa. 40:17) “None can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?” —Dan. 4:35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> The time has come now to settle the issue before all creation that Jehovah is supreme, that he is the King of Ilternity, and the One who shall rule the earth and make it a place of righteousness; and this fact the great Prophet and King, Christ Jesus, will make known to the peoples of earth. Satan and his wicked organization must go, and Jehovah God by his righteous King “shall reign for ever and ever”. (Rev. 11:15) Let the proclamation be sounded throughout all the earth, that Jehovah’s Vindicator will not back down but will march on to victory, continuing to exhibit the mighty works of the Most High God. The first three verses of the fourth chapter of Daniel’s prophecy are therefore a fitting tribute to Jehovah before the announcing of the dream. Since Nebuchadnezzar himself was a servant of Satan, this is further proof that the words of adoration and praise to the Most High God in the opening of the proclamation are prophetic and are in truth and in fact the words of Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REGAL POWER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Nebuchadnezzar was not a type of Christ Jesus, but he was an illustration of regal power in the abstract. Now speaking of himself and his dream the king of ancient Babylon said: “I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace.” (Vs.4) Here he is merely the human Nebuchadnezzar of the history of 2,500 years ago, clothed with power by the permission of Jehovah God to rule over the world and to enforce Jehovah’s decree of punishment against the unfaithful Israelites. In such a capacity he is used by Jehovah as an illustration of regal power in the abstract or impersonally. He is a symltol of power to rule. The time of his dream was approximately eight years before the date of the issuing of the proclamation with which the chapter opens. Doubtless Nebuchadnezzar was at that time in the king’s “palace of the kingdom of Babylon”, as indicated by verse twenty-nine. This background of the picture is appropriate and fitting to show that Nebuchadnezzar was used to illustrate or to picture regal power.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLACE OF THE DREAM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> At the time of his proclamation Nebuchadnezzar relates again the dream which he had eight years previous, and after its miniature fulfilment. “I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.” (Vs. 5) Clearly that drcam was caused and recorded by the power of Jehovah God and was a prophetic expression of his dealing with regal power as exercised both by his adversary and by his servant. Nebuchadnezzar at the time was the earthly head of Satan’s organization; and the dream that troubled Nebuchadnezzar, as he states, illustrates Jehovah’s duly serving notice upon Satan and his organization, which now disturbs their easy complacency and selfassurance. King Nebuchadnezzar at this point, therefore, pictures regal or ruling power as exercised </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">by </span><span class="font3">the rulers of this earth who are a part of Satan’s organization. “Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.” (Vs. 6) The earthly rulers under Satan now consult spirit mediums in their efforts to determine what course they should take; but as the magicians failed to give the answer to Nebuchadnezzar, even so the fallen angels cannot now give good advice to earthly rulers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” All the members and operators of the world organization, not being for God and his kingdom under Christ, are therefore against the kingdom; and this is true regardless of whether they are sincere in their efforts to do good or not. (Matt. 12: 30) “Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the drcam before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.” (Vs. 7) The magicians, astrologers, enchanters and soothsayers here picture the pope, the cardinals, the clergy, the philosophers and other professed wise men of the world who attempt to give counsel and advice to earthly political rulers. As the magicians, enchanters and astrologers were representatives of Satan, so the present worldly wise men above mentioned arc the servants of Satan. These servants of Satan and so-called “wise men” of the world cannot unravel Jehovah’s purpose, even after he sets the same down in his Word. They shun the Word of God and follow the lead of foolish men and wicked angels. They are unrighteous, and for that reason they cannot understand;,as it is written: “His secret is with the righteous.” (Prov, 3:32) Therefore the “wiseacres” of the world now throw up their hands and give up the job in despair. Of them Jehovah’s prophet wrote: “The vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed.”—Isa. 29:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> All the heathen “wise men” having failed to interpret the dream, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Daniel. “But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream.” (Vs. 8) The name given to Daniel by Nebuchadnezzar was Belteshazzar, that is, “Bel’s prince,” that is to say, “Confounder’s prince,” or, “one whom Bel favors”; and this corresponds somewhat with the meaning of the name of Daniel. Nebuchadnezzar had named Daniel “according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods”, thus showing the heathen way of saying that Daniel was favored by the supreme God and moved upon by God's power through “the mighty God”, that is, the Logos, now Christ Jesus. Daniel never confessed that he spoke in the name of Bel, even though he was called by that name. In the account given by Nebuchadnezzar the name of Jehovah does not appear, and this shows that the account is from a pagan ruler and is another evidence of its genuineness. The fact that Nebuchadnezzar had to send for Daniel to interpret his dream shows that he was obliged to apply indirectly to Jehovah for enlightenment. Ue could not get it from his own servants but could receive enlightenment only from the servant of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> The name Daniel means “God’s Judge”. Daniel at this point foreshadows Christ Jesus the great Judge, whom Jehovah has appointed as such and to whom He has ‘committed all judgment, and given him power to execute judgment'. (John 5:22,27) The sending for Daniel corresponds to the time of sending forth Christ Jesus by Jehovah to begin his reign amidst his enemies, and therefore relates to the year 1914. (Ps. 110:2) The worldly “wise men” of Satan’s religious, commercial and political organization had completely failed at that time to solve the mystery concerning the human race, and in 1914 God sent his Son forth to rule and in 1918 installed him as Judge at his temple and gave commandment to the nations that they should hear him. “But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Hab. 2:20) The worldly wise men had an opportunity from that time forward to hear the message from the Lord God, but they gave no heed to it. God’s use of Daniel in giving the interpretation to the dream shows that Jehovah through his chief representative, Christ Jesus, will make known his purpose to his remnant people “upon whom the ends of the world are come”, for the reason that these things were written for their aid, comfort and hope. (1 Cor. 10:11; Rom. 15:4) The day of judgment of the nations having come, the time is due for the Lord to give the interpretation of the prophecy herein considered to those who love and serve him, and for that reason we may confidently look for the interpretation thereof from the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Nebuchadnezzar told the dream before Daniel, and evidently the heathen “wise men” were present, since Nebuchadnezzar addressed Daniel as “master of the magicians”. That language of the king did not signify that Daniel had anything in common with the magicians and soothsayers, but, being superior to them, he did have the mastery over them in interpreting; hence the king addressed Daniel thus: “0 Belte-shazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of mj- dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.” (Vs. 9) Nebuchadnezzar called to mind that the almighty God on a previous occasion had used Daniel to make known and interpret his dream concerning the great image. (Dan. 2:1-45) He had confidence that Daniel, the servant of the great God, could now interpret this dream.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TREE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Nebuchadnezzar was familiar with trees; but the vision of a great tree in the midst of the earth, and which vision came to him in a drcam, made him afraid, and its being recorded in the prophecy of God’s Word shows that the dream was from Jehovah and given to illustrate his purpose toward particularly the creation of earth and its overlord. Nebuchadnezzar then tells the dream and says: “ I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.”—Vss. 10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The tree towering above the earth pictures in the abstract the overlordship of the earth together with the organization of the earth beneath it. It therefore pictured a living creation of Jehovah. When God created man and the other animals of the earth he assigned the overlordship of the earth’s creation to Lucifer. (Ezek. 28:13-15) The position of overlord of man was a very exalted place and is pictured by the great tree towering high above the earth. This overlordship and its organization beneath is shown to apply originally to Lucifer and thereafter Satan, as stated by the prophet Ezekiel, in chapter 31, verses 2 and 3: “Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.” The third verse quoted above, according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font3"> margin, reads: “Lo! a shorbin cedar in Lebanon.” This sherbin cedar pictured Satan and his organization. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font3">Book Two, page 149.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> When Lucifer was appointed by Jehovah to the exalted position of overlord of man he at first exercised that office over only Adam and Eve, so far as the human family was concerned. He then saw the possibility of extending his regal power over many peoples that should spring from Adam and Eve by reason of God’s commandment given to them to “be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it”. (Gen. 1:28) Greed for selfish gain or 'the love for money’ moved Lucifer to commercialize mankind. That was the beginning or the root of all evil. (1 Tim. 6:10) Regal power or overlordship, together with the organization under it, the tree, there began to expand; and so it is written: “The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the siirht thereof to the end of all the earth.” (Vs. 11) That the office of overlordship was a heavenly one is here shown by the fact that the tree “reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth”. This is also pictured in the prophecy of Daniel concerning the great image, the head of which was of gold, representing Satan, while the silver and copper immediately under the head represented the invisible part of Satan’s organization. (Dan. 2:35; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 292-319) The office of overlord, like the lofty top of the cedar tree, dominated everything on earth and was visible from all parts of the earth. That does not mean that Satan was visible, but his power or overlordship was discernible throughout the earth. The overlord supervised all the earth and must be looked up to and recognized by all the earth. In this manner Satan exalted himself over all the earth and made men look up to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> The leaves of a tree are for the benefit of the creatures that come in contact therewith. (Rev. 22:2) Describing the tree in the vision the prophecy reads: “The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.” (Vs. 12) The base or root stock of the tree was in the earth, and thus pictured man, and shows that it is the man whom God created and concerning whom he commanded: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepcth upon the earth.” (Gen. 1: 26) The dominion of man was and is limited to the earth, but above man was the invisible organization, headed or topped by Lucifer, who afterwards became Satan, and to whom the words of Jehovah apply: “Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.” (Dan. 2: 37) This is proof that Nebuchadnezzar represented or illustrated regal power that was granted to Lucifer and which power he abused and turned to wickedness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> The prophetic vision states that the fruit of the tree was much, and that in it was meat for all and all flesh was fed of it. Even after iniquity was found in Lucifer and he became Satan, and since, all the earth has been compelled to feed from that tree. This is corroborated by the Scriptural statement that the whole world lieth in the wicked one. (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> The creation of earth has been under the shadow of that wicked organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCHER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Lucifer, when appointed to the high office of overlordship, was a part of Jehovah’s organization, and hence formed a part of the “higher powers”. Lucifer was made God’s watcher over the interests of the things of the earth, but he became unfaithful, rebellious and unholy and no longer was a watcher. On the contrary, he opposed the interests of Jehovah and the interests of man and has attempted to turn everything to his own wicked use. There was another watcher over and above Lucifer, and this is the one whom Nebuchadnezzar saw in vision. “I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">watcher and an holy one came down from heaven.” (Vs. 13) This one Watcher was watching the tree, and hence he was higher than Lucifer. That one watcher was and ever has been “an holy one” and is the Logos or the Word of God, the only begotten and beloved Son of Jehovah God. This holy Watcher has ever remained fully a d completely devoted to Jehovah God and has always maintained his integrity toward him. ,The vision discloses this watcher coming down from heaven, which manifestly means that the Logos, Jesus, the beloved One and faithful One of Jehovah, turned his attention to the things which pertain to and affect the earth, and particularly man.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DECREE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2T</sup> This holy one, the Watcher, being the spokesman of Jehovah God, makes known the decree of the Most High. “He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches.” (Vs. 14) That decree, means that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">RIGHT</span><span class="font3"> to the overlordship was then and there taken away from Lucifer, now Satan, and that he (Satan) and his spirit subordinates were cut off from Jehovah’s organization and were henceforth outlaws and that no earthly creature was required to remain under Satan’s organization, for the reason that he was no longer any part of the “higher powers” and no more furnishes protection and nourishment and help for mankind. All those who would have the blessings of life must give their allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and his holy Watcher. This divine judgment or decree did not mean that at the time of Adam’s sin and the fall of Lucifer, now Satan, the judgment was to be executed immediately and that Satan and his invisible organization were then cast out of heaven and down to the earth; but that decree declares God’s purpose concerning the same. It is the final judgment then and there made and written against Satan and his organization, which judgment began to be executed at the time when Christ Jesus was sent forth to rule and to cast Satan and his wicked angels out of heaven. The execution of that decree, therefore, began in 1914 and shall be fully and completely executed at Armageddon. The destruction of the tree as described by the prophet Ezekiel, in the thirty-first chapter, shows what will come to pass at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Satan has exercised overlordship in his wicked organization, which includes the human race, even to the present time; but he has exercised that regal power without divine authority and has rebelled against Jehovah God. Jehovah’s purpose was announced in the decree, but that decree he did not execute immediately and completely destroy Satan and his organization but has permitted him to go on in his wicked efforts to prove his side of the challenge flung into the face of Jehovah God. The wisdom and supremacy of Jehovah are here exhibited by proving that he bides his own due time to vindicate his name. Peter refers to this matter of Satan’s wicked organization and its continued operation when he says: “Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.” (1 Pet. 3: 20) The language of the apostle here used docs not mean that Jehovah God suffered bodily pain or mental anguish by reason of the wrongdoing of his creatures. Jehovah God is at all times serene and self-contained. There would be no reason why he should suffer bodily or mentally. The word 'suffer’, as used concerning Jehovah, means that he thus permitted without hindrance the wicked one’s continuing his work. In other words, Satan operated by the sufferance or permission of Jehovah. Alan has been left to exercise his own free will to serve either God or Satan, and almost all of human creation have yielded to Satan and followed him, and to that extent it would seem that Satan had largely succeeded in his boastful challenge. Jehovah in his due time will prove to all creation that lives that he is the only true and almighty God and that he is the Giver and sustainer of everlasting life and that he gives life to those who love and serve and obey him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE STUMP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The divine decree announced by the holy Watcher further discloses Jehovah’s purposes concerning fallen man and his recovery. Never could it be possible for man to have sustenance and life from that old “tree in the midst of the earth”, because such had become wicked and now must be cut down, its leaves shaken eft, and its fruit scattered; but the decree declares that the stump of its roots in the earth must be left. “Nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.” (Vs. 15) The “stump of his roots in the earth” represented or pictured original man, made a part of the organization over which Lucifer was given overlordship. The leaving of the stump signified Jehovah’s purpose to provide an organization or a new tree by and through which obedient mankind might have life everlasting. Such of mankind, however, must meet the conditions imposed by the new tree or holy organization. This hope for man would come, not by reason of his own efforts, but by and through the kingdom of God with Christ Jesus as the Savior and enthroned King and Overlord of earth’s creation. The “band of iron and brass” around the stump shows that a long period of time would elapse before the opportunity for the restoration of obedient man under God’s organization would come and in that period of time man would be under the restraining rule of wicked spirit creatures, which are pictured by the copper or brass, and also under earthly rule of imperfect men, pictured by the iron. This is corroborated by the prophecy of the Great Image showing that wicked spirits and wicked men have ruled the world and that this earthly rule of iron has been and is harsh and selfish and cruel. (See Daniel 2:32,33; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 309.) This entire organization, of course, has been dominated by Satan. Furthermore, this band about the stump shows that such period of time of waiting must continue until God's due time to remove the restraining power of Satan and his organization and that also Christ Jesus must wait until God's due time when he should be sent forth to place the enemy under his feet. (Ps. 110:1, 2 ; Ileb. 10:13) During that period of waiting the stump is in the “grass of the field” and “wet with the dew of heaven”. This shows that while mankind is alienated from God, out in the world with no proper habitation, yet God would not permit the race to perish and become entirely hopeless, but that it should be kept wet with the dew from heaven, that is to say, the refreshing promises which could be laid hold upon by those who love God and righteousness. This is in harmony with the declaration of the Scriptures: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew.” (Dent. 32:2) This refreshing coming from heaven would work beneficially to those of the human race who during that long period of waiting would have and exercise faith in God and his precious promises and who would endeavor to maintain their integrity toward him. The whole race would be restrained and bound in a cruel rule, and those who would have faith in God would receive benefit and hope, illustrated by the dew.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Jehovah caused to be written both the words of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and the prophecy of Job, and both are in exact harmony. The tree in its entirety is symbolic of a living creation or organization of Jehovah both invisible and visible to human eyes. The stump and the root forming a part of the stump picture the visible part of that living creation, which is mankind. Now the human race has grown old in the earth, yet there are some of the roots of that stump that, as Job says, have had a scent of the water, which water is symbolic of Jehovah’s life-giving and life-sustaining truths, and those of humankind who have had faith in Jehovah and his precious promises have reached out for that life-giving and life-sustaining water of truth and have continued to have hope. Some of these creatures have maintained their integrity towards Jehovah God and constitute the basis for a new earthly organization. The faithful men from Abel to the last of the prophets looked for a new heavenly organization, even though they did not understand it: and those faithful men will constitute the base for the new earthly part of the living creation pictured b.v the new tree which grows up and rules the world. (Hcb. 11:13-16) Truly, therefore, according to the prophecy of Job, there is hope of a tree. The stump of the original tree, representing man, and the roots thereof in the earth have waxed old and yet there have been some men in the earth, pictured by the roots, that have scented the truth and reached out for it and have clung to Jehovah and his precious promises, and these have promise and hope of being brought into the new tree.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> This part of the prophetic tree proves that Jehovah would not utterly destroy man, but that in his due time he would bring back into his organization the reconciled ones who would maintain their integrity toward him. The original tree trunk or stock must be for ever cut off from the stump and can never be replaced thereon. Had not God created man on the earth there would have existed no reason for a superhuman overlordship. That overlordship was given to Lucifer, and had Lucifer remained faithful there would have been no occasion for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Because of Lucifer’s rebellion and wickedness his organization must now be for ever destroyed, but the hope of obedient man is in another tree, that is to say, the righteous organization which Jehovah God has provided for those who love and obey him. The prophetic words of Job constitute a promise from Jehovah that he will provide for the redemption and deliverance of man and that he will give to all of his obedient ones life through another.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;A cedar tree is seen growing near the water’s edge. Its trunk is cut off and severed from the earth ; the stump is left in the earth and dies, but some of the tender roots survive and reach out for the water, and these are revived and an entirely new tree grows up and takes in obedient man, and it is more beautiful than the original or first tree. This is exactly in harmony with the facts and the prophecy as they are now observed. A tree is symbolic of a living creation or organization, the slump of which particularly pictures the earthly or visible part of that organization. The human race, by reason of sin and alienation from God, has wasted away and died, and yet through the centuries past there have been some of mankind who have exercised faith in God and in his precious promises and these have been sustained by his waters of truth and have maintained their integrity toward him. From these great truths is there a reason to expect that Jehovah will bring forth a-new tree by and through which the people of the nations of the earth may have the hope of life? If so, what constitutes that new tree? What is the chief purpose of its creation and growth? Is it a tree of hope?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">W</span><span class="font3">HATSOEVER Jehovah does is right. All life and all authority proceed from him. The sacrifices which he required in the law given to his typical people Israel were shadows of tilings to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Psalm 50:5 it is written: “Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.’’ Even though the covenant by sacrifice is abnormal, it is fully in keeping with exact justice and is an expression of complete unselfishness. God’s creature, the perfect man Adam, had sinned and thereby made forefeiture of his right to life. He must die and for ever remain dead unless another, perfect as he was, should take Adam’s place in death. Justice required the forfeiture of the life of Adam. Love provided for the corresponding one for sacrifice. Jehovah arranged a covenant to accomplish that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No creature of heaven or earth could originate that covenant of sacrifice, but Jehovah only, “the purpose of him [Jehovah] who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.” (Eph. 1:11) “For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?” (Rom. 11:34) “Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord [Jehovah], or being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?” (Isa. 40:13,14) No one gave Jehovah instruction, and he took counsel with no one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That covenant by sacrifice and the purpose to make it was secret unto all until God’s due time to reveal it. “Which things the angels desire to look into.” (1 Pet. 1:12) Doubtless this included the Logos, the chief of all angels. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and his covenant to make them know it.” (Ps. 25:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> This text and others strongly support the conclusion that the covenant by sacrifice was not known to any creature in the universe until the time for making it. The covenant is sacred to Jehovah. lie says: “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.”— Ps. 89:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The covenant and its outworking required the service of a high priest to perform the sacrificial duties in the priest’s office. “And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.” (Ileb. 5:4) If no man could take the sacrificial office of priest upon himself, much less could the creature propose the covenant with Jehovah by sacrifice. The proof is therefore conclusive that it was Jehovah alone who originated the covenant by sacrifice and made it known in his own good time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What was the occasion for this extraordinary covenant? Not any desire on the part of God for blood. With him is the fountain of life. (Ps. 36:9) He did not need blood for self-gratification. “If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?” (Ps. 50:12, 13) “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.” —Isa. 1:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The occasion was love and grace exercised by Jehovah. The honor of Jehovah’s name was involved, and love and grace acted with wisdom to provide the need. Life of man is a sacred right or privilege. (Gen. 9:5) Adam violated the sacredness of God-given life. Now Jehovah would afford a sacrificial course to be taken by some one, that the sinner might have that sacred gift of life renewed. Jehovah required no one to sacrifice; therefore the sacrificial arrangement was the outgrowth of love. The sacrifice would be just as much on the part of God as on the part of the other party to the covenant, because God alone provided and arranged for the sacrifice. The entire arrangement must be of God’s own volition and by the voluntary agreement on the part of the other one to the covenant. For this reason the covenant was the only arrangement that could fitly serve the purpose of providing a basis for man’s reconciliation. The liberty and free moral agency of the one sacrificed is not interfered with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In determining where tne covenant by sacrifice was made, the purpose of the covenant may be said to control the conclusion. A perfect man had sinned and lost his right to life. God now would have that right to life purchased by another perfect man. Uis law required a life for a life. (Deut. 19:21) That man with a human life must be the one that should be sacrificed. A spirit creature could not enter into a covenant by sacrifice and redeem a human creature, because that would not be a corresponding price. It is true that the life of the Logos was transferred from the spirit to human, but there is no Scriptural evidence that a covenant by sacrifice was known to the Logos at the time of the transfer. Being fully conformable to Jehovah’s will, he came to earth in harmony with his will, being made a perfect man. He was begotten, not by fallen man, but by the power of Jehovah. When he reached his majority as a man he doubtless knew that he was to do something in connection with man’s recovery to life. Whatsoever the will of his Father might be in that respect or any other, he was ready to do it. This is shown by his use of the words: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will.” (Ps. 40:7,8) Paul fixes the time of the covenant as at the Jordan when the words above quoted were made effective. (Ileb. 10:5-7) There Jesus came into the world as a mature man and must determine whether or not he would be of the world. Prior to that time, although he was the heir, his position was nothing different from that of a servant, because he was under the discipline of the law covenant.—Gal. 4:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When ‘the appointed time of the Father’ arrived there was a feature of God’s will to be carried out which prior to that time was secret to all. At the Jordan, which fixes the time of the consecration of the man Jesus, was the appointed time of the Father. That clearly, therefore, seems to be the proper and due time for the making of the covenant which resulted in the sacrifice of the man Jesus. The unconditional agreement there on the part of Jesus was to do his Father’s will, whatsoever that might be; and if it meant that he must die, he was agreeable to that. The sacrifice was primarily the sacrifice of Jehovah, because it was Jehovah who gave his dearly beloved Son, him who belonged to Jehovah exclusively, to be sacrificed. This was shown in the picture on Mount Moriah when Abraham, representing Jehovah, offered his only son Isaac, who at that time represented Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was the love of God that provided the sacrifice which the sacrifice on Mount Moriah pictured. This is further proved by the words: &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) The irresistible conclusion, therefore, is that the covenant by sacrifice was made on earth, and not in heaven, and that it was made at the Jordan when Jesus consecrated and was baptized. It hardly seems reasonable that Jesus understood prior thereto that he was to be sacrificed. Immediately following his consecration at the Jordan he went into the wilderness to study the divine purpose. There Jesus undoubtedly learned the full meaning and importance of his covenant with his Father. It was in the wilderness that Satan placed before him the great temptations in an effort to induce Jesus to abandon his covenant. At that test Jesus declared in substance that eternal life depends upon full obedience unto God and the faithful performance of his covenant with God. (Matt. 4:4,10) Without doubt the perfect man Jesus continued to study his Father’s purpose and to fully appreciate that his covenant required his death. He said that he came to give his life for men. (Matt. 20:28) Again, he said: “I am that bread of life. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.”— John 6:48,51; 10:11,15,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Jesus was taking this course of action in keeping with the terms of his covenant with his Father is proved by his words: ‘‘No man taketh it [my life] from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.” (John 10:18) When Peter recognized Jesus as the anointed One of God and so stated to him Jesus replied: ‘‘The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the ciders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.” (Luke 9:22) Thus he showed that he understood his covenant was that he should be slain and that he should be raised from the dead. Undoubtedly Jesus understood that his baptism in the waters of the Jordan symbolically represented his death and that his real baptism meant his sacrificial death. ‘‘I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how ami straitened till it be accomplished!”—Luke 12:50.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>JOB’S EXPERIENCES PROPHETIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE sufferings of Job, painful beyond almost any comparison, had a most unusual beginning. Highly interesting is the account of these sufferings which, as the Scriptures show, are deeply significant to the perplexed and weary peoples who live in this day of uncertainty and distress that afflicts the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptural proof is positive that God used the people of Israel to make pictures of the outworking of his purpose of salvation. The law which God gave to the Israelites foreshadowed better things to come to humanity. What came to pass with the Jews was recorded for examples or ensamples for the benefit of those who will learn of the outworking of God’s purpose. Although Job was not a Jew, that would in no wise mean that God did not use him as an example or picture. Job being the greatest man of the east, and seeing that many creatures of heaven and earth were involved, even the great Creator himself, we are warranted in the conclusion that the picture of Job must have even a greater scope than the one in which Israel was involved. If so, then the picture would have to do with all mankind, both Jews and Gentiles. It is deemed advantageous to the student in the examination of the book of Job to state here in general terms what are some of the pictures that plainly appear, and then to show from the Scriptural proof the correctness of that conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job in the day of his prosperity pictured Adam, the perfect and prosperous prince in Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job in his adversity pictured the entire human race suffering loss, sickness and death by reason of sin, which sin the enemy Satan put in operation through Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job suffering the loss of all his children pictures Adam losing all his offspring by reason of sin which was put in operation by Satan the enemy through Adam’s wrongful act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job maintaining his integrity under test pictures a class of men who under test do prove their fidelity and devotion to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job as the servant of God maintaining his fidelity pictured all the servants of God who through adversity steadfastly and immovably hold their faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The three men, Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, who posed as friends of Job, were in fact not his friends. They can better be classed as three frauds. They, therefore, picture the Devil’s agencies, or his organization, attempting to direct man as to what is the course for him to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Elihu, the young man, well pictures or represents God’s anointed messengers who magnify the name of Jehovah and, as God's messengers, speak his message of truth to those who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wife of Job also pictures an instrument that Satan the Devil employs to induce men to curse </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font3">and therefore well represents Satan’s organization passing under the name or symbol of a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job fully restored to health and happiness and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">all and even more than he had in former days pictures the great truth that God in his due time will restore the human race to health, happiness and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One great lesson taught by the book of Job is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font3">of life from the dead by means of resurrection </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">regeneration; also that life, which is the greatest </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">desire </span><span class="font3">of man, may be had only through the office of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a re</span><span class="font3">deemer and mediator whom God provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The presumption is here indulged that all students will carefully study the Scriptural record designated </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">the Bible as the book of Job. Reference to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">text </span><span class="font3">is made here, but a proper consideration cannot </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">given thereto by anyone without a careful studying </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> the texts of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the very beginning of the experience of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">man the </span><span class="font3">controversy was between the great Creator </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">his son Lucifer concerning man. The record shows </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font3">Lucifer was one of the “morning stars” who, being informed of God’s purpose to create the earth and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">creature man for the earth, joined in a song of praise to Jehovah. Man was created and placed in Eden and was put there under the supervision of Lucifer </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font3">Jehovah’s appointment. Lucifer knew that it was </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">duty and privilege of man to worship his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Creator. </span><span class="font3">Lucifer selfishly desired and coveted the worship </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">man for himself. He rebelled against God and led </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font3">to his downfall. Then his name was changed to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sa</span><span class="font3">tan, which means adversary of God. Ever thereafter Satan has striven to turn man against God that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">he, </span><span class="font3">Satan, might have the worship of man and hold </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font3">in subjection to him. This great fact should </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">always </span><span class="font3">be kept in mind in examining the Scriptures, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">particularly the book of Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time of the assembly of the sons of God to present themselves to the great Creator, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">mentioned </span><span class="font3">in the record under consideration, almost all men </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font3">earth had turned to evil by yielding to the wicked influence of Satan. God had not removed from </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sa</span><span class="font3">tan the lordship of earth, but permitted him to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">con</span><span class="font3">tinue to exercise his power over man, and thereby afforded a full opportunity for the testing of all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">creatures. It must have been with much arrogance that Satan appeared in the presence of God, boasting and proud of the fact that he had turned almost </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font3">men away from God the great Creator. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah </span><span class="font3">called upon Satan to report his own movements, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">the response of the adversary was that he had been about the earth. While the record is silent upon </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">point, it is reasonable to conclude that by his very arrogance in the presence of God, Satan declared, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">substance, that no man would willingly continue to serve God, and in fact would not serve him at all, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">un</span><span class="font3">less there were some selfish reason therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What, then, was the issue in the controversy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font3">that time? Doubtless it was this: Will man maintain his integrity before Jehovah? Can God place a man on earth who will be faithful and true to him? Satan would insist that no man would do so, but that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">all, under </span><span class="font3">certain conditions, would turn against God. Manifestly it was the purpose of God to demonstrate that man, by the grace of God, and acting under his counsel, can maintain his integrity and, by meeting the divine requirements and being obedient to God’s provided way, obtain life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To determine the issue God would therefore permit Satan to go to the full limit in his attempt to turn all men against the Lord, and then in his own due time and good way God would demonstrate his own absolute supremacy. Thereby he would teach all creation the all-important lesson that Jehovah is the only </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">true God </span><span class="font3">and there is none besides him. At this point in the controversy Job pictured a class of men who </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font3">maintain a perfect condition of heart and hold the confidence of Jehovah. Therefore at the proper occasion Jehovah offered Satan the opportunity to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font3">his worst. “And the Lord said unto Satan, Ilast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?”—Job 1: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan denied that Job really loved God. He accused God of so hedging Job about that Satan did not have an opportunity to put him to the test. “Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land: but put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.”—Job 1:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was a challenge to Jehovah; and the Lord did not permit the challenge to pass, but told Satan that he might take what Job had. Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and devised ways and means for the destruction of Job’s property and family and carried out his wicked purpose. When he had thus brought great disaster upon Job’s household, he failed because Job still trusted in God and worshiped him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At a subsequent meeting of the sons of God to present themselves to Jehovah, Satan being there also, God reminded Satan that Job still “holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause”. With arrogance and cruel sarcasm Satan replied to the Lord: ‘A man will give his skin for his skin, but all that man hath will he give for his life.’ “But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.” (Job 2:4,5) Again the test was on: “And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils, from the sole of his foot unto his crown.” —Job 2:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Notwithstanding this terrible calamity Job humbled himself before God, as shown by the fact of his sitting down in the ashes. Again Satan had failed to turn Job against the Creator. Satan must have been somewhat disturbed at this turn of affairs. Then he bethought himself of how he had reached Adam through his wife. He injected the thought into the mind of Job’s wife and induced her to make an effort to influence Job to forsake God; and she, acting as Satan’s instrument, called upon Job to forsake God, renounce him, and suffer the consequences. But Job did not yield to the evil devices of his wife. Turning upon her, he rebuked her and said: ‘ ‘ Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” Again Satan had failed in his attempt to turn Job against the Lord. In this experience Job must have pictured that small number of men who throughout the ages have withstood all manner of persecution and have still maintained their faith and devotion to the Lord God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM JEWELS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since I have had a knowledge of the great truths which the Lord has provided for his servant through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">there have been many times I have offered a prayer of thanksgiving to Jehovah for his bountiful provision for his faithful ones. And now the remnant have been given the new joy of the kingdom in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As each part appeared in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> it became apparent that these gems of truth were the most brilliant that the anointed have yet received. In fact, these truths appear as jewels which have now been placed in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation </span><span class="font2">and carefully set by a Master Workman, as shown by your letter to the faithful, and the Preface. This setting adds much to the brilliance of these gems of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am indeed grateful to you, Brother Rutherford, and all the coworkers for these truths which have been provided by Jehovah through you at this time of preparation for Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother in His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">F. K. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Southworth, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kansas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">KNEW THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutheevoru:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May I take a moment of your valuable time to tell you of an incident that came to me a few days ago while in the house-to-house work, and proving the radio is doing a wonderful work? This day out in service I came to a neat colored home, found the man, his wife, and aged mother of seventy years enjoying the Watchtower program. The mother cannot read or write, but she knew the truth. She has learned it from your voice over the radio. She told me that every Sunday when ii was time for you to come on she sat close to the radio to batch each word; and that the message was so sweet, so beautiful, so wonderful, that the tears flowed freely; and that she longs for the kingdom you tell about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I asked her if she ever heard the ministers of the various churches that come over the air. She said, “Yes, yes. I sometimes hear one that comes after the judge; but, honey, he can't talk like the judge. Judge Rutherford is learned of God and has godly wisdom; the other man is learned of the world and has worldly wisdom.” The other man is the pastor of one of the largest and richest churches here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I thought the old colored woman had a unique way of telling the truth. ‘The other man is not learned of God,’ not in his temple, has not a seat at his table to partake of the wonderful food provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The November 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is “meat in due season”. A man told me Sunday, when out in the service, to ‘ get out before he killed me'. It is my desire to be faithful to the end. God bless and keep you, dear brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your sister by His grace,</span></p>
