<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH had Daniel in Babylon to bear testimony to II is name. Daniel stood out separate and distinct from all men of Babylon. Jehovah has taken out from the world (which is antitypieal Babylon) men and women whom he has anointed and appointed to be his witnesses, and these must stand out separate and distinct from all men of the world. It is the name of Jehovah God that is involved, and the vindication of his name was the paramount issue in Daniel’s day. That is still the paramount issue, and which issue must now be definitely settled in the right way. Men are of little importance, but the name of Jehovah is all-important; hence all divine prophecy should be examined with this thought in mind: that the principal reason for these prophetic pictures and the fulfilment thereof is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and what men have to do therewith and what is the result to men arc of secondary importance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Daniel had been in Babylon for several years, and in that time had proved himself a faithful and true witness to the name of God. He was of good old age, and still the Lord God would use him to bear testimony. I’’or approximately 1,900 years God has been taking out from the world his church and using those thus selected to be his witnesses, and now, even in the old age of the church, in these last days the faithful arc having greater opportunities of bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name. The picture made in connection with the appearing of Daniel before the king of Babylon strongly indicates that the remnant would in these last days be given a greater privilege and responsibility to be witnesses to the name of the Most High and to bear before rulers of this world testimony to Jehovah’s name and to his kingdom. The mother queen had concluded her speech before his royal majesty, and the king, giving heed thereto, had Daniel brought before him. “Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the childien of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry ?” (Dan. 5:13) The bringing of Daniel before the king was a last resort of Belshazzar, and after his wise men had utterly failed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The so-called “wise men” of the present day, including the “brain trust”, have utterly failed to suggest a method that will effectually bring peace and prosperity to the people. The prophecy indicates that the remnant of the church yet on earth must as a last resort serve notice and warning of such utter failure upon the earthly rulers of Satan’s organization called Babylon and that this notice must be served shortly preceding the overthrow of the wicked organization by Jehovah’s great Executive Olliccr. Jehovah has brought forth his witnesses for the purpose of giving such notice. The miserable failure of the clergy to tell the truth to the people makes it necessary for Jehovah God to employ the remnant to give notice and warning to the rulers of the world. It was in 1925 that God revealed to his people on earth the meaning of the two great signs or wonders appearing in heaven. (Rev. 12:1,3) Those great signs or venders disclose to God’s people the organization of the enemy Satan, and the greater organization of Jehovah God, the explanation of which appears in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1925, page 67 on. On September 27, 1930, the books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> explaining The Revelation, including the two great signs and wondersand the seven last plagues, were released to the public, and a wide distribution of these books followed, and which were placed in the hands of many of the ruling class. Thereafter the importance of giving testimony was emphasized, and God’s organization on earth fixed a quota for the year 1931 of the amount of literature that it was hoped would be placed; and during each year from that time forward a like course has been taken and a greater testimony than ever given to the name of the Lord. It then became apparent that such is “the testimony of Jesus Christ”, and the remnant understood more fully than before that the Lord has committed to his anointed ones on earth the obligation of delivering this testimony and that they must deliver it regardless of all opposition. The remnant are the witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> No longer, therefore, could the faithful remnant be identified as merely “Bible Students”; because anyone claiming faith in God, and accepting the Bible as his Word, might be  thus designated. When Daniel appeared before Belshazzar the king inquired of him : ‘Arc you Daniel of Jewry?’ That question required Daniel to identify himself as a Jew, that is, one of the people of Jehovah God who gives praise to Jehovah’s name and who was at that time in Satan’s world, Babylon, but who was not a part thereof. Corresponding to this, in the year 1931, Jehovah caused his faithful people to come up before the rulers of the world and to, boldly confess their identity, that is, that they arc those who give praise and service to Jehovah God and therefore arc true Judeans. This does not at all mean that they have any relation whatsoever with the so-called commercial “Jews” or selfish Yiddish people who make gold their god; but it does mean that these oi the remnant are entirely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom. The faithful remnant representatively in a body accepted the gracious gift </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Jehovah God, to wit, the new name given to them by Jehovah, and adopted that new name which he had revealed to them, that is to say, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s xcitnesscs, </span><span class="font3">and from that time forward they have been known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”. In the resolution adopted at that time, to wit, July 26, 1931, reference was made to the period of the work of the church foreshadowed by the prophet Elijah and the names by which the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus had been known during that period, and then the resolution said: “We arc servants of Jehovah God, commissioned to do a work in his name, and, in obedience to his commandment, to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known to the people that Jehovah is the true </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">almighty God; therefore we joyfully embrace and take the name which the mouth of the Lord God has named, and we desire to be known as and called by the name, to wit, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses.” (The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">1931, page 279, paragraph 5) Since then the anointed have been known as and called “Jehovah’s witnesses”, meaning Judeans in fact, that is, those who are wholly devoted to the praise and service of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">333</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">* Belshazzar, after having Daniel identify himself, then said: “I hate even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light, and understanding, and excellent wisdom, is found in thee.” (Dan. 5:14) It is certain that he had not heard of Daniel from his wise men, because they would consider it best to keep Daniel’s name in the dark. Likewise the -world rulers have had no favorable report from the modern clergymen and their “wise” associates about Jehovah’s witnesses, because such “wise men” prefer to have Jehovah’s witnesses entirely discredited. Whatever report is made about them is adverse. The clergy and their allies go even to the point of preventing the people from hearing the testimony delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses; and in this they are ablv supported by Big Business, who own many radio facilities, and who deliberately prevent Jehovah's witnesses from using the radio to proclaim God’s message of truth. It was the queen mother who brought the information to Belshazzar, and it is the honest and fair-minded men of the world today, foreshadowed by the que&lt; n, that bring testimony to the higher rulers concerning the witnesses of Jehovah; and these honest men have had to do with opening the way for Jehovah's witnesses to be heard before the higher governmental officials, recently at Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The prophecy of The Revelation, among other things, says: “And I beheld, and heard an angel Hy</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font3">through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth, by reason of the oilier voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!” (Rev. 8:13) Woes were pronounced by the. Lord in his message delivered and proclaimed at London in 1926 ; Toronto in 1927; Detroit in 1928; and the clergy had b-en unable to explain to their coconspirators the meaning of those woes. When Belshazzar had Daniel before .him, continuing to address Daniel he said: “And now the wise mon, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing.” (Dan. 5:15) The king acknowledged the utter inability of his wise men to make known the interpretation of the handwriting on the wall. Their failure v.as due to the fact that such wise men were the sons of the Devil and his servants, and they could not tell the truth, and hence they lied. (John 8:44) Likewise, ■when the “woes” were pronounced, as above stated, and which corresponded to the three woes shown by the handwriting on the wall in Belshazzar’s least room, the clergy or “wise men” of modern Babylon lied to the other rulers and insisted that what the “pestiferous Bible Students named Jehovah’s witnesses” called ‘signs from Jehovah God’ were not from God at all, but that these men and women who were going about promulgating a message which they claim to be God's message concerning his great signs and wonders are in fact impostors. These clergynun have gone to the point of saying that Jehovah's witnesses are seditionists, pacifists, unpatriotic, against the government, socialists and communists, uncompromising foes of Christianity, hawkers, peddlers, and many other like names. Therefore they have insisted before the higher rulers that no credence should be given to the ‘prattle’ of these witnesses. But the clergy, or modern “wise men”, have not been able to allay the fears of the higher rulers, nor have these lying servants of .Satan been able to keep the real and true interpretation of present-day events from getting to the ears of the ruling class, ami especially 'to those of the ruling class who have a desire to see fair play. The message of the kingdom and the vengeance of our God against Satan's organization, in printed form, has gone into the hands of the .rulers of “Christendom” and has been widely broadcast by radio throughout the land. The rulers Cue bron served with notice and warning, as contained in God's message of the truth, and have been plainly told what they may expect to come upon the world organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> If Belshazzar had been satisfied with the answers given to him by his wise men he would not have continued to be in great trouble as the Scriptures declare he was. He hoped to get some satisfactory answer from Daniel, and therefore said to him: “And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now, if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.” (Dan. 5:16) The opinion of man, unsupported by authoritative proof, only tends to raise doubts in the minds of thoughtful men. Belshazzar was in much doubt as to what he had heard from his wise men, and now he wanted to be informed of the truth. Today the clergymen boastfully express their opinion concerning the present-day events, but their opinions thus expressed are not supported by any real authority and carry no conviction to thoughtful men. The word of God used by Jehovah’s witnesses, the remnant, is not the message of any man, nor the expressed opinion of man, but is the authoritative truth of God’s Word, and does away with all doubt as to the final solution of the world situation. Those w'ho believe and rely upon God’s Word know what is coming to pass shortly; and when they speak thereof they speak with authority from the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Daniel was told that if he could give an honest and satisfactory explanation and interpretation of the handwriting on the wall he would receive great honor and distinction in the realm of the king. But Daniel was not before the king for selfish gain; and this is shown by his answer to the king, to wit: ‘ ‘ Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.” (Dan. 5:17) In presenting Jehovah’s message before the rulers of the earth at this present time, and announcing his judgments against Satan’s organization, Jehovah’s witnesses are not doing so for selfish gain. They are not asking, nor are they expecting, to receive any favor from worldly source. Let the rulers of this world favor their own; which they will do, of course. This is made manifest on every occasion when the questions concerning the truth, are presented before the rulers by Jehovah’s witnesses. Recently a petition was presented to the Congress of the United States relative to the use of the radio, which petition was signed by many persons of good will. Some persons have foolishly said that the presentation of such petition was ‘going to Egypt’, that is, to the world, for help. That conclusion was not only foolish, but very erroneous. The petition asked for no favor from anyone, but does demand that the rights of God’s people be respected and that they be permitted to go on with their work without let or hindrance from any part of the Devil’s representatives or organization. The occasion of this petition was similar to what God directed Moses and Aaron to do in Egypt when appearing before Pharaoh. Such is a witness against the world powers and to the name of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Those whom Daniel foreshadowed at this point, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, began to give answer before “the king”, that is to say, the ruling powers of the world, particularly from July 26, 1931, and forward, and to do so in an effective manner by serving upon them the message contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font3">booklet, the distribution of which began on the fourteenth day of September, 1931, and was world-wide. The clergy were first served with that booklet, and then their allies, the political and financial element. Now modern Babylon’s “wise men” cannot truthfully charge Jehovah’s witnesses as being peddlers and hawkers engaged in a commercial enterprise, particularly with reference to the foregoing booklet, because that was given to them, and many of the clergy viciously tore the booklet to pieces and used abusive language against those who brought it to them. Jehovah’s witnesses are not peddlers and hawkers in delivering any part of Jehovah’s message, and the clergy know that when they charge them with such their charges are wholly false. Jehovah’s witnesses are doing their work in obedience to the command given to them. When before the king Daniel appreciated the fact that Jehovah had ‘raised him up for that very time’, and hence he took advantage of the occasion to make known the judgments of Jehovah God; and this he did unselfishly and without fear, favor, or hope or promise of reward.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> In this day only Jehovah’s witnesses identify “the higher powers” properly. They know and publicly declare that the “higher powers” consist of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. They point to the supremacy of Jehovah, and prove their contention by the historical facts as well as the inspired Word of God. Anyone who holds that a man or company of men or any organization on earth constitutes any part of the “higher powers” mentioned by the apostle in Romans 13:1 shows that he does not understand and does not appreciate God’s Word. The faithful anointed remnant well know that Jehovah is supreme and that his Chief Executive Officer at the temple is directing the work of God’s organization on earth, and that no man is entitled to credit or honor therefor. As did Daniel, so do they give all honor, credit and praise to the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> In a few words Daniel covered much of the history of man from the time of Eden onward: “ 0 thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour.” (Dan. 5:18) Nebuchadnezzar here mentioned represented Lucifer, to whom was given the overlordship of the earth prior to his rebellion in Eden. It was to Lucifer that God committed the rulership of the world; and becoming wicked, he was thenceforth known as &quot;that old serpent”, &quot;the devil,” ‘the father of lies,’ and his offspring are designated the ‘seed of the Serpent’, and which seed of the Serpent was represented by Belshazzar and his Jords and wise men and others of his official organization. After the rebellion </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Satan Jehovah gave nothing to Satan nor to his seed; hence verse eighteen, above quoted, applies specifically prior to the rebellion in Eden. On a previous occasion Daniel had said to Nebuchadnezzar: &quot;It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong [like a great tree in the midst of the earth] : for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.” (Dan. 4:22) Daniel had also stated to Nebuchadnezzar: &quot;Thou, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font3">king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven, hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art tiiis head of gold.” (Dan. 2;37,38) Thus Daniel had spoken of Lucifer as he had appeared at the beginning and before the rebellion. Lucifer, now Satan, turned his organization into wickedness, and at the point of the prophecy concerning the feast of Belshazzar the king Belshazzar there represented the ‘seed of the Serpent’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Lucifer had been entrusted with the power of death, which power, of eour.se, was to bo used in harmony with the will of God and against those willfully disobeying God. (Heb. 2:14) Lucifer did not use his power as authorized ; likewise his representative Nebuchadnezzar improperly used his authority: &quot;And, for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive, and whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down.” (Dan. 5:19) Satan was never authorized to use his power tyrannically; nor has any man been authorized to be a tyrant. Now there are many who tremble before the debased Lucifer, who is Satan, and which people are, because of fear, Devil worshipers. Jehovah's servants do not tremble before the Devil, but they fear and worship Jehovah God. God does not permit the Devil to do as he would against men who are faithful to Jehovah; and this is shown by the experiences of Job. (Job 1:12; 2:4-6; John 19:10,11) Satan has used his power autocratically and despotically in his attempt to be like the Most High and to turn people away from Jehovah. It is true that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem; but he did so only by permission of Jehovah and as an instrument employed by Jehovah to accomplish His purpose in executing His righteous judgment against a rebellious people. (Jer. 25:8,9) Pride with prosperity always leads to disaster. That was true in Nebuchadnezzar’s case. Hence said Daniel concerning him: &quot;But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride [and his spirit was hardened that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font3">dealt proudly, R.V.], he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.” (Dan. 5:20) Nebuchadnezzar continued in his selfish and proud schemes for such a long time that he concluded that he was master of his own destiny and that his actions were not subject to Jehovah’s permission or disapproval. That was exactly the spirit of Lucifer, and which led to his downfall. Another example of pride and prosperity was that of Uzziah, one of the kings of Israel, who also met disaster. (2 Chron. 26:11-23) Nebuchadnezzar brought his beastly insanity upon himself by his wrongful course. God was in no wise responsible for that madness, any more than God is responsible for the beastly madness of the modern rulers of &quot;Christendom”. (Dan. 4:29-37; Luke 21:24) Jehovah did not say, as his message delivered by Daniel shows, &quot;I will create in him a beast’s heart,” but he did say, &quot;Let a beast’s heart be given unto him [by another].” (Dan. 4:16) Doubtless God permitted a wicked spirit, a part of Satan’s organization, to take control of Nebuchadnezzar, just as he permitted wicked .spirits to get control of the herd of swine. (2 Chron. 18:18-22; Matt. 8:28-32) God has permitted the same crowd of wicked spirits associated with Satan to imprison the &quot;sons of God” who sinned in Noah's day. By reason of his own fall Nebuchadnezzar found himself in a shameful and insane condition, and when his heart was lifted up ami he was hardened in pride God took away his throne from him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Nebuchadnezzar was like a wild beast, and Daniel called this to the attention of Bels'mzzar: &quot;And he. was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was make like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven ; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointed: over it whomsoever he will.” (Dan. 5:21) At the end of the seven years described Nebuchadnezzar came to know that' Jehovah, &quot;the most high God,” is the ruler; but Belshazzar his son had failed to learn that great truth, and Daniel was reminding him of that fact. The &quot;seven times” of the Gentiles ended in 1914, and, like Belshazzar, the visible rulers of the world failed to then learn the vital truth that Jehovah is God, although they had been told of it time and time again. Had they learned this great and all-important truth they would not have held a modern feast, such as Belshazzar held, and which present-day world carousal was foreshadowed by his feast. The modern rulers failed to give heed to the fact that Jehovah sets up whomsoever he wills, and in due time debases those who go contrary to bis will. God did not &quot;set up” the selfish rulers of the earth, nor did he set up the proud and self-exalted pope, the clergy, and other like austere men. God sets up what the world considers the &quot;basest” or lowest, that is to say, Christ, who abased himself, and whom Jehovah God has exalted even as lie had caused to be foretold by his prophets. (Ezek. 21: 26, 27 ; Dan.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">4: 17) In 1931 Jehovah God by his witnesses brought this great fact to the attention of the rulers of this world, but they failed to give heed thereto or to learn any part of such great and important truths.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Walcltljwcr,</span><span class="font3"> 1931, pages 277, 278.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> The proud failed to take warning, and refined to humble themselves before the mighty hand of God, just as Belshazzar failed to take warning ami humble himself before God. Therefore said Daniel: “And thou his son, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font3">Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this.” (Dan. 5:22) When the World War came the rulers were told that that was in fulfilment of prophecy, marking the end of Satan's power and rule, and the end of their own power and rule, and that God’s kingdom was now at hand; but they failed and refused to give heed thereto. Since 1918 the purpose of Jehovah to destroy the organization of this wicked world has been repeatedly told to the rulers as a notice and warning to them; hence they can never plead ignorance concerning Jehovah's King and his kingdom. With the completion of the ‘pouring out of the seventh vial’, which pouring out began in 1928, “Christendom” has received full notice that, she is weighed in the balance, is found wanting, and is going to be destroyed. It is the handwriting on the wall; ami the rulers, although being informed, refuse to repent and refuse to cease interfering with Jehovah’s witnesses in carrying the message of truth to the people. They show their stubbornness and disregard of God’s Word by continuing to oppose the delivering of the testimony by .Jehovah’s witnesses. These facts have recently been presented to the Congress of the United States, at the hearing of which Big Business, the clergy, and the political representatives were present; and instead of giving heed to the message and acknowledging Jehovah God as supremo, such rulers, like Belshazzar, appealed to their own “wise men”, including the clergy, and ignore Jehovah’s witnesses and His message of truth, and by their course of action they continue to reproach the name of Jehovah the Most High. They have heard the truth and have had full opportunity to know what course to take, but, like Belshazzar, they spurn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The Lord Jesus at the temple as Jehovah’s Chief Executive Officer has caused the warning to be given to “Christendom” time and again. As evidence of such warning there is here cited the “Warning” resolution of July 1931. above referred to, also the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kinf/dom</span><span class="font3"> booklet, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font3"> booklet, and other like booklets since distributed. Instead of giving hei&lt;1 to this me-sage of warning from the Lord the rulers of the world foreshadowed by Belshazzar have ridiculed, reproached and persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">held </span><span class="font3">them </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font3">to scorn before others, and have thus lifted up themselves against Jehovah even as did Belshazzar. Said Daniel: “But hast lifted up thyself against the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font3">of heaven; and they have brought the vessels </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of his </span><span class="font3">house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them ; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, word, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.” (Dan. 5:23) The wicked conduct of the modern rulers of “Christendom” in persecuting Jehovah's- witnesses is in fact against “the Lord of heaven”, because these witnesses bring not their own message, but the message from the Lord God. These matters have been plainly stated before the rulers of the present day in the publications above mentioned, and also in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Books Oue, Two, and Three. The rulers, instead of giving heed to God’s message, have, continued to drink the wine of Babylon, make tinir.s-elves drunk, and use Jehovah’s witnesses in a disgraceful way to amuse themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was ‘the finger of Almighty God’, that is to say, his beloved Son Christ Jesus, that did the writing upon Belshazzar’s banquet hall: “Then was the part of the hand sent from him ; and this writing was written.” (Dan. 5:2-1) Sir.ee Jehovah has poured out his spirit upon all bis faithful witnesses he has sent forth these witnesses and used them to write his message of truth ‘upon the wall’ of reveling “Christendom”, but the rulers have ignored and despised the message and wickedly persecuted the messengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>I,;</sup> Belshazzar’s feast of wine-drinking and debauchery (lid not eease after the handwriting appeared; on the contrary, the misuse of (he golden vessels of the temple continued. Likewise during the time the antitypical plagm-s were being poured out upon the world, trom 1926 to 1929, the carousal of “Christendom” has continued and those participating therein have increased their hatred and bitterness toward Jehovah’s witnesses. During recent years the faithful remnant, under the direction of Jehovah's Chief Officer, have continued to boldly, plainly and fearlessly inform '■Christendom” that this world organization is that of the Devil. That message delivered, and the reaction of “Christendom” thereto, is all well summed up in the words of Jehovah’s prophet Daniel spoken to Belshazzar on the occasion of his feast, to wit: “And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UP1IARS1N.” (Dan. 5:25) From an authority on oriental literature the following is quoted: “These mysterious words are Aramaic. They are rendered on the margin of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span><span class="font3"> ‘Numbered, numbered, weighed, and divisions’; Pharsin being the plural of the noun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pcres,</span><span class="font3"> Mene being the regular passive participle of its verb in the Peal species, and Tekel being regarded as likewise a passive participle, with the realization which is traditionally given to it changed from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tekil</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tekel</span><span class="font3"> to conform to the sound of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mene’. </span><span class="font3">These letters were not vocalized as written on the wall, i nd might have bcm pronounced in a variety of ways. Even if the correct pronunciation had occurred to me of the wise men as among several possibilities, he Lad no means of establishing the correctness of his reading or of interpreting the words.*’—Davis </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of the Bible, page</span><span class="font3"> 491. (Sec also McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. VI, page 89.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” The king and his company of revelers had seen the handwriting on the wall in this strange language, and now they must be told what it meant. Had they been entirely sober they might have been able to read the words, even though they did not get an understanding thereof. Daniel, who foreshadowed Jehovah’s witnesses, God now used to both read and interpret the strange words. Likewise “Christendom” had heard the words concerning God’s kingdom and the fall of Satan's organization at Armageddon, and had heard these words repeated time and again. Had “Christendom” been sober her wise men might have read them with some understanding; but, being drunk with the wine of Babylon, they neither properly read nor understood. But it is the will of God that “Christendom” must be told concerning the words and the meaning of the “handwriting on the wall”, particularly as from 1926 to 1929, whin this message was delivered to “Christendom” in fulfilment of these words. The interval between 1929 and 1930 afforded the rulers time to investigate and learn, and time to determine what attitude they would take toward God and 1 is people, and their work being done on earth. In the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the People,</span><span class="font3"> distributed in 1927, Big Business, conscienceless politicians and hypocritical religion were exposed, and, among other things, these words were used: “The Word of God's nd the physical facts prove that ‘organized Christianity’ or ‘Christendom’ is a failure,” that is to say, i:i weighed in the balance and found wanting. The metropolitan press took notice of the message in fulfilment of the “handwriting on the wall” and denounced Jehovah’s witnesses who delivered the message as the ‘uncompromising foes of organized Christianity’. Seven years later, to wit, in 1934, before a Congressional committee at Washington, D.C., one of the representatives of “organized Christianity” placed in evidence before such Congressional committee the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom far the People,</span><span class="font3"> containing the message of warning, and called attention to that message r.s the reason for refusing Jehovah’s witnesses the use of radio facilities to proclaim God’s Word of truth. Thus “Christendom's” representatives admit that they have seen the “handwriting on the wall” and that they saw it in 1927. “Christendom” and her representatives are therefore estopped from ever being heard to say that they did not sec the “handwriting on the wall”. They admit that they saw it; but now, how about the interpretation ?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Daniel, by the grace of God, was used to give the interpretation of the mystic words, as he said, “This </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">the interpretation of the thing” (vs. 26) ; which message the king and his revelers had seen, but they were too drunk and blind to appreciate the meaning thereof. Likewise the rulers of “Christendom”, drunk</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">en </span><span class="font3">with the wine of Satan's organization, were and are dull-eyed and cruel of heart and slow of understanding. They read the words, but they understand not. It was in 1918 that the great Judge, Christ Jesus, came to the temple and began judgment. Concerning the clergy of “Christendom” and their allies the words of Jehovah’s prophet now apply, which words Jesus quoted, to wit: “Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, He [Jehovah] hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory [Jehovah’s glory in the temple], and spake of him.” (John 12:39-41; Isa. 6:9,10) The fulfilment of the interpretation began upon “Christendom” and began to be told to “Christendom” on July 26, 1931, when the message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope, of the World,</span><span class="font3"> accompanied by the resolution of “Warning”, was spoken and widely broadcast, and later distributed throughout “Christendom”, and especially among the rulers of “Christendom”. Then was made known for the first time the “new name” that Jehovah gave to his people and by which name, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses, they arc now known and recognized by the rulers of “Christendom”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHOM DANIEL FORESHADOWED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Daniel gave the interpretation, which foreshadowed the interpretation of Jehovah’s message of the present day. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Meno</span><span class="font3"> means “numbered”. The repeating of the word or writing upon the wail twice, as stated in the text, shows two numberings. Daniel knew that God had numbered Babylon, Ihc world power, and this he had learned from the prophecy of Jehovah uttered by Jeremiah; and Daniel so states. (Dan. 9:1, 2; Jer. 25:11-13) Jehovah numbered not only typical Babylon, but also Satan’s organization, the Greater Babylon, symbolized by his woman. The divine statement at Genesis 3:15 discloses that Jehovah then fixed a time certain during which he would not interfere with Satan and his efforts to turn men away from the true God but would abide his own due time to raise up a seed by which he would destioy Satan and his organization. The words written upon the wall and interpreted by Daniel show two separate and distinct numberings, the first “mene” of the numbering of Babylon fixed the end of the “times of the Gentiles” or beginning of “the time of the end” for Babylon, and this time is fixed as at A.D. 1914. The seven symbolic times, each of 360 years, beginning with the destruction of Jerusalem by typical Babylon in the year 606 B.C., would necessarily end 2,520 years thereafter, to wit, A.D. 1914, at which time also the prophecy uttered by Christ Jesus began to be fulfilled.—Lev. 26:18,21. 24; Dan. 12:4; Afatt. 24: 3-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The second “mene” would apply to the finishing, or ending, of Satan’s organization: “And finished it,” or, according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font3"> “and brought it to an end.” The final end comes at Armageddon and just before which the witness work must be completed. (Matt. 24:14,21,22; see Rev. 18:10,17,19) The message first promulgated at the Columbus (Ohio) convention July 26, 1931, and which appears in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font3"> gave forth the notice and warning to the rulers of “Christendom” similar to the interpretation which Daniel gave before Belshazzar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tckel</span><span class="font3"> that appeared written on the wall means “weighed”. It is from the verb meaning “to balance ”, and was used </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">by Job: “Let me be</span><span class="font3"> weighed in'an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands.” (Job 31:6,7) Jehovah’s prophet Daniel informed Belshazzar that his kingdom was done for and the reason thereof was, as Daniel stated: “TEKELj.Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.” (Vs. 27) The uninterrupted reign of great Babylon, Satan’s organization, came to an end in 1914. It was then weighed in the balance and found wholly wanting. The weighing consumes time, which weighing began when the official Weighmaster, Christ Jesus, appeared at the temple of Jehovah, and he continues weighing until the enforcement of the second “inene”, when it is completely finished, marking the final end, and which final end is after the finishing of ‘the preaching of this gospel of the kingdom’, at which time the final end comes in the great tribulation. “For her [Babylon’s] sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.” (Rev. 18:5) By his prophet Jehovah says: “We would have healed Babylon [while being weighed], but she is’not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment rcacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.” (Jer. 51:9) She is weighed in the divine balances, which are impartial and absolutely true and accurate. “A just weight and balance arc the Lord’s; all the weights of the bag arc his work.” (Prov. 16:11) “Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree arc a lie: to be laid in the balance, they arc altogether lighter than vanity.” (Ps. 62:9) It is during the weighing of Babylon by the Lord Jesus Christ that the ruling elements of the earth, pictured by Belshazzar, his wives, concubines, lords and other officers, put on the vestments or garments by which they identify themselves as anti-God, antikingdom, and as Devil worshipers, hence deserving to be slaughtered at Armageddon as Jehu slaughtered the Devil’s typical crowd.—2 Ki. 10:18-26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> While the weighing progresses Jehovah’s witnesses in obedience to commandment go through “Christendom” and mark those whom God would save from the slaughter. (Ezek. 9: 3-10) Concerning “Christendom” Jehovah says, “Thou art found wanting.” The message of truth, delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, is God's message, and he directs its preparation and furnishes the means of delivery; and in doing so he uses radio stations, transcription recording machines, and a little army of faithful men and women who go from house to house delivering the message which other machines have printed. The message of the Lord declares concerning “Christendom” that she is ‘weighed in the balances and found wanting’; and this message is particularly contained in such as “Can the American Government Endure?” “America’s End,” in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font3"> and in like booklets which are distributed throughout the land called “Christendom”, and also in “heathen” lands, so called, where few Christians reside. Modern Babylon has been told that “the world is sick unto death and is going to die”. The rulers in “Christendom” are wanting in fear of God, and this is shown by the fact that they spurn his message of truth and continue to profane the “vessels” of God, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses. “Christendom” is wanting in love for. God and for his kingdom, and ’they show this bj’ continuing the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, thus disclosing that they are acting under the direction of Gog, Satan’s chief officer. (Ezek. 38:1,2) “Christendom,” which is part of Babylon, the Devil’s organization, has defamed the name of Jehovah and desecrated his temple; hence “his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple”.—Jer. 51:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> At Armageddon the rulership of the world will be snatched away from Satan and taken over by Christ Jesus. Foreshadowing this, Daniel’s interpretation continues in these words: “PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” (Dan. 5:28) In verse twenty-five the word “Pharsin” or “Upharsin” is used, and which is the plural form of the verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Peres</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Peras,</span><span class="font3"> meaning “to split up”, “to deal,” “tt' distribute.” (Isa. 58:7; Lev. 11:3,4) In verse twenty-five the plural “Pharsin” calls attention to two dividings or dealings-out, that is to say, the dealing out of Babylon to Christ in 1914, when the Devil and his crowd were cast out of heaven, an I the second dealing-out, which takes place at the battle of Armageddon, when the organization of Satan is destroyed and the ruling of the world completely taken over by Christ Jesus. Daniel’s use of the word “Peres”, in the singular in verse twenty-eight above quoted, seems to apply specifically to the final dividing or splitting-up, at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Satan combines all his forces in his organization that are on the earth; hence the words “thy kingdom is divided” do not mean Satan’s organization falls by reason of internal dissension and division. This is not the ‘dividing’ mentioned in Revelation 16:17-19. The rule of the world will be forcibly snatched away from Satan at Armageddon by Christ Jesus the Conqueror; and concerning this the prophet Daniel records his vision which he had in the first year of the reign of Belshazzar, to wit: “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font3">there was given him dominion, and glory, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font3">of the saints </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font3">Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.”—Dan. 7:1.3, 14, 27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The rulcrship taken from Babylon, as the record states, was “given to the Medes and Persians”. The dividing of the kingdom seems to support the conclusion that there are two divisions of the conquering forces, to wit, the unseen and the seen. These two divisions of conquering forces seem to be symbolized by the ram’s “two horns” mentioned by the prophet: “The ram which thou rawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.” (Dan. 8: 20) The Scriptures always give precedence to the Medes. They are mentioned as a very ancient people, the sons of Ja-pheth. The Medes seem to symbolically represent the invisible organization of the Lord Dod, which includes cherubim, seraphim and angels. Persians are Scrip-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">turally </span><span class="font3">mentioned </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font3">picturing Christ Jesus; hence in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">prophecy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Daniel </span><span class="font3">the Persian ruler seems to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font3">particularly picture the anointed ones of Jeho</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vah </span><span class="font3">on earth, members of the Christ, to wit, the remnant.—Isa. 45:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> It is the invisible army of Jehovah, led by Christ Jesus, that will destroy Satan’s organization. “The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">see. </span><span class="font3">Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regarel silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. Their bows also shall dash the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">young </span><span class="font3">men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare chil</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">dren. And </span><span class="font3">Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.” (Isa. 13:1,17-19) “Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medvs: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">his device is against Babylon, to destroj’ it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">temple. . . . They are vanity, the work of errors: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">the time of their visitation they shall perish.” (Jcr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">51:11-18) In </span><span class="font3">the execution of Jehovah’s judgment against Satan’s organization ‘all the saints’ have a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">part. (Ps. </span><span class="font3">149: 6-9) The part to be performed by the division of God’s army on earth is merely that of declaring the day of the vengeance of our God, calling attention to the “handwriting on the wall”, and announcing Jehovah’s purpose to destroy Satan’s rule and give the rulership of the world to Chrht Jesus. Such is the very part the remnant have been having and doing particularly since 1926. The ‘handwriting </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font3">the wall’ has been explained to the rulers, and now' the remnant is engaged in telling the people of good will what is about to come to pass and in instructing them in the way of the Lord. Now Jehovah's witnesses are engaged in a world-wide distribution of the message “Dividing the People”, that those of good will may see the right way and have opportunity to take it in order that they may receive the favor of Jehovah in the greatest of all crises, just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2T</sup> Belshazzar the king had given his word that the one who could show the meaning of the handwriting on the wall should be rewarded. (Dan. 5:7) Probably Belshazzar did not enjoy the divine message v.'Hirk Daniel delivered in response to his question. Probably he did not then believe what Daniel said, but, having given his word, he would keep it: “Then commanded BeLhazzar and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain ol‘ gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.” (Dan. 5:29) While it is true that the king Belshazzar decreed that Daniil should be made “third ruler in the kingdom”, Daniel did not assume the duties of that office during the reign of Belshazzar, because Belshazzar was slain that very night. Daniel satisfactorily explained the handwriting on the wall, and his exaltation by Belshazzar surely brought great chagrin to Babylon’s wise-men. This seems to clearly correspond to Haman’s being compelled to lead a horse on which Mordecai rode through the public streets and to announce to the people that, Mordecai was one honored by the king. (Esther 6:4-12; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font3"> page 132) Just what relationship this particular part of the prophecy nmy bcai- to Jehovah’s witnesses and to Iheir position in the near future would be a mere guess, and Imnce the guess would better not be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> On that same day that Babylon fell Darius the Mede became the ruler of the nations of the world; and the Scriptures show Darius pictured the supreme ruler. Darius carried out the decree that Belshazzar had announced, and made Daniel the third ruler in the kingdom, this being the order: first ruler, Darius; second, Cyrus; and third, Daniel. (Dan. 6:1-3) Corresponding to this, at the complete fall of Babylon, which is Satan’s organization, including “Christendom”, the order of the rulers of the world will be this, to wit: first, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font3"> supreme ruler, Jehovah; second, Jesus Christ; third, the members of the body of Christ, and hence the “faithful and wise servant” ch-r-s, whom Daniel foreshadowed.—1 Cor. 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> While Belshazzar and his lords were feasting handwriting appeared on the wall, and shortly thereafter Belshazzar and his revelers were slain. Tim ‘handwriting’ has now appeared on the wall of “Christendom”, and her doom is sealed. It is certain that Satan’s seed, that is, those who now rule the earth, will be destroyed. “In that night was Belshazzar ll.e king of the Chaldeans slain.” (Dan. 5:30) The Bible does not disclose who slew Belshazzar. What profane history has to say about it deserves no considered ion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was the agency of Jehovah that did the slaying; hence there is pictured the work of Jehovah’s Executioner enforcing the divine judgment, which is already written against Satan’s organization. At Armageddon those who have long ruled the world in wickedness, and have oppressed the human race and shamefully dishonored God’s holy name and his kingdom, will come to an end, and Christ Jesus will do the executing of all the wicked ones.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> At this point in the world’s history embraced within the prophecy Babylon as a world power ceased, and the rule of the Medes and Persians there began: “And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.” (Dan. 5:31) The name “Darius” means “coercer, or, conservator”. In fact, Darius did coerce Babylon completely and preserved or conserved Daniel the faithful servant and prophet of Jehovah God. It is said that Darius was a kinsman, that is, the uncle, of Cyrus, and probably Cyrus was the heir of Darius. This seems to suggest that Darius the Mede pictures the supreme power, Jehovah himself, the Most High. He began his reign as the world ruler at the fall of Babylon, which corresponds or pictures the fall of Satan’s organization, and Darius there pictures Jehovah, who is, of course, the First Ruler in the great universal kingdom. Cyrus, the second ruler, pictures Jehovah’s “heir of all things”, that is, Christ Jesus, to whom Jehovah gives the kingdom and all the nations of the earth as a possession. (Ps. 2: 8) He is the one with whom Jehovah associates himself in the destruction .of Satan’s organization. The fact that the scripture tells that Darius was about sixty-two years old when he became the first ruler of the world power would further indicate that he there pictured Jehovah, “the Ancient of days.”—Dan. 7 : 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> At the fall of Babylon Darius the Mede, rather than Cyrus the Persian, is made foremost; and this would seem to say that as the result of the battle of Armageddon Jehovah the great King, who is the Supreme One, is made known to all creation that lives, and that his name is fully vindicated, and he is seen to be above every creature, including his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, the world’s King. All secular historians have difficulty in identifying Darius the Mede, and do not mention him by name, but do give prominence to Cyrus the Persian. The Bible makes known Darius •. and this corresponds to the. further fact that the rulers in this world do not know Jehovah God, and that they make mention of his name only in derision, while at the same time they give prominence to the name of Jesus Christ, even though they do so for a selfish reason. After Armageddon all shall know Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Jehovah, by permitting his people to have some understanding of the prophecy at this time, is further manifesting his loving-kindness toward his anointed and thus he brings great comfort to them even as he has in his Word given promise to do. (Rom. 15:4) The fact that Daniel survived the fall of Babylon and lived even unto the third year of the reign of Cyrus the Persian king (Dan. 10:1) would suggest that the Greater Darius (The Conservator, Jehovah) will keep alive at least a part of the remnant during the battle of Armageddon and grant to them some service on earth after the battle, which service will be to the honor and glory of Jehovah's name. “Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.” —Ps. 48:1-3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>TEMPTATION AND FALL OF ECCLESIASTIC1SM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">HE term “ecclesiasticism” applies to all denominations, Catholic and Protestant, which have united with the financial and political elements </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the earth to form the governing or controlling factors </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">ru’e the world. To these ecclesiastics the Devil presented the three great temptations. These temptations he had also presented to Eve in the garden of Eden. She yielded and fell. The same three temptations were presented to Jesus by the Devil, and Jesus resisted all of them and gained the victory. And now mark how they were presented to the ecclesiastical systems and how these have all fallen to the wiles of the Devil and have become a part of his organization, the evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures declare that God does not tempt anyone. The apostle James (1:13-15) writes: “Let </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font3">man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font3">any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” It was the desire of these ecclesiastical leaders for honor and power that led them into temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd of the flock of God. (Ileb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 2:25) In the organization </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the church the Lord provided for undershepherds, designating them as overseers and teachers. Upon these is enjoined the duty and obligation of feeding the flock of God, to unselfishly look well to the interest of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">such (1 Pet. 5: </span><span class="font3">2-4), and not to lord it over the people </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the Lord. Contrary to the Word of God, the elec</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tive </span><span class="font3">elders or shepherds of the denominational church</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">es </span><span class="font3">in earlier centuries organized councils, synods, presbyteries, and like bodies politic, elected their own members to the high offices of popes, cardinals, bish</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ops, </span><span class="font3">doctors of divinity, reverends, and so forth, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">thus </span><span class="font3">formed and created what are properly termed the ecclesiastics of “Christendom”, the high personages </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">the denominational churches, Catholic and Protes</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tant. </span><span class="font3">God did not tempt these men so to do. Of their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">own </span><span class="font3">desire were they led to these steps; and thereby </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font3">laid themselves open to the great Tempter, who promptly presented to them temptations similar to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font3">which were presented to Eve and Adam and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">later </span><span class="font3">to Jesus Christ; namely, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.—1 John 2:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consider, first, the lust of the flesh (or body): The power gained by the ecclesiastics in the church, by reason of their position, they have used for their own selfish purposes. They have fed themselves and let the flock of God go without attention. (Ezek. 34:8) Selfishly they have advanced their own private interests, permitted the people to go without spiritual </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">food, </span><span class="font3">and thereby have caused a famine in the land </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">the hearing of the Word of God. Yielding to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">temptation </span><span class="font3">to use their powers for selfish purposes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font3">fell.—Araos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Second, Just of the eyes (dr mind) : Desiring to possess the seductive things of this world, and to be admired by men rather than be approved of God, the clergy have yielded to the lust of the eyes; they have clothed themselves in scarlet and long, flowing robes, decked themselves with jewels, and have arrogantly assumed a form of godliness while denying the power thereof. They fell ready victims to this temptation. —2 Tim. 3: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Third, pride of life: Jesus instructed his representatives to preach the gospel of his kingdom and to awa.it patiently his second coming, when he would establish the kingdom. He admonished them to keep themselves separate from the world. The ecclesiastics, or clergy, have boldly assumed to represent the Lord on the earth. Satan held before them the temptation that, as the Lord's representatives, they could establish the kingdom of God on earth without waiting for the second coming of Christ; the condition being that they should join hands with the commercial and political powers of earth, which were already under the control of Satan. This appealed to their “pride of life”. To them it was a wonderful thing to bring the capitalists and the politicians into the church, They yielded to this seductive temptation; they set about immediatcl.v to obtain control and rulcrship of the world, without the aid of the Lord and contrary to his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy met the conditions and they have failed. They have worshiped the Devil, sanctified war, for pay have acted as military recruiting officers, and have resorted to other devilish methods to gain their selfish and ambitious ends. They have ignored God and the Lord Jesus, and have waxed rich anil powerful, while being associated with their allies and under the direction of the super-mind of the god of this world. They have fallen to the temptation, and have carried out their part of the Devil’s arrangi-ment to blind the people to God's purposes. They stand self-confessedly guilty before God and man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ecclesiastics, to wit, popes, cardinals, bishops, reverends, doctors of divinity, and theological professors, have claimed the exclusive right and authority to interpret the Scriptures, and presumptuously deny the right of anyone to preach the gospel except such as are ordained by them. They have set aside the pure doctrines of God’s Word and through their various organizations have constituted themselves the fountains of doctrines, which doctrines they have sent forth as a river, claiming such to be a life-giving stream for the benefit of the people, whereas in truth and in fact theirs has been a message of fraud and deceit and a stream of sickness and death. By these false and deceptive doctrines the people have been blinded to the purposes of God, and his great provision for salvation has been hid from their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Claiming for themselves the exclusive authority to interpret the Scriptures, for a long time the ecclesiastics kept the people in ignorance of the tent of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bible by discouraging them in studying it; but now in this day of greater education, when the people might read and understand the Scriptures, these ecclesiastical leaders boldly and flippantly deny the inspiration of the Word of (tod. Foreknowing that they would take this course, God caused his prophet Jeremiah to write concerning them: ‘‘They have foisaken me, the fountain of living waters [source of life and truth], and hewed them out cisterns [man-made systems and doctrines], broken cisterns, that can hold no water [really contain no life-giving truth].”—Jer. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the purpose of turning the minds of the people away from the true God and blinding them the ecclesiastics have taught false doctrines, of which the following are a few, and which are set out here in contrast with the truth for the purpose of comparison, to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible teaches that man was created perfect, and that because of sin he was sentenced to death, thereby losing perfection of organism and the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Modern ecclesiastics teach that man is a creature of evolution; that he never fell, and never lost the right to life by reason of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible plainly states that man is mortal, and that because of Adam's sin all arc born sinners subject to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastics teach that all men have immortal souls, which cannot die, which doctrine is supported only by Satan’s great lie, namely, ‘There is no death.’—Gen. 3:4; John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible plainly teaches that the wages of sin is death, and that death and destruction is the punishment of the willfully wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastics teaeh that there is no real death, and that the punishment of the selfish and wicked is conscious torment, eternal in duration; and that to escape such terrible punishment the people must join their church denominations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures plainly teach that Jehovah is God, the great First Cause; and that Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, is the I’cdeemer of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastics teach the unscriptural, God-dishonoring doctrine of the trinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The inspired Word of God declares that Jesus Christ is the ransomer of all; and that all members of the human race shall, in due time, have an opportunity to know about the ransom and receive its benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastical teachings of evolution, human immortality, eternal torment and the trinity are denials of the ransom by implication; and now the chiefest among them deny that J&lt;sus was any more than an ordinary man, deny that there is any value in his sacrifice, deny the only Lord God and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by which mankind is redeemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures teach that Christ Jesus is King, the only One who has the right and authority to rule the earth in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastics teach the divine right of earthly kings, who are made by big business, to rule the people; and the ecclesiastics have joined hands with big business and big politicians to enforce this rule and to control the peoples of the earth because, they say, it is the divine arrangement for them to rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus constituted his apostles as the foundation of the Kingdom, and the Scriptures teach that the apostles have no successors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastics have fraudulently claimed to be successors of the apostles, and thereby have arrogated to themselves great authority and have attempted to deceive, and have deceived the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible teaches and emphasizes the second coming of Christ, the great Prince of Peace, that he will take unto himself his power to reign; it admonishes all the followers of the Lord to faithfully proclaim this message of his coming kingdom, and to advocate and follow peace with all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ecclesiastics teaeh and advocate war; they have sanctified war and wrest the Scriptures to justify their conclusion; they have repeatedly had their portraits made with, and exhibited with, great warriors of the world; they have turned their church edifices into recruiting stations; they have received and accepted filthy lucre in consideration of rendering service for recruiting young men for the war, and have willfully preached them into the trenches. And now when the evidence is plain and conclusive that the old world has ended, that the Lord for the second time is present and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, the ecclesiastics ignore the proof, ami scorn, ridicule and persecute those who dare tell the truth to the people. Instead of bidding welcome to the King of glory, and telling the people of his kingdom and the blessings it will bring they openly unite with the Devil in his schemes to control the peoples of the earth in a compact designated as the League of Nations; and piously and fraudulently they declare it to be the ‘‘political expression of the kingdom of God on earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus ccclesiasticism throughout ‘‘Christendom” has undeniably fallen to the temptations which Satan has placed in its path, and now Jehovah God's time is at hand to clear ccclesiasticism off the face of the earth that the people of all lands may know that he is Jehovah, the only true and living God, the Almighty and Most High One, in whom is no lie or fraud or hypocrisy or injustice or anything selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">standeth in the congregation of the. mighty: he judg-eth among the gods. . . . Arise, 0 God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.—</span><span class="font3">Psalm 82.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE ISSUE AND THE WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">N</span><span class="font3">EVER was it so important as now that the people know the truth. Mankind’s great enemy, Satan, is putting forth all his efforts to prevent the people from knowing the truth. Many of the rulers are deceived and blinded by Satan, and likewise the people are blind to the truth. What, then, shall bo done that the people may know the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God, whose name is Jehovah, does not execute his purpose in secret. ITe gives due notice of his purposes. It was but a brief space of time after the expulsion of man from Eden that Satan formed a company of men ami caused them to hypocritically call themselves by the name of the Lord. The book of Genesis, chapter four, verse twenty-six </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(margin),</span><span class="font3"> testifies to this fact. Men hurried down the road to wickedness. Satan also led many of the spirit creatures of God into wickedness, causing them to leave their first estate in God’s organization, take on human form as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nephilim</span><span class="font3"> and fill the earth with violence. Because of this wickedness God determined to destroy that wicked generation. (Gen. 6:7) Before doing so, he sent Noah to bear witness concerning his purpose. (2 Pet. 2:5; 1 Pet. 3:20) That which Noah did was prophetic and foretold what would come to pass at the end of the world. Of this there is not the slightest doubt, because Jesus so declared.—Matt. 24:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When God would deliver his people from the oppressive hand of the ruler of Egypt, he sent Moses and his brother Aaron to give testimony before that ruler and the people,-of and concerning his purpose. (Ex. 3:18; 4:16; 5:1-4; see also Exodus 6 to 12) That what was there done by Moses and Aaron, and what followed thereafter with the Israelites, was prophetic and foretold similar things which would come to pass at the end of the world, is also certain. (1 Cor. 10:11) The prophecies fulfilled disclose two mighty organizations, to wit, God’s organization and Satan’s organization, which are at enmity and between which the war in heaven has been fought, and between which there is yet a great war to be fought, involving all the peoples of earth. It should be expected that Jehovah God would give due notice of that approaching conflict by having testimony given in his own good way, of and concerning his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great question at issue for early determination by all creatures is, Who is the Almighty God? That issue must and will have a final determination, because God has so declared it. When the mighty hunter Nimrod, under the supervision of Satan, built the tower of Ba-bel, the purpose was to prove that Satan was equal to Jehovah God, if not greater. Jehovah destroyed that tower and confused the speech of that people that they might learn that he is the Almighty </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Egypt’s king became arrogant and oppressed God’s chosen people, the issue then was, Who is the supreme God'? Jehovah demonstrated his supreme power at that time, that his name and his supremacy might be kept before his people for good, and to demonstrate to Egypt that Jehovah is God.—2 Sam. 7:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the king of Assyria appeared with arrogance before the ancient city of Jerusalem the issue raised by him then was, Who is the supreme God? Jehovah destroyed the Assyrian army that the people might sec who is supreme.—Isa. 36:18; 37:36-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today the world powers of combined “Christendom” give allegiance to Satan the Devil, and cast reproach upon Jehovah, while hypocritically claiming to be followers of Christ; and now the great issue is, Who is the Almighty God, and whom shall we obey? Jehovah has expressed his determination that the issue shall be settled, and that shortly; but before doing so, he will cause testimony to be given before the nations and peoples of the world of and concerning his purpose, to the end that the rulers and the people may have an opportunity to know the truth; and further, that all mouths will be for ever stopped from saying that they had no opportunity to know. That the giving of such testimony should immediately precede the final determination of the great issue is made sure by the words of Jesus Christ, the great Prophet of Jehovah God, when he said: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come. For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matt. 24:14, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that God would have this testimony given before the great time of trouble is proof that he would thereby furnish a warning to, as well as an opportunity for, those who hear to profit by the facts, break away from Satan’s organization, and seek safety under the power and protection of Jehovah. It is equally certain that Satan would do everything within his power to keep the rulers and the people from hearing the testimony, to the end that he might hold them in his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Testimony is given by witnesses, detailing certain facts that bear upon the issue. Who will be witnesses on the earth to testify to the name of Jehovah God as the Almighty One? That question can be determined by ascertaining whom God has used on former occasions when he would bring his name before creation. Jehovah puts his spirit upon men whom he sends to deliver his message of truth. That means that they are authorized to speak in his name. He endows such with power from on high to act as witnesses for him. His spirit is his invisible power operating according to his sovereign will. (2 Pet. 1:21) It is quite evident that God caused a record to be made of what he did in the past, to enable men to better understand what he will do in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When God organized the nation of Israel into his prophetic organization, he provided the priesthood to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">serve that people, and he caused the priests to be anointed with holy oil, thus indicating authority and approval from Jehovah. The holy oil was a representation of the holy spirit of God with which he anoints those who act in his behalf. Among other duties that must be performed by the priests of that time was that they were required to teach the people by informing them concerning God’s law and his purposes. (Alai. 2:7) The priests of that organization prophetically foretold a similar class that would serve his real organization ‘when Zion is builded up’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through his prophet God foretold the coming of his mighty Son Christ Jesus, the great Prophet of Jehovah. Concerning the work that lie was to do, the prophet Isaiah (61:1,2) wrote: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” When Jesus began his earthly work he took up the book containing that prophecy, read it in the hearing of others, and applied it to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He first read: “The .spirit of the Lord is upon me, because ho hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent ine to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that arc bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in jour cars.” (Luke 4:18,19,21) The fact that, in reading the prophecy at that time, Jesus omitted the words, “and the day of vengeance of our God,” must be significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He know that he would come again, and that at his second coming and the end of the world the “vengeance of our God” should be told to the people before that great and terrible day; and this conclusion is fullj- supported by what he subsequently said to his disciples. (Matt. 24:14,21) In the period of time elapsing from Pentecost (A.D. 33) until the coming of the Lord to his temple and the building up of Zion or God’s organization, his body members, that is to say, the members of the body of Christ, would be selected and gathered unto him. The last of these members on earth would constitute “the feet of him”, as the prophet Isaiah (52: 7, 8) terms them, and they must therefore perform the duties designated by the authority of their anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For three and one-half years Jesus gave testimony before the people and the rulers, telling of God's purposes. When he stood before the Roman governor Pilate and responded to the question concerning his mission on the earth and as to whether he was a king or not, he said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hearcth my voice.” (John 18:37) Thus he proved his mission to be that of the great Witness or Prophet of God, and that all who are really of the truth must hear and obey his voice and must be witnesses-together with him.—Luke 24: 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the titles given unto Jesus by Jehovah God is “the faithful and true witness”. (Rev. 3:14) It is also stated that his body members must be like him. (Rom. 8:29) This likeness must of necessity consist in this, that bis body members would be wholly and unreservedly devoted to Jehovah God and delight in keeping his commandments. That would mean that they must be witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s purpose in having the gospel preached from the time of Pentecost, fifty days after Jesus’ resurrection, until the coming of Christ Jesus to his temple was to take out from among men “a people for his name”. The wily enemy Satan early began to carry on his campaign to offset God’s purpose. Well knowing that he must operate by fraud and deceit, he projected into the minds of the leaders in the earthly organization of the church the conclusion that the mission of the church is to convert the world and to robe it in glory and beauty in preparation for the second coming of Christ Jesus. Satan knew that men could not do such a thing, but that to follow that course would keep them busy and would hide Gou’s real purpose from their understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When ancient Rome adopted a religion and named it the “Christian religion”, the leaders then began to carry on a great campaign to compel the people to become members of that church. That meant that Satan had gotten control of the organization and had made that organization the “religion” of his organization, therefore had made it a part of his organization which is called “Babylon”. Those who would not, yield to this influence were subjected to all manner of cruel treatment and torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The real purpose of the church was entirely lost to the sight of honest persons, and such was the result of Satan’s wicked influence. As the Jewish Pharisees were blind guides of the blind people when Jesus was on earth, even so the clergy, who are the counterparts of the Pharisees, became the blind guides of the people in the church, who likewise were blinded to the truth by Satan’s course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the conditions in the Roman church became intolerable, some of the more honest ones broke away to form what is known as the Protestant church. The Protestants also fell under the seductive influence of Satan, misconceived the purpose of the church, and believed it to be their duty to convert the world to Protestantism. As a result of. this, many bloody wars followed, especially in Europe, between the Catholic and Protestant church organizations. Both of these great organizations participated freely in the politics of the world and really became a part of the ruling factors. The truth was hid to them. This condition of misconception of the purpose of the church continued until the Lord began preparing the way before Jehovah and the restoration of the fundamental doctrines of the truth of God’s Word.—Mal. 3:1; 4: 5, G; Mark 9:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True Christianity means the faithful following by men in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, the Anointed of God. (1 Pet. 2:21) That means entire devotion to Jehovah God, and not to any man or to any worldly organization directed by man. It means that the true Christians or followers of Christ Jesus must be witnesses to the majesty and supremacy of Jehovah God and bear testimony to the truth of God’s Word. (John 18:37) In order to give testimony of the truth it is necessary for one to study and to understand the Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, which is the truth. —John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Organized Christian religionists” have entirely overlooked the Scriptural meaning of the second coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom. The Bible testimony is all one way, to wit, that the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom is to vindicate Jehovah’s name by proving that Jehovah is the supreme and true God, that he is the God of wisdom, justice, love and power, and from whom all life and blessings How. The Bible testimony further is that the kingdom of God under Christ is a righteous government, which kingdom or government will vindicate Jehovah’s name and is the only hone of the peoples of the world. In this year of 1934, when the nations and peoples all over the earth are in great distress and perplexity, “organized Christian religionists” entirely ignore the Scriptural testimony as to the cause of this trouble, and how the world can be brought out of this depression, and in the place and stead of the Scriptures they follow the theories of men and join in all man-made schemes to relieve mankind. These religionists not only entirely ignore the cause of the trouble, but appear to be entirely blind to the divine remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergj- and the politicians pose before the people as followers of Christ and by word of mouth say, “We implicitly believe in divine guidance,” and at the same time entirely ignore the Word of the divine God, who is-Jehovah the Most High. No one who is truly devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom can have any part in the political affairs of this world. If these men, as they say, did implicitly believe and trust in the divine God, then they would follow his Word and would see that the great climax of trouble and wickedness is now upon the earth because of Satan, and that soon God will destroy this wicked organization, and in its place there shall follow a rule of complete righteousness; and they would teach the people these truths, and inform them that the kingdom of God alone will, bring relief and blessings. Any persons who would join forces with socialists or communists or any other political organization in this day would thereby furnish the conclusive proof that they arc not the servants of Jehovah God, and do not see the issue.</span></p>
