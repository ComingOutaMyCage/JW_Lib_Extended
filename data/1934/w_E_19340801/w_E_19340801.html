<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Act of March 3, 1873.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LONDON CONVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">August 31 to September 3 inclusive are the days for a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses tit London, England. The convention will be held at the Alexandra Enlace, the public meeting being in the large hall al Alexandra Palace, Sunday, September 2. The forenoon of each day will be deleted to field service; afternoon and evening meetings for the interested. Those contemplating attending the London convention should address Convention Committee, 34 Craven Terrace, London, W. 2, England. The president of the Society expects to attend this convention and address the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVERTISING WATCHTOWER PROGRAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Advertising the Kingdom helps also to advertise the radio stations which are broadcasting the kingdom message. Hence all witnessing parties and all individuals engaging in the field service should mention the radio station in their vicinity which carries the Watchtower programs. This magnifies to the people called upon the message which Jehovah’s witnesses introduce, and often results in interest in the printed message on the part of the radio listener. This is one of the chief purposes of sending out the message over the radio, to encourage the people to read the literature. In this behalf the Society supplies radio folders, and all workers should make </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">constant</span><span class="font1"> use of them in house-to-house calling, leaving one of them, if nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC LECTURES BY TRANSCRIPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s blessing has been markedly upon the use of the portable transcription machine, lie Ims plainly ma,ntested that this machine meets the need of the hour, when the iwmj, under Gog, is seeking to curtail the use of the radio by God’s anointed and when the people’s ears are eager to hear, not man’s message, but God’s. The transcription machine has increased the power of Jehovah’s witnesses afield to preach 11 is truth manyfold, so that the desire for the literature is stimulated and study classes of many interested hearers are being formed. Besides more than 430 such machines in the United States alone, great numbers are now being effectively used m countries near and afar. For more information, write the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has made arrangements to construct and assemble portable transcription machines at our own factory at 117 Adams Street. These machines will be somewhat dill’erent in construction from those previously furnished. They will be spring-wound, and operated from a G-volt wetwell battery. Every machine will be furnished complete with the battery and a battery charger, so that it can be kept up to its full strength. We are pleased to announce that this machine can b? e icred at ?100, complete, to brethren in the United States.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIS KINDNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“IIow precious thy lovingkindness, 0 God; therefore the sons of men under the shadow of thy wings seek refuge: they abundantly relish the fatness of thy house, and out of the full stream of thine own pleasures thou givest them to drink. For with thee is the fountain of life, in thy light we see light.”—Ps. 36: 7-9, Roth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH having builded up Zion and gathered unto himself his saints, he gives them a broader view of his loving-kindness than previously it was possible for them to have. Those at the temple being now in the secret place of the Most High, and there taught of God by and through Christ Jesus, are commanded to go out amongst the people and from the housetops to declare the name of Jehovah, making known to those of good will the loving-kindness of Jehovah to the children of men. This loving-kindness, when known, is precious to those who love Jehovah God. They know that their own refuge is under the shadow of the wings of the Almighty, and they delight to point others to God's provision for their refuge. The rich provision of Jehovah makes glad the heart of everyone who is in his royal organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> By his great executioner Jehovah will mete out exact justice to those who have willfully and deliberately broken his everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of human life. God’s judgment toward mon is tempered with mercy toward those who have a good heart and who desire righteousness. He has commanded that his mercy shall be shown toward all those who have been unwittingly drawn into Satan’s trap and caused to break his law. His acts of justice are like the great deep, and his mercy endureth for ever. It is the privilege of those who desire knowledge and understanding to learn now about the loving-kindness of our God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah has made known to the temple company that he is the fountain of life and that there is none other. He has given them such knowledge not merely for their own good, but that they might make this known to those of good will and honest heart. The battle of the great day of God Almighty is near at hand, and in that battle Christ Jesus, the Vindicator, will destroy the wicked; but the kindness of Jehovah has provided a place of refuge for those who now turn their hearts toward righteousness, seeking to join themselves unto Jehovah’s organization. Such are known as the Jonadab class, because Jonadab foreshadowed them. Jehovah’s provision made for them in connection with his house is a rich provision. “Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and rccom-pensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Ei ghty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name, great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men; to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” (Jer. 32:18,19) There is an obligation laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses to bring these truths to the attention of the Jonadabs, that they may be advised of the only way of escape in the great disaster that shall shortly overtake the world. They must know Jehovah, take their stand on his side, and there remain steadfastly faithful, serving him, if they would receive God’s gift of life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CITIES OF REFUGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> To aid the student in the examination of what follows, a brief outline is here given, to wit: The cities of refuge provided by the law of God were a place of protection for those who had unawares or unwittingly broken the everlasting covenant by taking a human life. This loving provision made by Jehovah being announced at the time of making of the covenant of faithfulness shows that the cities of refuge foreshadow God’s loving-kindness for the protection of the people of good will during Armageddon; that they must come to know these truths after the building up of Zion and before Armageddon; that the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed on earth have a positive obligation laid upon them now which must be performed toward those of the Jonadab company; and that the Jonadabs must perform certain specific requirements in order to be assured of refuge during the trouble, and to ultimately receive life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah first spoke to Moses about the cities of refuge while Moses was in the plains of Moab. God having now made known Io his people that the word spoken by him, as recorded in Deuteronomy, applies since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, wc may expect to find that the provision for tire cities of refuge, as set down in the prophecies, have an antitypical fulfilment in close proximity to the time of taking the faithful followers of Christ Jesus into the covenant for the kingdom. “And the Lord spake unto Hoses in the plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan; then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.”—Num. 35: 1,10,11; Deut. 19:1-10.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">227</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Moses was a type of Christ Jesus; and what Moses did on the plains of Moab, as set forth in the book of Deuteronomy, and before the Israelites crossed the Jordan to Jericho, seems to have relation to the closing days of the time of the work of ‘preparing the way before Jehovah’. (Mal. 3:1; Deut. 18:15,18; Acts 3: 19-23) Shortly before .Moses ended his work, and after receiving instruction from Jehovah concerning the cities of refuge, he communicated that law to the Israelites: “These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan, in the wilderness, . . . And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them.” (Deut. 1:1,3) “Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; that the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; ami that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Rainoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites. And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.” (Deut. 4:41-44) Three of the cities of refuge were on the east side of Jordan, and three on the west side, in the land of Canaan, according to the commandments of Jehovah.—Num. 35:13,14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">’ Those of the temple company have learned that Jehovah at times uses his devoted people on earth to do certain things in fulfilment of his prophecy without their knowing at the time the meaning thereof; but afterwards Jehovah makes known to them these truths and thus exhibits his loving-kindness toward them in so using them to fulfil prophecy. The setting up of tire cities of refuge was notice to those who should have need therefor that God had made provision for their protection and refuge in time of distress. That was a part of the prophecy, and, being a prophecy, it must have its fulfilment at some later day and at the coming of the Greater Moses. On the 24th day of February, A.D. 1918, by the Lord’s grace and manifestly by his overruling providence and his direction, there was delivered, at Los Angeles, for the first time the message “The World Has Ended— Millions Now Living Will Never Die”, and thereafter that message was proclaimed by word of mouth and by printed publication throughout “Christendom”. No one of God’s people understood fully the matter at that time; but since being brought into the temple they see and understand that those on the earth who may live and not die are the ones who now ‘get into the chariot’, as Jonadab at the invitation of Jehu got into the chariot with Jehu. This throws more light on the Scriptures concerning the cities of refuge, and there must be some comforting information therein for the remnant at the present time.—Rom. 15:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah’s commandment was that there should be given to the Levites forty-eight cities and suburbs. This shows that the peoples of “Christendom” have no right to crowd Jehovah's servants, and particularly his anointed witnesses, out of the land, but must allow them freedom of activity and a reasonable amount for their maintenance. This also supports the conclusion that those who obtain literature, and thus receive an opportunity to gain a knowledge and understanding of the truth of and concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, should contribute something to defray the expense of publication, that more books may be brought to the people by Jehovah’s witnesses that other people might know the name of Jehovah and his loving-kindness. The Jonadab class now see that they have the privilege of aiding in this work and of bearing the message to others and thus showing their love for God and appreciation of his kindness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Out of the forty-eight cities provided for the specific benefit of the Levites there were designated six cities for a place of refuge. “And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.” (Num. 35:6) These six cities were assigned to those who had been redeemed or purchased by Jehovah in the place of Israel’s firstborn and who had been assigned exclusively to God’s service. (Num. 3:11-51) A city is a symbol of an organization; and the six cities thus appointed picture the organization of Jehovah’s anointed ones yet on the earth, representing Zion, the holy city, since it is builded up. There being six would not indicate an imperfect refuge, but rather would suggest that such is God’s provision for refuge while imperfect conditions still exist on the earth. There were no bridges or ferries over the Jordan river, and God’s loving-kindness is again made manifest by placing three of the&lt;e cities of refuge on the east and three on the west side of the river. The Levites and the priests (the priests were also Levites, and taken from that tribe) would picture that Jehovah’s kingdom organization had come, and such is the ‘city for which Abraham looked while he dwelt in a tent or tabernacle.—Ileb. 11: 9, 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> The Hebrew word for “refuge”, which is applied only to these six cities, means an “asylum”, as a receptacle into which something might be taken tor protection and safe-keeping. If Jehovah would nm :o such provision for one who slew another unawares, and wiio would therefore be helpless against the avenger or executioner, it would certainly seem reasonable that he would provide a similar place of protection for those people on earth who are of good will to be preserved from the sword of the great Executioner which will avenge the world-wide violation of the everlasting covenant pertaining to the sacredness of human life. All the nations have violated the everlasting covenant, and for this reason God will execute his vengeance upon them at the battle of Armageddon, which is the day of the expression of the vengeance of our God. In tiic cities of refuge the fugitive could be hid; and even so in the day of the execution of Jehovah’s vengeance he has provided a place of refuge where certain ones may be hid who learn the truth and who do that which is right.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">“ The total number of forty-eight cities were given to the Levites, and, out of that forty-eight, thirteen were given to the priests. (Josh. 21:1-19) Only one city of the priests was made a city of refuge, namely, Hebron, in the hill country of Judea. (Josh. 21:11-13) Doubtless that was the city visited by Alary, the mother of Jesus, when she went there to call upon Elisabeth, the wife of the priest, Zacharias. (Luke 1:39,40) The cities of refuge being given to those of the tribe of Levi, from which tribe the priests were taken, the manslayer seeking refuge was obliged to find protection in those cities. These cities of protection symbolized the organization of those who arc wholly devoted to God and his temple service. There was no other place that the manslayer could find refuge or safety. This is strong proof that the Jona-dab class who seek refuge against the day of vengeance must find it only in Jehu’s chariot, that is to say, in the organization of Jehovah, of which organization Christ Jesus is the Head and great High Priest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup> The cities of refuge would be set up after the Israelites reached Canaan: “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan; then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.” (Num. 35:9-11) This would seem to correspond to the time when the Elisha-Jehu work begins. The time is also indicated by the words of Moses, to wit: “When the Lord thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the Lord thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses; thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.” (Deut. 19:1,2) In 1914 Jesus was given the heathen for his inheritance and was sent forth to cast them out of the place wrongfully occupied. (Ps. 2: 8, 9) In 1919 Jesus brought his faithful remnant then on earth across the antitypical Jordan river and into the “land”, or kingdom condition, giving to them privileges and opportunities with him to serve, even as Joshua did the Israelites. The priests bearing the ark of the covenant were the first ones to enter the waters of the Jordan, and stood firm on the dry ground in the river until the people had crossed. (Josh. 3:7,8,15,17) Before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river Moses, by the direction of Jehovah, appointed three cities of refuge on the east side of the river. Likewise also before the remnant were gathered into the temple the Lord caused to be delivered his message “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”, meaning, of course, that they must be subject to the conditions announced by the Lord. There also began an announcement that the Elijah work had ended. It was a period of transition from the Elijah to the Elisha work performed by the faithful followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“UNAWARES”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> The provision of the law was that these cities of refuge were for the benefit of those who should kill a person unawares. “These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them; that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.” (Num. 35:15) What is meant by the words “every one that killeth any person unawares”? Satan’s organization on the earth has willfully and deliberately broken the everlasting covenant by wantonly and cruelly killing human creatures. God by his prophit declares his purpose to destroy Satan’s official organization on the earth because of the violation of the everlasting covenant. “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.” (Isa. 24:5, G) The commercial and political elements of Satan’s visible organization have deliberately planned and promoted cruel wars resulting in the wholesale shedding of innocent human blood. The religious clement of “Christendom”, and particularly those of the clergy, have sanctified those wars and blasphemously declared them to be in harmony with God’s will. All such willfid slayers shall perish at Armageddon. On the other hand there are the.&gt;e on the earth, and particularly in the realm of “Christendom”, who have worked for and supported the commercial and political systems of oppression; who have served in the armie.s and navies and taken human life; have upheld the commercial and political systems that have greatly oppressed the people; have been associated with religious systems which have sanctified war and have hence been a party to the crime of breaking the everlasting covenant; and those as members of the “strong-arm squad” who have aided in the persecution of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and have persecuted the^c who serve God. During the World War many men participated in these wrongful doings, and especially in the persecution of God’s people, and did so without malice and without knowledge that they were violating God’s law.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> The ruling elements in Israel had been guilty of just such wicked things as that described in the foregoing paragraph, and to them Jesus said: “That upon )ou may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.” (Matt. 23:35,36) The bloodguilty of the official clement of the nation of Israel that connived at and oppressed and killed the servants of God in particular, and oppressed and killed the defenseless people in general, were visited by God’s vengeance. That terrible punishment came upon Israel within a few years after the crucifixion of Jesus, and Peter, filled with' the spirit of God, speaking of that approaching trouble said to the Israelites: “Save yourselves from this untoward generation.”—Acts 2:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> Since the coming of Jesus to the temple there has been great persecution heaped upon the people of God in the land of “Christendom”, and there is bloodguiltiness on the part of those who have participated in this wrongful persecution deliberately. Others have had part therein unwittingly. “Christendom,” and particularly the official part thereof, lays great claim to doing the will of God, while at the same time being guilty of many flagrant crimes. The prophet of Jehovah, referring to such, says: “How is the [professed] faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followcth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.” (Isa. 1:21-24) The clergy, and the Boman Catholic hierarchy in particular, have connived with the big commercial and political wrongdoers in robbing and destroying the people; and the above prophecy applies to them, because such are the ones who claim to be God’s kingdom. Again says Jehovah’s prophet: “For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.” (Jer. 4:31) “And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. ’’ (Matt. 22: 6, 7) Among both the Jews and “Christendom” there have been those who have had no sympathy with such wrongdoing, yet by reason of circumstances have been forced into participating in and supporting these wrongdoers, to some degree at least, and are thus of the class that unwittingly or unawares are guilty of shedding blood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Those who have unwittingly or unawares supported these ■wrongdoers must have some way of escape, otherwise they would fall in the great trouble in the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Jehovah in his loving-kindness has made just such a provision as is needed for their escape, and the cities of refuge pictured that way of escape. Of the six cities of refuge “Moses severed three cities on this side [the] Jordan toward the sunrising”. (Deut. 4: 41-44) Joshua confirmed that selection after he had crossed the Jordan, and also appointed three cities in Canaan. (Josh. 20:7-9) The six cities were a place of refuge for the children of Israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner, thus showing that in the fulfilment of the prophecy the place of refuge would be for those in “Christendom”, and also for those associated with “Christendom” but not a part thereof, who might have need of such refuge and who desire and seek it. “That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojoumeth among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.”—Josh. 20:3, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup> If death resulted from a willful act by one using as a weapon an instrument of iron, or by throwing a stone, or with the hand weapon of wood, that is, a club, the one doing the wrongful act which resulted in death was guilty of murder and must die. (Num. 35:16-18) The murderer’s blood must be shed by the avenger or revenger of blood, that being the law of God for punishment in violation of the everlasting covenant. “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.” (Gen. 9:6) “The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeth him, he shall slay him.” (Num. 35:19) But if the killing was by accident or unawares, the manslayer might flee to the city of refuge for protection. “And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.”—Num. 35:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE AVENGER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> Who is “the avenger”, or the one who executes vengeance antitypically upon such wrongdoers? The very language of the law of God makes “the avenger” God’s official executioner. According to the Hebrew for “avenger” the execution of vengeance devolved upon one by reason of kinship, family relationship, such as the relationship of Boaz toward Naomi and Huth, and against the defiling near kinsman. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of 1925, page 182, paragraph 51, says: “It seems that Satan is the avenger of blood.” Clearly that statement is wrong, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> hereby retracts it. It is true that Satan has the power of death, given him when he was appointed man’s overseer, and that he does cause the death of many, even of some of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. But that does not mean that he is the official executioner of Jehovah, and particularly so far as the cities of refuge are concerned. Satan was never the kinsman of man so that he could fulfil the office of avenger or revenger by reason of being the near kinsman. Satan is a spirit creature; hence that alone would preclude him from filling the place. He was in no wise a kinsman of the Israelites, and holds no commission or appointment in connection with the cities of refuge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>19</sup> The great kinsman of the human race by birth is Jesus, being born of the virgin Mary, and hence he was the kinsman of the Israelites. (Gal. 4:4, 5) The perfect man Jesus bought the human race with his own precious blood and is therefore the Redeemer, and as the Redeemer of man he is clothed with authority from Jehovah his Father to give life to the human race. (Rom. 6: 23; Isa. 9: 6, 7) He is Jehovah’s great official executioner and delivers justice by repaying like with like upon the bloodguilty. “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.” (John 5:22,27; Deut. 19:21) Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and the executioner of all of God’s enemies, and in this execution of vengeance he associates with him those pictured by the “six men” each of which was armed with a slaughter weapon in his hand and used it under the direction of the Lord.—See Ezekiel 9:1,2; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> Book One, page 94.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> “The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.” (Num. 35:19) Jesus Christ, the great Executioner, will certainly meet or overtake all of the bloodguilty ones at Armageddon in the battle of the great day of God Almighty and will slay all such as are not in the cities of refuge. The provision of the law was, “that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.” (Num. 35:12) All other manslayers must be executed. The cities of refuge were prepared as a way of escape: “Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.” (Deut. 19:6,10) That provision of God’s law foreshadowed far greater things to come to pass after the faithful and approved ones are taken into the covenant for the kingdom. (Heb. 10:1; 12:12-29) The new covenant having been inaugurated, and the faithful being taken into the covenant for the kingdom, it would therefore follow that the antitypical cities of refuge are now set up and that these are for the benefit of those who come within the terms of God’s loving provision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> When Jehu -went forth to vindicate the name of Jehovah ‘his heart was hot’ to accomplish the work assigned him to do. Likewise the Greater Jehu, Christ Jesus, when sent forth to rule amongst his enemies and to vindicate Jehovah’s name, his “heart is hot” within him to accomplish that great work. The gross and flagrant violation of the everlasting covenant by the shedding of human blood must now be avenged, because this is the day of the vengeance of our God and the bloodguilty ones must fall by the hand of the great Executioner. Therefore the Devil ‘knoweth that his time is short’ and that soon the battle of the great day of God Almighty will be fought. Such will result in the meting out of justice to the murderers and in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Those who have been unwittingly associated with the devilish work against mankind, and in the heaping of infamy upon the name of Jehovah, and who would now escape to the city of refuge, must hasten thereto. They must get away from the Devil’s organization and take their place with the Lord God’s organization and remain there. For this reason it is written: “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul; be not cut off in her iniquity: for this is the time of the Lord’s vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense. Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple. ”—Jer. 51: 6,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>22</sup> For centuries the whole world has been under the dominating control of the wicked one, Satan, and his cruel and wicked organization. The Executioner will completely destroy such at Armageddon. Christ Jesus, the Executioner, is at the temple of Jehovah now for judgment, and God calls upon all the nations to keep silent before him and see and give heed to Jehovah's commandment. It is his time to make announcement of his purpose, and he gives notice and warning. Tho official element of Satan’s visible organization has received notice and warning that this world is Satan's organization and that it will be destroyed and that Jehovah’s witnesses are appointed by him to proclaim these truths and serve such notice. A proclamation of these truths has not comforted the clergy, big business and politicians, but, on the contrary, they bare refused to give heed to the notice and warning and have hardened their hearts. This is particularly true with reference to the clergy clement. This official element with deliberation, premeditation and malice aforethought continues to oppress God’s people and to persecute them for making proclamation of the truth. Furthermore, they do injury to and kill those who are devoted to the Lord. They do injury to the people of good will by constantly trying to keep away from them the truth. The official element of Satan’s organization, visible and invisible, are in a conspiracy to destroy the anointed of the Lord and to prevent the proclamation of the truth concerning Jehovah, his name and his purpose. (Ps. 83:1-5) Like Ahab and Jezebel, who suborned witnesses to have Naboth killed and his property stolen, the clergy and their allies now induce others to swear falsely against the witnesses of Jehovah and cause them to suffer, and thus they show malice and cruel hatred. These are such as lie in wait to slay those, against whom they hold malice. Concerning such the law of God is: “But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; or in enmity smite him with his hand, that lie die; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.’’-Num. 35:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>23</sup> Not later than Armageddon Jesus Christ, the revenger of blood, will slay the malicious clergy and their allies. It appears that such men, who have professed to serve God but who have willfully served the Devil, shall receive the severer punishment at the hands of the great Executioner. The Lord gives command to the “six men’’, who representatively stand for the invisible part of the organization under Christ Jesus, to go in with their weapons and slay the willful ones and that without mercy: “And to the others ho said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.’’ (Ezek. 9: 5, 6) The plain declaration of the Lord is that “organized religion’’, which has so greatly defamed his name, and those therein who have participated in the persecution of his faithful people and have defamed God’s name, shall be destroyed without mercy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> Who, then, arc the ones that will escape? It is the people of good will that flee into the city of refuge. They were once associated in some respect with Satan’s organization, but now, by reason of learning of the wickedness thereof, and of God’s loving-kindness, they seek refuge in God’s organization, which organization was pictured by the cities of refuge. They forsake Babylon, that is to say, Satan’s organization, and flee unto God’s organization, taking their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom, and henceforth they must have no sympathy with or give support to the wicked organization, but must remain steadfastly on the side of the Lord and be in full sympathy with his organization and the work he is doing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ELDERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>25</sup> The elders of God’s organization are those who have been brought into the temple and anointed of the Lord, and who are therefore elders in fact, or mature ones in Christ. These shall not shun to declare the truth of and concerning the enemies of God; and this was foreshadowed by the declaration of God’s law in Moab, to wit: “But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and flecth into one of these cities: then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.”—Deut. 19:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>26</sup> The faithful remnant of God’s organization, and who hence arc elders, must not compromise in any way with the deliberate manslayers or persecutors who are of Satan’s organization or try to shield them, nor must they have any sympathy for them as against the execution of God’s vengeance upon them. They not only must be separate themselves from that wicked organization, but must be in full heart accord with God’s determination to execute his vengeance upon them. They must be consistent and pray God that his declared purpose to destroy the wicked shall be carried into operation. Thus they will show their full sympathy and heart devotion to .Jehovah and to his purposes. These faithful ones, therefore, must continue to boldly declare the vengeance of our God, because this is a part of the commission given to his anointed ones.—Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>27</sup> Throughout the land of “Christendom” there arc millions of people of good and honest heart who do not wish to share the guilt of blood innocently shed. Ignorantly, hence unwittingly and unawares, they have been drawn into Satan’s trap and caused to commit many wrongful deeds against others. In God’s law ignorance thereof is an excuse when one turns his heart to righteousness. In order for these to escape, however, they must show their devotion to God and his kingdom upon coming to a knowledge of his provision for the human race. Like the “elders of his [the manslayer’s] city”, they must not safeguard the guilty ones, but must be in accord with the Greater Jehu; and when, like Jehu, he calls for the heads of the sons of the antitypical Ahab crowd they must follow the example of the rulers and elders and deliver up the heads. (2 Ki. 10:1-7) This docs not mean that they participate in the execution of any creature, but it docs mean they must not hesitate to declare the truth when the opportunity comes and must not refrain from doing so in order to secrete someone else. The clergy, especially the Roman Catholic hierarchy, howl and complain that Jehovah’s witnesses attack them. Such is wholly untrue. God lays the obligation upon his people to declare the truth, that others might know of God’s purposes. It is the truth that exposes the wicked,-and the truth is declared for the benefit of those who wish to do right.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> The great Judge, Christ Jesus, is upon his throne at the temple and is dividing the people, and those who desire to be in harmony with God and righteousness must without equivocation or compromise take their stand on the side of the Lord and let it be known that they are for God and his righteous government at all times. The obligation is now upon Jehovah’s witnesses to instruct the Jonadab class in order that those of good will may act intelligently. Those persons of good will and honest heart have been kept in blindness by Satan and his agents, particularly by the clergy, and until they heard the truth about the Lord and his kingdom, and thus they have unwittingly supported the unholy crowd and committed acts of violence to those who are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, as well as to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup> But what shall be said about those who engaged in the &quot;World &quot;War and who took human life in battle, and who afterwards came to a knowledge of the truth, made a full consecration to do the will of God, and devoted themselves to the Lord? Do such have any protection in the cities of refuge? It does not appear from the Scriptures that the cities of refuge have any reference to those who become members of the body of Christ. There does not seem to be any reason why they should. There is a wide distinction between such and those who become of the class known as the ‘millions that will not die’, meaning those people of good will who obey the Lord God now but who are not accepted as a part of the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. Before the building up of Zion the purpose of the gospel’s being preached was to take out from the nations a people for the name of Jehovah. In order to be of those who are thus taken out for the name of Jehovah the sinner must first acknowledge his sin before God, trust in the precious blood of Christ Jesus as his redemptive price, and then unconditionally agree to do the will of God by making a full consecration of himself. It is the will of God that those thus taken out for his name shall die as human creatures but live as spirit creatures. The man who fully consecrates himself to do the will of God, and whose consecration is accepted, is justified by Jehovah by reason of his faith in the blood of Jesus and his obedience to God’s law. All the sins of such a one are atoned for by the blood of Christ. When his consecration is accepted he is justified, and by reason of his justification there results to him the right to live as a human creature; and it is that human life that is sacrificed. Thereupon God brings forth such as his spirit son, and all of his past or inherited sins are wiped out. “For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6: 7-11) Paul was one who unwittingly served as a party to the murder of Stephen, as he stated himself: “And wb.cn the blood of thy martyr Stephen ■was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.” (Acts 22:20) But when Paul learned the truth, and fully consecrated himself to do the will of God through Jesus Christ, his sins were cleansed and wiped out and he was made acceptable unto the Lord. The one who is thus brought forth by Jehovah as his son is a new creature in Christ Jesus; as it is written: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Cor. 5:17) It is such sons of God as are found faithful at the judgment by Christ Jesus at the time of building up of Zion that arc taken into the covenant for the kingdom, and these become a part of the royal organization of God symbolized by a city. (Rev. 21:1,2) All such are under Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, and thereafter must be wholly and entirely obedient to Christ if they would live. (Acts 3:23) It is to such new creatures who live in Christ that the scripture is addressed, to wit: “We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. Jie that lovcth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.”—1 John 3:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>80</sup> The refuge or protection of such is in God’s organization under Christ in his sanctuary, in the secret place of the Most High: “He that dwellcth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortress; my God; in him will I trust.” (Ps. 91:1, 2) These form a part of the city and arc not the ones that flee to it after Zion is budded up. For these followers of Christ Jesus in the temple to gain eternal life they must abide in Christ Jesus, faithful, and perform their obligation. (John 15: 5-8) All such are members of the priesthood under Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>21</sup> Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the building up of Zion those found faithful and brought into the covenant for the kingdom form a part of God’s organization. It was after the covenant of faithfulness, which was made in Moab, that the cities of refuge were set up, and this shows that it was after the taking of the faithful sons of God into the covenant for the kingdom that the cities of refuge anti-typically are set up or, rather, made to apply. Prior to the taking of the faithful remnant into the covenant for the kingdom, there were, and since then have been and are yet people of good will who have unwittingly or unawares violated the everlasting covenant. The period of sacrifice for the taking out of a people for Jehovah’s name must end with the completion of Zion ; but what provision is made for such of good will who now devote themselves to Jehovah God? They are in the world ruled by Satan, and they have no sympathy with his wicked rule, and have separated themselves therefrom. They desire to serve God and to do his will. It is important just now to understand what is Jehovah’s purpose concerning them and what is the obligation laid upon the faithful remnant in connection with the Jonadabs.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>KINGDOM PROCLAMATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A</span><span class="font2">T THE inauguration of God’s government upon earth there must be carried on, according to the Scriptures, an advertising or publicity campaign of great scope. The purpose of this announcement of God’s kingdom, and the manner in which such announcement is now actually being given among the people throughout all the world, are of immediate concern to eveiy person of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The anointed ones of the Lord now on earth are commanded to declare the day of the vengeance of God. (Isa. 61:1,2) The vengeance of Jehovah is not expressed against individuals, but against Satan and his wicked organization by which he oppresses and blinds the people, and against the instruments that he uses for that purpose. Jehovah’s purpose is to destroy Satan’s wicked works and his organization, and he is now having the witness given making known that fact to the nations. For this reason he discloses to those of the temple class what constitutes the Devil’s organization. It is seen to be a powerful and dreadfully wicked organization which the Lord alone can and will destroy. lie lays upon his servants the obligation of declaring his purpose to destroy it. Jesus states that after the good news of the kingdom has been declared to the people there shall come upon the nations of earth a time of trouble the like of which was never known and that it will be the last. That will be the expression of God’s indignation against the wicked one and his system. (Matt. 24:21,22) The period of time from the cessation of hostilities of the World War and to the final trouble is reserved specifically for the giving of the witness of and concerning God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through his prophet Jehovah declares that ho has a controversy with the nations that make up Satan’s organization ami that he will destroy such. Having already ousted Satan from heaven and destroyed his rule there, we may know’ that God will destroy his rule and influence on earth. Such is one of the preliminary works of God's righteous government. (Jer. 25:29-3G) Tn that work of destruction Jesus Christ leads the assault. This he does as the mighty Executive Officer of Jehovah. (I’s. 110:5,6) Christ alone is the symbolic “winepress” that crushes the life out of the evil organization. (Isa. 63: 3-5) The part in this great work that is performed by the faithful followers of Christ on earth is that of process servers. They serve notice by telling the rulers and peoples of earth of Jehovah’s purpose through Christ to destroy the evil organization. (1 John 3:8) Of course, Satan knows that the great fight is approaching, but he is so self-centered that he believes he will win that fight. Knowing that the time is short for him to prepare for it, he hastens to gather the nations and rulers of earth into a condition for the great battle, in which great battle Satan’s organization will fall, never to rise again; and the name of Jehovah God shall be everlastingly exalted.—-liev. 12: 12; 16: 13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The faithful remnant of the followers of Christ Jesus now on earth are ambassadors of God and his King. These are in the world to represent the Lord. To some it may seem to be inconsistent for these ambassadors to be in the world and yet proclaiming the truth concerning what is about to befall the world. It may be argued that ambassadors are in a country only when both countries involved are at peace and that when war is declared the ambassador withdraws; whereas God’s government is not at peace with Satan’s organization. Such is the rule that obtains in the divisions of the government controlled by Satan. Such is not the rule of the Lord. The Scriptures show that the Lord’s ambassadors are sent to the rulers when hostilities exist. Satan’s organization is hostile to God’s organization and God has declared his purpose to destroy Satan’s organization. Christ is God’s Ambassador to bring reconciliation between the people and God because hostilities do exist. The members of the body of Christ are ambassadors participating in that work of reconciliation because the people are hostile to God. In no other way can the words of the apostle Paul be properly understood: “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, Be ye reconciled to God.’’ (2 Cor. 5:19, 20) The ambassadors of the Lord are now in the world but not of it. They are authorized to declare in denunciatory terms that which God’s Word says concerning his purpose of manifesting his indignation against the evil system which Satan has builded up. This system being an oppressor of the people, God will relieve the people therefrom and wills that they shall be so told. Paul spoke of himself as an “ambassador in bonds’’, and his bonds were placed upon him by Satan’s organization. (Eph. 6:20) All the ambassadors of Christ on earth would now be in bonds except that God has put his hand over them and by his power shields them until the work committed to them is done. When that work of proclaiming his name and purposes is done, then God will take the ambassadors away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While these ambassadors of the Lord are in the world they have much tribulation, even as Jesus foretold. (John 16:33) Their tribulation is caused by the opposers of the message they are bringing and the work they are doing. These faithful ones, however, like Paul, “rejoice in tribulation’’ because such is a token to them from God that they are his anointed saints. (Phil. 1:28,29; Rom. 12:12; Acts 14:22) Those of the remnant class have entered into the joy of the Lord because they sec that the time has come for God to vindicate his holy name, to overthrow the oppressor, and to bring peace and righteousness to the earth through his anointed King. When, in A.D 1914, at the end of the long period of waiting, Jesus received the command from his Father to arise and take action against the enemy, that was a time of great joy to Christ the Lord. When he came to his temple in 1918 and found some whom he approved because of their faithfulness, he invited them to enter into his joy. Those who since that time have seen and appreciated that the kingdom is here and that the time has come to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and who continue to love the Lord, have gone forward to their work abounding in the joy of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah God has provided music for the new-born government and his faithful witnesses who delight to sing that music. The Psalms of the Bible are poems set to music. Aside from the Psalms there is very little poetry in existence that is at all worth while. Tiie kingdom or government psalms are addressed to the “Chief Musician’’. It seems clear that the Chief Musician is that section of the anointed class the members of which have entered into the joy of the Lord, who forget self, who are active in showing forth the praises of the Lord, and who logically take instructions from the Psalms and profit thereby. Though all others seem to forsake the Lord, those trust him implicitly and delight to do his will. They sing: “The Lord God is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.’’ (Hab. 3:17-19) The hind is an animal so sure-footed that it can climb to the very steepest part of the mountain crag without fear. Likewise that faithful remnant class composing God’s witnesses are exalted by him to high places; but because of their humility and trust wholly in the Lord, they do not fear and never lose their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These kingdom psalms, or government music, plainly imply that at the beginning of the institution of God’s government there must be carried on an advertising publicity campaign of great scope. The singing thereof is a poetical way of telling that the faithful remnant must be active in representing the kingdom interests on earth and that they will do so with joy, thus proving their love for God and his kingdom. (1 John 5: 3) These poems, provided for the official music of God’s kingdom, aid Jehovah’s witnesses today to a better understanding of the work that the Lord is now having done in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was the established custom, and therefore the law of Israel, that when a king was placed upon a throne, the people, led by the priests (the anointed ones), should clap their hands, thus indicating their joy. Record is made of this in Second Kings 11, verses 9 to 12, for the benefit of those now upon whom the ends of the world have come. (1 Cor. 10:11) With that custom in mind, and applying it to the time when God sets his King upon his holy throne, the poet wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“0 clap your hands, all ye people [particularly God’s people] ; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.’’ A shout denotes confidence in God’s certain victory. And why is this shout given ? ‘ ‘ For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. . . . God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet”; meaning that God has begun his work with the shout of his people. It was the priests that blew the trumpets, foreshadowing the anointed ones proclaiming the glory of his name. “For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.” This shows that the praises are sung by those who have an understanding of God’s purpose. “God sittelh upon the throne of his holiness. The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.” The ‘‘princes” here are willing-hearted ones or volunteers; and therefore, because they have the faith of Abraham, these constitute the faithful remnant class who joyfully declare the praises of Jehovah. The “shields” mentioned here is Christ the King upon his throne, earth’s rightful Ruler. Shields refer to rulers or protectors. (Ps. 47:1-9; see Iios. 4:18, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inargin)</span><span class="font2"> Shielded by the power of earth’s rightful Ruler, Jehovah’s witnesses still on the earth take great delight in faithfully exalting the name of Jehovah and advertising his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SATAN’S COUNTERFEIT OF THE TRUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font2">HE student of prophecy will find that every part of Goil's great organization has been counterfeited and duplicated by Satan, so far as it has been possible. It is apparent that Satan’s purpose has at all times been to defy Jehovah God, mock and ridicule him, bring his name into disrepute and reproach before all creation, and turn all creation away from the great God. A comparison between the two organizations will here be found of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The true should properly be considered first. Almighty God: lie is the Creator, the Father, and, to use the Scriptural term, the “husband” of Zion, and is holy. (Isa. 54:5) Zion is the name of the woman symbolizing God’s organization; it is the mother, the wife that gives birth to that which is holy and is approved by Jehovah. The Seed: It is the anointed of God, Jesus Christ being the Chief thereof, to carry out God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now consider the kai.se. Here we view first Satan, the fai.se and mimic god: He is the creator and father of Babylon; the husband of that old “whore”, as the Scriptures call it; and he is the father of the wicked ones. Babylon: That is the woman symbolizing the Devil’s organization; the mother of Satan’s organization; the wife of Satan; the harlot and “mother of harlots” organization. The seed of Satan and Babylon is Satan’s anointed rulers, that is to say, those whom he authorizes and uses to carry on the visible rule of this wicked organization on earth, and particularly the religious leaders.—John 8:42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the first great prophecy, which was made in the garden of Eden, the Lord Jehovah God said: “And I will put enmity [hatred and hostility] between thee [Satan] and the woman [God’s woman, his organization], and between thy [Satan’s] seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Gen. 3:15) That prophecy must be fulfilled, and is now in course of fulfilment; but the great climax is not yet, but in the future. The two seeds are now developed and made manifest. The hostility not only exists, but is also made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the twelfth chapter of that wonderful book of symbolical pictures and tableaux, The Revelation (12: 3), is this written: “And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.” The other great sign or wonder suugested or implied in this text just quoted is sem at the same time and is the great wonder or sign mentioned in the first verse of the same chapter. The first sign or wonder is the woman ready to give birth to the man child; the second is the great red dragon ready to devour the man child. Both of the signs existed long before, but both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">appeared</span><span class="font2"> at the same time to those who were watching as Jesus had advised them to watch.—Hatt. 24:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These two great signs or wonders are discerned after the opening of the temple in heaven, and are discerned by those who are devoted to Jehovah and who are privileged to be brought into the temple condition. It was in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen that the temple was opened in heaven; and after that time that the true followers of Christ on earth discern' d the wonders or signs. The first duty of those seeing the signs is to call the attention of their fellow Christians thereto, and then to tell these truths to all who have a desire to hear. These, signs are conclusive proof of the presence of the Lord and of the beginning of his kingdom, and of that which opposes his kingdom; and the truth concerning the same becomes of vital importance to everyone who would know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many professed Christians have failed to see cither of the great signs or wonders. They fail to realize that Jehovah God has an organization. They do not see that the Devil has an organization, and therefore think it wrong to say anything about Satan and his organization and the agencies which he uses. Evidently such have been lulled into a sleep or seinieomatose state, and have therefore not been awake to the unfolding of the divine purpose. Jesus prophesied that there would be just such a class of professed Christians on earth at this time, and he counsels such to ‘anoint their eyes with eye salve [of light and truth], that they may see’. (Rev. 3:18) Failing to do so, these are evidently not permitted to enter the temple condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That such a condition of lukewarmness of professed Christians would exist in the very last days of the church’s earthly experience, is made certain, because Jesus the great Prophet of God so stated. It is the hope that the truth here set forth may aid some such lukewarm or sleepy ones to awake and avail themselves of the great privileges that the Lord has afforded them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now it dearly appears to those who are thoroughly awake and devoted to the Lord that the first great sign or wonder described by the Lord Jesus in his prophetic utterances is God’s organization, marking the beginning of the reign of Christ Jesus. It also appears that the other great -wonder or sign is the Devil’s organization, putting forth all its power and manifesting all its viciousness to destroy the “seed” of God’s organization and to bring further reproach upon Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That Satan began the forming of his organization in the day of Nimrod, “the mighty hunter before the Lord,” which was not long after the great flood of Noah’s time, the Scriptures clearly show. God caused the records of Babylon, Egypt and Assyria to be made in his Word for the very purpose of aiding and enlightening his people at the time of the end of the world, where we now are. (Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10;11) Therefore it is now God’s due time for the understanding of the meaning of those records concerning the three great world powers just mentioned. It will not do to say that what is recorded in the Scriptures about these world powers is ancient history with which we have nothing to do. The fact that the sign or wonder is revealed to men only after the Lord builds up Zion in these modern limes is proof that now is the time when God would have his people to carefully examine that ancient history and learn its meaning. That history is made prominent in the divine record concerning Babylon, Egypt and Assyria, manifestly for the purpose of enabling the student to see the hideousness and wickedness of the Devil’s organization at and after the time when the“great red dragon” sign or wonder appears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Devil will make a strong effort to cause many to misunderstand what is here said, because it exposes him and his way of wickedness. Every thoughtful person should expect that very thing. Satan’s methods have ever been fraudulent and marked by lies and deception, and are yet. lie is the deceiver of men, the slanderer of all who try to do right, the opposer of God and all righteousness, and the de-vourcr of everything that would bring honor to Jehovah God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Satan will attempt to induce some to believe that what is here said is said to cause rebellion of the people against the respective governments of earth. That is not the purpose of what we say here. The people could accomplish nothing by rebellion or revolution. The people arc now tied hand and foot and are powerless. They are in complete bondage to the Devil and his organization. There is no possible way for the people to free themselves. As the Israelites were in bondage in Egypt, so now are all the peoples of earth in bondage, to the Devil’s organization. God will set them free in his good way and time, as the Scriptures describe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sole purpose of calling attention to the Devil’s organization is that the people may flee from it and turn themselves wholly to the Lord God so as to have his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The masses of the human race are held in bondage to the Devil’s organization, but they are blind as to what is holding them. Without doubt many of the officials or rulers of the nations of earth honestly desire to see a better condition established amongst the people. Many honest endeavors are put forth by such men to better the government and the people, but God’s time has come when the people and the rulers must know that there is no power that can bring relief and blessings except the power of Almighty God. It is therefore important for us to see and appreciate God’s organization, and at the same time to see and understand the power and wickedness of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The strongest nations on earth today jointly designate? themselves as “Christendom”, because they claim that their religion is the “Christian religion”. Other nations, which make no pretense of worshiping God and Christ, but worship idols, are called “heathen”. There are two great organizations existing, to wit, God’s organization and Satan's organization. To which organization do the nations of the earth today belong? Surely all fair and honest persons would want to determine this question in the right way, because the vital welfare of all the people is involved. It could be of no lasting advantage to anyone to blind himself to the truth. Let the facts be dispassionately and honestly weighed, and then let the question be answered according to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The religion of the nations called “Christendom” is claimed to be Christian. But is it? To be a Christian one must be a true follower of Christ Jesus, and must recognize, serve, worship and obey Jehovah God. lie must take God’s Word as the truth, because the great Prophet Christ Jesus stated that God’s Word is the truth. (John 17:17) The majority of the religious leaders of so-called “Christendom” today deny the truth of the Bible, and deny that the blood of Jesus furnished the purchase price to redeem man from the bondage of sin and death. The very basis of Christianity is the great ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ and his kingdom, both of which are the provision of the great Jehovah God. There is no other means of salvation, as the Word of God plainly states. (Acts 4:12) Every modernist preacher on earth denies that God created man perfect, that he fell because of sin, and that the sacrifice of Jesus was to provide redemption for man ; and yet these men claim to be Christians and are the leaders of the religion of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There cannot be two classes of leaders in God’s organization, because God is not the author of confusion. There are two, and more, classes of leaders in “Christendom”, namely, the Modernist and the Fundamentalist, the Christian Scientists so called, and others. The fundamentalists, without exception, teach that every man has an inherently immortal soul which therefore cannot die, and that when that which is called death ensues, the soul continues to live cither in bliss or in torment. Such is based upon Satan’s lie, and Jesus declared him to be the father of lies. (Gen. 3:4; John 8:44) Every fundamentalist leader denies that the blood of Jesus was shed that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font2">man might have an opportunity for life, and denies that God will give </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font2"> one an opportunity for such relief and the gift of life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus Christ, whose name “Christendom” adopts, restated his Father’s commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” and specifically applied that commandment to all true Christians. He further taught that the man who hates his brother is a murderer. During the World War practically all clergymen, modernists and fundamentalists, taught and instilled into the people the spirit of hatred, and urged them to kill one another. There were two sides in that great war, and the clergymen of ‘' Christendom ” and the principal ones of their flocks were about equally divided on the respective sides; yet all of them urged the killing of their fellow men on the opposite side. Surely this could not be the spirit of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus refused to have anything to do with the politics of the world. He was not of the world, even though he was in it. He overcame the world and told all his followers that they must overcome the world. (John 16:33; 8:23; 18:36-38) The reason he assigned was and is that Satan is the invisible ruler or god of the world. (John 12:31; 14:30) His true disciples, authorized witnesses and representatives of God, told the followers of Jesus that they must keep themselves separate and distinct from the world and devote themselves to telling the truth about God’s King and his righteous kingdom.—2 Cor. 6:17,18; Jas. 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, they taught that he who claims to be the follower of Christ and who makes himself a part or friend of the world is an adulterer spiritually and the enemy of God. (Jas. 4:4; 1 John 2:15) All the clergy of all the denominations, both Catholic and Protestant, participate in worldly politics and diligently seek to control the political clement of the governments of earth called “Christendom”. All of them had to do with the carrying on of the World War. Such course is contrary to God’s organization. It is the practice of Satan’s counterfeit organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>LETTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH HAS KEPT HIS PROMISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Greetings in the name of Jehovah. We have just received your letter of June 11 regarding the Portable Phonograph and 12 records. We feel sure this wiU prove to be a wonderful means of getting the message to the people, and we are today taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain one of these machines, and we arc delighted that the dear Lord is making it possible for us to obtain such an effective weapon; for they are effective weapons, as our report with a Transcription machine will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This report is of the series of the seven lectures given in Harlingen, Texas. This town has always been a church-ridden town, and we found it hard to place much of the literature there. We obtained the Fair park for a place to give the lectures. At the conclusion of the seven lectures with the Transcription machine we had 557 attendance, placed 51 bound books, 233 booklets; and 13 of those in attendance were baptized yesterday, after the last of the series was given. There will be another baptizing in a few weeks, and there will be at least 6 more at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have also started a little study class in Harlingen, using for our study the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font1"> booklet. The attendance at this study will range from 15 to 20. This place is just getting over the effects of the hurricane of last year. Everybody is hard up, and we feel sure this Portable Phonograph, which can be taken into the home where the people can hear, will be a wonderful means of spreading the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dear brother, it is useless for us to try to explain our gratitude to the dear Lord, and also to yourself, for providing us with these means of service. With us Jciiovah has certainly kept his promise as stated in Malachi 3: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We sincerely trust that the Lord will continue to use you; and know, dear brother, we are whole-heartedly with you in this beautiful and wonderful work. To us the name of Jehovah is the most important in the universe, and we rejoice in knowing he will soon vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With love in Jehovah’s name,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">F. B. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sergeant,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> N.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S PROVISION OF GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I finished reading the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation;</span><span class="font1"> my heart is so full of gratitude that I feel I just must express my thanks to the heavenly Father for this another expression of his loving provision of good for those who love him. I also desire to thank you for the gift, which I deeply appreciated. Surely this book is the best yet, and throws a clear light on many points heretofore obscure. After reading </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font1"> surely there is no room for doubt as to what is the full duty of those who are in line for the kingdom, and none of Jehovah’s witnesses will hesitate to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I humbly thank Jehovah for the privilege of service daily. In my several years of pioneer service I have had much joy and many expressions of his loving care over me. Daily I pray for Jehovah to bless and to continue to use you to feed the flock of God with food convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your brother in the King's service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL THANKS TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is Sunday and we are “laying by’’ in the sage brush for a little needed rest. Our territory is in the Cascade mountains, the northeastern corner of California. Not just as young in years as we used to be, but happy and glad to have a little share in kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We want to thank you for the credit of twenty-five dollars for each of us, as given to help defray expenses to the recent Los Angeles convention. This amount was a great help to us. And we wish to say “Thanks’’ for the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, </span><span class="font1">which has revealed so many comforting prophecies to the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know you aro busy in kingdom work constantly, and we wish to speed your work rather than hinder you by asking you to read a long-winded letter of eulogy. But we want to share with you a little surprise letter, i.e., a letter of appreciation. This letter is from a man in Surprise valley and is full of surprises till the signature of the sender. We hope you</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">'•tin. spare time enough to read it, and that you will enclose llua letter in self-addressed envelope; for we would love to bn w- this letter returned to us again. It is like a precious gem toumd in a desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">were on our way to Surprise valley (in Modoc county, California) for the fifth time in the last ten years, when we rwtiuved this good letter from Brother ——. Reminds us of the- ten lepers that were healed by oar Savior: only one relumed to thank him. In this case we render all thanks to Jehovah for his truth and for the blessings and privileges we harm as Jehovah’s witnesses. We are happy to sliare in this Btwwed privilege with you; and may the Lord continue to bless •ath keep you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• • • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr., and Mrs. C. Bodtcher,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dk.zx Friends:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Have been wanting to find out where you were ever since vou. were here last summer. We wanted to see more of you then, butt knew you were busy, and we were also, but here not long ng&lt;r X wrote to the Watch Tower for your address and got it riirtii after you were here. I sure went into action and got all thirteen of Judge Rutherford’s books, also the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Gulden </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Age</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> magazines, and last winter I got the new book </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I’r—j/aration</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the new </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> every one a jewel. I haw bought and given away over 150 of the little booklets:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">100 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and 50 of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eecape to the Kingdom. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">And no man can tell me we haven't been blessed for it</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">You know I told you wo had a mortgage on all our stock to the B.F.C. Well, I sure took that oft in a hurry last fall. What stock we have left, which is a plenty, 45 cattle and 168 sheep, is ours. Our land is still mortgaged to a private party. We have plenty of feed for ours, but this drought is going to be terrible yet. Now the reason I am telling you all this is that if you hadn’t brought us the blessed word of Truth, where would we be now! Crazy, I guess. As it is, and as it has been ever since you were here, we are comforted and simply do not worry. We sure want to see you both again and are sure hoping you can come up this summer. Come here to us if you come, but write anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">We sure can see things coming together now. I must read my books over again. I loaned most of them out and I just simply have to go and get them when I want them. I want to try and do more witnessing as I can. I have been doing some of it on a horse. Our car is laid up, and has been for three years in November. So you can see we have tried to make ends meet and it cannot be done, and now to know the Truth and see what is coming is surely grand. I had never thought of such a thing nor heard of such a thing until you told me last summer, and I tell you, we thank you. We are for Jehovah and his anointed. Bless them alh Let us see you now before long, but write anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely your friend,</span></p>
