<p><span class="font2">Wicked spirit creatures have afflicted the human race for many centuries. It is of the greatest importance that mankind should understand the origin of those wicked creatures, their methods of operation, nnd the power they exercise over the men and nations of the world. It seems the Lord's due time to reveal these truths. The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Angels</span><span class="font2"> gives the Scriptural proof and is now ready to be released to the people. The remnant should study its contents carefully and be diligent to get the booklet into the hands of every person of good will and all who are seeking the truth. The Joimdnbs should join in this witness work and distribution. The climax of the great day of Go&lt;i Almighty is rapidly approaching. ami a knowledge of the truth is essential to all who would receive protection. The booklet will be translated and published in many languages. The Society will supply the demand as rapidly as possible.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE CRUCIBLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“If it be so, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, 0 king. But if not, be it known unto thee, 0 king, that ice will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.’’—Dan. 3:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH permitted his beloved Son to be subjected to the greatest and most severe test to which any creature was ever put, and that test brought much suffering upon Jesus. His suffering was not necessary in order that the ransom price might be provided, but it was necessary for him to suffer that the name of Jehovah might be vindicated. Those who have a pari in the vindication of Jehovah's name must suffer in like manner, even though not to the great extent to which Jesus suffered. (Matt. 10:24-30; John 15:20,21) As we approach now to the day of Armageddon, and hence to the time of the most severe test upon the remnant, let those who are privileged to be in the covenant for the kingdom with Christ Jesus rejoice that they arc permitted to fill up the sufferings that arc left behind for the present time, knowing this, that Jehovah will cause all things to work together for good to those whom he has called to the kingdom and who really love him. (Col. 1:24; Rom. S:2S) Jehovah is fortifying the remnant against that day by giving them information now in advance. It is food convenient for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king represented the power of the ruler; hence at this point he pictures or represents the Devil, who at the present time speaks through his representatives in an effort to ensnare Jehovah’s faithful witnesses: “Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, 0 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not yc serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?’’ (Dan. 3:14) The Devil’s earthly representatives arc his publicity agents, and Satan is the power behind the screen that directs their words and their actions. Before the king Nebuchadnezzar the three faithful Judeans were required to plead to the charge “guilty’’ or “not guilty’’. They did not hesitate to state the truth, because the issue was a simple one, to wit: Whom do you worship and serve? These three faithful Judeans unhesitatingly identified themselves as God’s servants. The Devil and his agents often try to appear to be fair for the effect it may have upon lookers-on, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">307</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">this they do when they sec that such a course would work to their own purpose; hence the three Hebrews were given a chance to reconsider as to whether or not they would bow down before the golden image. Likewise today the Devil causes his visible representatives to say to Jehovah’s witnesses, in substance: “We will give you another chance to say whether or not you want to obey our ordinance. We will let you off this time, but if again wc find you going about worshiping your God wc will give you the limit.’’ Further opportunity is offered that the faithful ones might compromise with the Devil or his organization and thus bring reproach upon the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king would now let those three faithful Hebrews arrive at their own conclusion as to what benefit would result to them by going on with the rest of his organization and thus not putting the rulers to further embarrassment. Doubtless Nebuchadnezzar concluded that these men would not call h's bluff; therefore he said to them: “Now, if ye be ready, that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornel, flute, harp, sackhut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be east the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?” (Dan. 3:15) The king there put it up to those three men as to whether they would follow the instruments of the Devil’s organization or would follow Jehovah’s commandments. It is even so today with the worldly ruling powers that say, in substance, to Jehovah’s witnesses: “If you will cea.-.e going from house to house and calling u[hhi the people and come to us and get a license or a permit, wc might let you go on; but if you do not first obtain a permit or do as the churches do in carrying on jour religion, and if you persist in going from house to house without obeying us, we will certainly run you in.’’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Satan’s earthly agents try to “save their own faces” and to keep Jehovah’s witnesses in ignoram-e of what they really intend to do, but the Lord Ged,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">by his Word, makes it clear to the faithful now, informing them in advance as to what Satan’s hosts, both visible and invisible, will attempt to do against those who serve Jehovah; and, being thus forewarned, the remnant are forearmed, by the grace of God. Satan’s crowd now try to frighten and intimidate Jehovah’s witnesses, but the Lord gives them information so that they may be strengthened to go on, knowing that if they are faithful to Jehovah they will receive his protection. To be sure, Satan’s earthly agents have no fear of Jehovah, since they do not know and serve him, and hence they threaten Jehovah’s witnesses with severe punishment and say to them: “ Who is Jehovah, that he shall deliver you out of our hands ? We will teach you who is running this country, and Jehovah cannot help you.” Thus Satan’s representatives fling defiance in the face of Jehovah God. This is done in an effort to weaken the faith of Jehovah’s witnesses and to break down their integrity toward God. In the same manner Pharaoh defied Jehovah when Moses and Aaron appeared before him. Likewise when liabshakeh, leading Sennacherib’s army, encamped before the walls of Jerusalem, demanded the surrender of the city, he said to the unyielding Jews who were obeying the instructions of Hezekiah: “Hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persnadeth you, saying, The Lotto will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?”—2 Ki. 18:32,33, 35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Let the remnant now keep in mind that all these things were ‘written aforetime for their comfort, tiiat they might have hope’. (Korn. 15:4) All this strongly suggests that just preceding Armageddon, when the Devil’s plan is complete and he feels ready for the attack, he and bis agents will boast and brag as to what they will do to those who take their stand on the side of Jehovah God. They will ridicule Jehovah then as they did in the days of Hezekiah. Now, in advance, Jehovah informs his faithful ones what he will do for those who will maintain their integrity toward him, and this knowledge brings great consolation at the present time to those who are faithfully obeying God’s commandments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“In this day of Jehovah his witnesses must stand firm and must be bold in holding forth the message of the kingdom even as the three Hebrews did before King Nebuchadnezzar. “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-ncgo answered and said to the king, 0 Nebuchadnezzar, we arc not careful [we have no need, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AJf.V.;</span><span class="font3"> we are not accounting it needful, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.]</span><span class="font3"> to answer thee in this matter.” (Dan. 3:16) The language of these three faithful Hebrews shows that they had definitely decided what course they would take and that they were not at all concerned with the threat made against them by Satan's visible agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In other phrase, they said in substance to the king: “We arc for Jehovah, first, last, and all the time, and it is not needful for us to give consideration to what others may say that is contrary to. Jehovah's commandment.” Such is and of necessity must be the attitude of those who are today faithful unto Jehovah God and his kingdom. Jehovah revealed to his people the true meaning of “the higher powers” through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in 1929, and thereafter the faithful have not yielded to the threats of the enemy. They know that Jehovah and Christ Jesus arc “the higher powers”, and will obey them. On July 2G, 1931, the remnant knowingly accepted the new name from Jehovah as his witnesses, and since then there is no reason for them to consider what the enemy Satan and his agents say to them. They are on Jehovah’s side, and his instructions they will obey regardless of all threats or acts of violence made against them. A striking example of this is shown by what has taken place in the state of New Jersey, and particularly in the vicinity of Bergenfield and Plainfield. Time and again Jehovah’s witnesses have been threatened and have been thrown into prisons of those places because they dared preach the gospel of God’s kingdom, and as soon as they get out of prison they go right back to preaching the gospel in the same manner as they had been preaching before the time when they were arrested. During the past three years Jehovah's witnesses have not shunned to declare the whole message of God’s kingdom and the day of the vengeance of our God. Tn every part of the laud called “Christendom” the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses continues to increase with severity; but that does not stop tire witness work in which they are engaged.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The faithful witnesses will obey Jehovah’s commandment Io the very last and will not yield to the enemy nor be deterred by his threats of violence. As the three faithful Hebrews said, so say now the faithful remnant who are Jehovah’s witnesses. 1o wit: “If it be so, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.” (Dan. 3:17) Now is the time, and from this time forward, when the real crucial test of the faithful of God’s witnesses is applied ; and this pressure increases, and as it. increases the faithful must hold fast. The remnant know that Jehovah is all-powerful and that his purpose is certain to be accomplished. To be sure, they do not know what individuals amongst the remnant are going through Armageddon, but they are sure, from the Word of God. that some of the remnant will pass through that great trouble and thereafter perform some service on earth in the name of Jehovah. The Lord began to give his people this assurance, particularly through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of December 15, 1928, page 376, in the article entitled “Ruler Out of Bethlehem”. The purpose of such deliverance is a partial vindication of Jehovah's name. The remnant first began to see timt the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the important issue when the Lord caused the publication of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> in 1929. There the Lord revealed the truth for the comfort of his people, and these truths have given added strength and hope to the remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> In all probability sonic of the remnant will be killed by the enemy at and during Armageddon, and hence the Devil would think that God cannot deliver them. These things do not deter the faithful remnant in the performance of their duty as commanded by the Loid. They are blind to everything except the commandments of Jehovah given through Christ Jesus. Like the three faithful Hebrews, they now say to the opposing enemy, Satan and his agents, to wit: “But if not, be it known unto thee, 0 king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” (Dan. 3: IS) Why does God permit the remnant now to be subjected to so much persecution and suffering? Manifestly it is to prove their integrity to God under the crucial test and thus ho permits them to have a part in the vindication of his name. Immediate deliverance from the fiery furnace of persecution and strife would not answer the false challenge or charge of the Devil, but their holding fast of their integrity toward God and trusting him implicitly eoine what may, even unto the point of a tormenting death, will answer that false and wicked challenge that Satan has hurled into the face of Jehovah. Such faithfulness on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses is an exhibition of devotion to principle and shows that these are not moved by passion. Such is not “character development”, but it is covenantkeeping to the very bitter end. “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.”—Rev. 12: 11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“ As the apostle said, even so now the faithful remnant say to those who demand that they cease bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah, to wit: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge yc.” “We ought to obey God rather than men,” and, by God’s grace, we will obev him. (Acts 4:19; 5: 29) There can be no bowing down by the remnant to Satan or any part of his organization, nor will they compromise by trying to soft-pedal the message of the kingdom toward the enemy organization. It is God’s message and he has commanded that it shall bo delivered, and he will see to it that it is delivered by those who maintain their integrity toward him. The day of his vengeance must be declared, and his witnesses must make the declaration. Let the remnant now gird up the mind and with grim determination and full confidence in Jehovah and his King stand firm, never yielding to the enemy. The fact that Jehovah caused Daniel to make a record concerning those three faithful Hebrew brethren of Daniel is conclusive proof that Jehovah now will permit some of his witnesses to be put into the crucible, that is to say, be subjected to the most severe test, and that those who stand firm and unyielding will have a part in the vindication of the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The firm and determined stand of the three faithful Hebrew men greatly angered the king Nebuchadnezzar; and likewise the firm standing of Jehovah’s witnesses now on the sido of Jehovah God enrages Satan and bis visible mouthpieces on the earth. “Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Ahed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.”—Dan. 3: 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The firm and unyielding attitude of the remnant, and their persistency in giving the testimony to the name of Jehovah, angers the earthly rulers, particularly the clergy, and causes such to openly identify themselves as on Satan’s side. These earthly rulers feel their self-importance, and hence their pride is hurt and their authority challenged when Jehovah’s witnesses will not yield to their demands, and these things cause them to lose all apparent friendliness ami indulgence towards Jehovah's witnesses; and hence earthly rulers, under the influence of Satan, turn to deliberate and open persecution of Jehovah's witnesses. This is proof that such earthly opposition to God’s message is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inspired</span><span class="font3"> by Satan and the demons. Hitler and his official family are, without doubt, under the control of the unseen power of Satan and his wicked allies who are carrying forward a fight against Jehovah’s witnesses. Since the time of Eden the Devil and his wicked hosts that then rebelled with Satan have fought against all who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah God and have tried to maintain their integrity toward him. Now the Lord through his Word specifically' warns the people that their fight is not against flesh and blood, but against that wicked unseen host. (Eph. 6:12) It is Satan and his wicked angels that are pushing the fight and using their earthly representatives to do their bidding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> An ordinary furnace was not sufficient for Nebuchadnezzar rhe, king, but he caused it to be heated seven times more. The firing of the furnace &quot;seven time-; more than it was wont to be heated” shows Satan's determination to bring all his forces under the leadership of Gog to bear against God’s organization to accomplish the destruction of those who stand on the side of Jehovah. Even all the “seven heads” of tiio “great dragon” (Rev. 12:3), meaning all his invisible forces, and all the “ten horns” of the “beast”, moaning his visible earthly representatives, are assembled to take part in the war against the Lord and against his anointed. (Rev. 17:3.12-14) This assembly of all his forces is in order to make it as hot as possible for those who take their stand on the Lord’s side. We therefore may expect persecutions to continue and to increase in severity down to the very time of the battle of Armageddon. But the faithful will not be terrified by such exhibition of wickedness. —Phil. 1:28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Nebuchadnezzar no doubt reasoned like tris: ihat the God of the three Hebrews might be able to deliver them out of an ordinary fire, such as he would put in his furnace to roast an ordinary man, but surely their God would not be able to deliver these men out of such a record-breaking fire as he would now make. He thought to make it impossible for God to deliver those men. lie was determined to prove himself superior to God, and thus to put reproach upon Jehovah’s name, and thereby all the Jews in Babylon would for all time have their faith in God completely crushed. Of course, Satan put those thoughts in the mind of Nebuchadnezzar the king, because he was the one back of the scenes. God permitted the enemy to go to the limit. No creature can make a test so hard but that Jehovah can prove it entirely without effect. It was done so when Elijah made a test by fire before Ahab and made it just as hard as possible by having twelve barrels of water poured over the sacrifice and the trenches all round about the altar filled with water before the fire, came down upon it. (1 Ki. 18:30-35) Such a severe test increases the faith of the creature and brings greater glory to Jehovah manifesting his supreme power. (1 Pet. 1: 7) These things show that the test that will come upon the remnant near the end will be more severe then than at any time past; but let all be assured that Jehovah through Christ Jesus will provide all the needed protection and comfort for his own. Jehovah cannot be defeated; and he will give victory to his faithful ones through Jesus Christ our Lord. —1 Cor. 15:57.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> In keeping with the devilish, practices of all times, the king caused these three faithful Hebrew men to be securely bound, thus to make resistance by them impossible when they were taken to the mouth of the furnace. “And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-ncgo; and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.’’—Dan. 3: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> We have no means of determining just what this binding foreshadowed, but, judging the future by the past, concerning like matters, the suggestion is here made that the binding may foreshadow the stopping of the witness -work by the enemy’s applying force by and through the “strong-arm squad”, and this just before Armageddon. Such a condition would differ from that which obtained in 1918, because at that time the Lord’s “two witnesses” were “killed” and the vindication work was then unfinished, but in this final test the witness of the remnant in giving notice and warning will be completed. Jehovah is directing his own work and is maneuvering the enemy’s forces and will cause all of the enemy and his organization to take a position where they will have to fight, and it is probable that the enemy then will forcibly stop the witness work and the witnesses from further activity for a time. (Joel 3:2,12; Zech. 14:2) All the forces then in line, the attack will begin. Such would be the crowning overt act upon the part of the enemy against Jehovah’s witnesses. Satan’s preparation having reached the completed stage, and knowing that he must now join battle, he makes his supreme challenge to Jehovah by committing the provocative act that causes Jehovah's Commanding Officer, Christ Jesus, to start the final battle. Jehovah’s people are now advised that Gog will lead the forces of Satan and invade the “holy land”, that is, God’s anointed people, for the purpose of destroying the faithful remnant. “And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the [nations shall] know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, 0 Gog, before their eyes.”—Ezek. 38:16; see Vin</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 311.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> To be sure, the clothing of those three Hebrew men bound for the superheated furnace was inflammable and would add more fuel to the flames; lienee they were left clothed when bound. “Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.” (Dan. 3:21) The binding of these three men in this manner furnished opportunity for Jehovah to more fully demonstrate his preserving power. Today in all the nations of so-called “Christendom” the rulers are keeping close watch on Jehovah’s witnesses and they are determined to stop the work of these faithful witnesses. By permitting the enemy to go the limit Jehovah will lit him and his agents thus show their purpose to stop the work'of Jehovah's witnesses and also to destroy the witnesses and thereby to bring further reproach upon the name of the Most High. After all these nations under the leadership of the Devil’s chief ofiicer Gog succeed to the point of stopping the witness work, then doubtless old Gog will cackle, “Now who are the higher powers?” and then the “man of sin” class will wag their heads and say, “I told you so; I knew these witnesses of Jehovah would get themselves into a jam”; and the “man of sin” class, in order<sup>1</sup> to save their own heads, will doubtless say to the enemy’s representatives, “Look at us; we are showing respect to the higher powers of the world.” That will be an exciting moment, because the fight is now about to start; and the remnant will know what is going to be the result, and thus the Lord will give them further strength and comfort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The earthly crowd will be expecting short shrift of Jehovah’s witnesses and all who have taken their stand on Jehovah’s side; but soon Gog will begin to cackle on the other side of his face and then the faces of. all that motley crowd of Satan on earth will turn black. The Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Warrior, will smite the enemy to the dust. “Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, McsLach, and Abed-nego.” (Dan. 3: 22) Armageddon will be no stage play, nor a mere “breakfast affair”, but will be the hottest fight ever known; and so terrible will it be that mam- will ask, “How can any flesh be saved?” (Matt. 24:21,22) The strong-arm squad that bound and carried these three Hebrews to the mouth of the furnace and hurled them into the flames were themselves destroyed in their efforts to destroy the faithful Hebrews; thus showing that the destruction of Satan’s forces at Armageddon is clearly foreshadowed. The action of the superheated furnace consumed the men at the mouth of the furnace; and, without a question of doubt, this was controlled by Jehovah ami as an exhibition of .Jehovah’s power striking back at the king’s mighty men. This is in harmony with Jehovah’s declaration against Satan and bis forces under Gog when be says: “Therefore will I bring forth a fhe from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.”—Ezek. 28:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Mark the power and protecting hand of Jehovah exhibited on the occasion of the easting of the three faithful men into the furnace. The fire destroyed the men who hurled these three Hebrews into the furnace, but those three faithful men of God went right through the Hames without harm’s coining to them. They “fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace”. (Vs. 23) Probably the mob that stood by, led by the Chaldeans or clergy, cried out, “That is their finish.” But they did not know.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king sat by in his royal chair to see the end of the three Hebrew men who had dared disobey his order, just as the Devil will sit by at Armageddon and watch his forces being led by his field marshal Gog and expect to witness the complete clearing out of all those who are on the side of Jehovah. As Nebuchadnezzar was disappointed in seeing the three Hebrews destroyed, so Satan will be greatly chagrined and disappointed at Armageddon: “Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we east three men bovid into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, 0 king.” (Dan. 3: 24) This supports other scriptures which show that Satan will survive until the very last of Armageddon and will witness the complete defeat of his own forces just before he is bound and cast into the bottomless pit. (Rev. 19:20; 20:1,2) As Nebuchadnezzar on that occasion inquired of his officers, so Satan is here represented as speaking to Gog and others of his officers that may have survived up to that time or point in the battle, asking about Jehovah’s witnesses whom he expected to see destroyed: “Didn’t we east three, men bound into the midst of the fire?” Nebuchadnezzar then observed that the men who were cast into the fire were not hurt by the flames of his superheated furnace. “Be answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.” (Dan.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">3:25) The fact that these three faithful Hebrews were not burned does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses may not suffer physical injury at the hands of Satan’s minions, but it does mean that the Lord’s work will not be injured by Satan nor will the integrity of the faithful witnesses be lessened by reason of Satan’s assaults. It will mean that Satan has failed in his design to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Nebuchadnezzar saw the fourth man in the furnace, whereas only three had been cast in, and he said of the fourth man: “[He] is like the Son of God.” According to another translation: Having the appearance “like to a son of the gods”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jioth..')</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah is the only one having sons within the meaning of giving life and organism to creatures. The Lord Jesus was there in that furnace with those three faithful Hebrews and, by the grace of Jehovah, giving protection to them. This shows that Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Field Marshal, at Armageddon will lead the fight and overcome the enemy, and all who are with him ami remain faith! ul to the end will also be overcomers “These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.”—Rev. 17:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Other scriptures contain precious promises to Jehovah’s witnesses in support of this conclusion. Jehovah by his prophet Isaiah wrote: “For 1 am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. . . . Therefore ye are my witnesses, saith [Jehovah], that 1 am God.” (Isa. 43:3, 12) At the battle it will be actually seen that not men are doing the fighting, but it is the Son of Jehovah God, Christ Jesus the great Warrior, who does the fighting, and who vindicates the name of Jehovah, “And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, ami shall go with whirlwinds of the south. The Lord of hosts shall defend them; . . . And the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the Hoek of bis people.” (Zech. 9:14-16) “He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.” (Rs. 91:151 When in the midst of the battle the Lord causes section after section of the Devil’s forces to be destroyed the faithful followers of Christ Jesus will be singing the praises of Jehovah and his great Field Mar.-hal, even as the Israelites sang when God delivered them in times of old. (2 Chron. 20:22-24) These truths, now understood by the grace of God, give great comfort and hope to the remnant, and for which they are exceedingly grateful to the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The scene now changes. Nebuchadnezzar, who pictured regal power and who up to this point stood for or pictured Satan, now no longer pictures Satan. The regal power passes completely out of Satan’s hands at Armageddon and Christ Jesus becomes the absolute ruler. “'Then Nebuchadnezzar came near &lt;o the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth of the midst of the fire.” (Dan. 3:26) Here Nebuchadnezzar pictures the world’s new overlord in whose righteous hand regal power is now placed. Seeing that Nebuchadnezzar is used to make a prophetic picture, that without doubt is the reason why Nebuchadnezzar was not destroyed when his mighty men fell at the mouth of the furnace and were destroyed by the flames thereof. Now, as the prophetic picture appears, Armageddon is done, and the fire of battle has ceased, and Christ Jesus, the great Righteous Ruler, is in complete charge, administering justice to the people. Nebuchadnezzar did not call forth from the furnace the one whom he saw there described as ‘looking like the Son of God’, for the manifest reason that Christ Jesus was the one and now at this point Nebuchadnezzar represents that same one, Christ Jesus himself. Christ the King had proved the integrity of his servants and the supremacy of Jehovah, which he will do at Armageddon. Now, as Nebuchadnezzar called forth the three mon, even so Christ Jesus calls forth the faithful to his service. The coming forth of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego from the midst of the fire pictures the survivors of the remnant who pass through Armageddon and who perform some service on earth thereafter. In the fight at Armageddon Satan’s crowd will all be confounded and put to shame, but the faithful remnant of Jehovah will be saved and will greatly rejoice; and this is further supported by the prophecy of Isaiah 45:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> On another occasion Jehovah caused a similar picture to be made. The Israelites, under the leadership of Moses, were safely delivered from the Red sea. This was by the grace of God, of course. When the Israelites reached the farther shore and beheld the forces of the mighty Pharaoh going down under the waves of the sea, with great gladness and gratitude they raised a song of praise to the name of Jehovah. Even so will the faithful remnant sing the praises of Jehovah when they witness the destruction of the enemy’s forces. ‘‘I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. Jehovah is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God, and I will praise him; my father’s God, and I will exalt him. Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name. Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.” —Ex. 15:1-3,18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Another example of God’s protection and preservation of his faithful servants is that of Jeremiah, who survived Jerusalem’s destruction and who was released from prison and given his freedom, and who thereafter rendered further service to the name and honor of Jehovah.—Jer. 40: 1-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> ’ The end of Armageddon will surely be a time of great rejoicing in heaven, when the victory of Christ Jesus over Satan is complete and the name of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Most High is given its proper place in the mind of every creature that lives. All who survive Armageddon will look with awe and reverence and devotion upon God and his great King, even as those who stood with Nebuchadnezzar no doubt looked with astonishment upon the throe Hebrews brought forth from the furnace. ‘‘And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.” (Dan. 3:27) The governors and captains and counselors, etc., described in the preceding verse, here represented the members of the heavenly court of Christ Jesus. They see the golden image, picturing Satan’s organization, is gone for ever and that Satan and his organization are now completely done for. As there was great rejoicing in heaven when ■ Satan was cast out, so doubtless there will be even greater rejoicing when his organization is completely destroyed. (Rev. 12:12) The three faithful Hebrew witnesses of Jehovah, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, represented those who will be seen rejoicing. Not a hair of their heads was singed; and why? Because, as the Lord has promised his faithful ones, ‘‘the very hairs of your head are all numbered.” In the day of fiery trials Jehovah’s witnesses faithfully perform their service and rejoice therein, giving praise to God for the privilege; and now, at the end of Armageddon, Christ Jesus calls them forth and acknowledges them before his Father even as he promised long ago: ‘‘But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows. Whosoever therefore shall confess me before mon, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.” (Matt. 10:30-32) Satan kindled the fire and heated the furnace, and sent forth Gog as his chief to bring together all of his forces, and heaped fuel upon the flames, the purpose being to ‘cut off the faithful from being a nat'on’; but Satan shall come to an ignominious end, and Jehovah’s witnesses, still wearing their unsoiled and unsinged garments, will for ever proclaim the praises of the Most High.—Ps. 83:4-18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Following Armageddon is the time when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and Ruler of the world, and all this to the glory of Jehovah God. This is pictured in what followed, to wit: ‘‘Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel [Christ Jesus], and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.”—Dan. 3:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> At this point Nebuchadnezzar continues to picture regal power* residing in and exercised by Christ Jesus, who will bless and glorify the name of Jehovah God for his great act of deliverance of the earthly part of his organization, and the complete destruction of the archenemy and his organization. The remnant on earth, together with the Jonadabs, are the people of God who survive Armageddon, and these will bless and praise the name of Jehovah, giving thanks for their deliverance, just as the Israelites sang the song of deliverance under the leadership of Moses on the bunks of the Red sea, as hereinbefore stated. These truths are now revealed by the Lord to the faithful remnant at the temple in order that they might have comfort and hope. Those on Jehovah’s side realize today more than at any time heretofore that they are not fighting against human creatures, but that their fight is against the host of unseen wicked spirits under the chief command of Satan. The faithful therefore follow the commandments of the Lord given through his Word, and hence they don the whole armor of God; and in doing this they show their faith in God and his gracious provision for them.—Eph. 6:10-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>w</sup> Their deliverance will not come by reason of their own efforts, but will come by reason of God’s loving-kindness for them: “The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them that fear him, and dclivereth them.” (Ps. 34: 7) When Armageddon is done these faithful ones will appreciate Jehovah’s provision for them more than they can now possibly appreciate the same, and they will acknowledge Jehovah’s gracious provision for them and will continue to praise his name with songs of joy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The three faithful Hebrew men trusted in God, who, according to the foregoing text, “changed the king’s word.” Another translation renders that part of the text in this manner: “When the word of the king they transgressed.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Ilnth.)</span><span class="font3"> “And had transgressed the king’s word.” (Leeser) This has reference to the king Nebuchadnezzar when he stood for or represented the Devil and the three faithful Hebrews did there ‘change’ his word, or ‘transgress’ it; otherwise they would not have been thrown into the furnace. Even so in this day, the faithful remnant change or challenge the word of Satan and his earthly representatives by boldly declaring that Satan and the earthly rulers, his representatives of the present time, do not constitute the higher powers or supreme authority, but that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the higher powers and that they, as Jehovah’s witnesses, will boldly declare the truth, and that they will obey the word of Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and not that of men. By their bold and fearless stand these witnesses put themselves entirely on God’s side and they put a different face on the “king’s word” as to its power and application. Not for self-gain do the.v do this, but, prompted by their love for God, the faithful remnant now ‘yield their bodies’ to Jehovah, even as the faithful witnesses, the three Hebrews, permitted their bodies to be cast into the fire rather than to deny Jehovah. The faithful now yield their bodies that they might not serve any power<sup>1</sup> that is opposed to Jehovah God; and, in order for this yielding to be acceptable, it must be prompted by love, which is an unselfish devotion to Jehovah: “And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.” —1 Cor. 13:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.ll.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> It was the question of their integrity and devotion toward God that led the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace. It is a question of their maintaining their integrity toward Jehovah God that is the inducing cause that leads up to the battle of Armageddon and the persecution upon the faithful which precedes and accompanies that battle. If such question had not been involved Jehovah could just as easily have demonstrated his power at Eden by there destroying Satan. Jehovah waits till Armageddon to execute Satan and his host of rebels, in order that Jehovah’s witnesses might first declare his name throughout the earth, thereby furnishing them an opportunity to prove their integrity toward God and to prove Satan a liar, and then he exercises his power by destroying Satan’s organization. The integrity of these witnesses involves the word and name of Jehovah, and to those who really love him he gives opportunity to prove their integrity and their love. In goodness toward his children who are now on the earth Jehovah long ago pictured the importance of maintaining integrity toward him by permitting these three Hebrew men to be cast into the fiery furnace and a record thereof to be made and preserved, and this he did to aid and comfort the remnant. Today, when the faithful remnant read the many marvelous things recorded in the .Scriptures they can truly say: ‘These things were written long ago, and are now made known to us in these last days that wc might, while patiently pursuing the way God has marked out for us, be comforted, and that wc might have hope of complete victory through Christ Jesus our Lord.’ (Rom. 15:4) As the remnant read these precious truths from the treasure house of Jehovah they do joyfully and thankfully exclaim: ‘Surely our God is feeding us upon food that is convenient for us; he has spread a feast for us while we are surrounded by the enemy.’ Let the remnant now rtjoiee and confidently and patiently march on to Armageddon. Jehovah will gain for himself the victory by his strong right arm, Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar promulgated a decree; “Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.” (Dan. 3: 29) That decree was against anyone who should become God's enemy, and foreshadows the decree of Christ against those who become Jehovah’s enemy after’ Armageddon. It will then be a serious matter to speak against Jehovah God. Christ Jesus the great King sanctifies Jehovah’s name and promulgates his decree in that behalf, even as he once taught his followers to pray, “Hallowed be thy name.” During the reign of Christ Jesus all who live must render faithful service to Jehovah; and those who refuse will be cut off. (Isa. 65:20; Ps. 145:20) The decree of the king was, “[They] shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill,” At the conclusion of the thousand-year reign of Christ, Satan, Gog, and all of those that deceive and follow Satan shall come forth and be brought together and will speak against Jehovah and his kingdom, and then they shall be “eut in pieces”, that is, killed in no gentle manner, being destroyed in the second death. (Rev. 20:7-10) This is also pictured by the act of Jehu in making the house of Baal a “draught house”, that is, a place of decomposition or rot. (2 Ki. 10:27) “The name of the wicked shall rot.” (Prov. 10:7) The place where the wicked existed, even the very memory thereof, will become foul; but the name of Jehovah is forever clean and holy, and will thus continue without reproach: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. Isa. 66:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> “There is no other god that can deliver after this sort,” said the decree of the king. Jehovah’s unmatched power of deliverance at Armageddon will prove his supremacy and that nothing can successfully resist his power. Now it is seen that the crucial test must come just before and at Armageddon, and in that test the faithful have the assurance that almighty power will be used in their behalf. (Deut. 33:27) Jehovah will make it plain to his people now that the only place of safety is in his organization. Into this he has brought his anointed ones, and now their loyalty and fidelity to him is permitted to be tested, and in his loving-kindness he gives to the anointed advance information concerning their protection and deliverance, that they may remain firm and steadfast on his side during the fiery test. Such evidence brings great comfort to the remnant and enables them to patiently pursue the course which is now set before them. The Jonadab class, having taken their stand on the side of Jehovah, may also be subjected to some severe trials, but they too will find protection and safety only by remaining true and faithful to God and his organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Ilananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, the Hebrew names of those three men cast into the furnace, and whose Babylonish names were Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, wore without doubt used to foreshadow those of the faithful remnant on earth who maintain their integrity toward God in the day of crucial trial just preceding and at Armageddon. The picture there made shows Jehovah's continued favor to those who remain faithful and true to him: “Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.” (Vs. 30) That promotion of the three Hebrews suggests further privileges of service that God will give to his faithful remnant on the earth immediately following Armageddon. That service, to be sure, will be temporary, but it seems reasonable that God would have some service performed on earth by his faithful remnant at the beginning of the reconstruction work in connection with those faithful men of old who shall become the visible governors on earth. It will be a great privilege to personally meet these new governors at that time and have some communion, fellowship and service with them. That will be a happy time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> That the promotion of the three faithful Hebrews foreshadowed further service on earth for the remnant after Armageddon is supported by what came to pa.-s on Mordecai, who was advanced to a position of unusual honor in the realm of the king in his time. “For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.” (Esther 10:3; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L‘reservation,</span><span class="font3"> page 166) Probably Mordecai and the three faithful Hebrews together with Daniel will he among those who are resurrected and who meet with the faithful remnant on earth immediately following Armageddon and who participate in the work of speaking peace to the people, and directing them in the way of peace and prosperity, all of which they will do, to be sure, under the direction of Christ Jesus, the great King. All of that shall be done to the praise and glory of Jehovah God. The temple work on earth after Armageddon will be followed by a change of the remnant from human to spirit organism and to the realm of far greater opportunities of service to the Most High. Paul must have had a vision of these things when, moved by the holy spirit, he wrote to his brethren in Christ, to wit: “For our light afilietion, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but- at the things which are not seen: for the things which are, seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”—2 Cor. 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Seeing the great and crucial test that must come to those who remain true to the end, the apostle, under inspiration of the holy.spirit, also said: “For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 8:38,39) Such faithful ones will participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>AN ASSYRIA IN MODERN STYLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font3">NCIENT Assyria was a powerful political organization, with the political rulers in the van. The great power, however, was really exercised by the commercial interests. The political power or representative was in fact the spokesman for the commercial power. Great military organizations were formed and employed to enforce the decrees of the rulers. The Devil’s religion furnished the camouflage for the bloody and cruel operations of that organization. This was done, as the prophet Nahum (3:4) says, “because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Christendom,” so called, is modern Assyria, corresponding so exactly that it seems certain that God caused the record of ancient Assyria to be made prophetically foretelling the condition on earth at the present time. Today the politicians of the nations of earth are in the van and are speaking great swelling words of their ability to adjust the difficulties of the world and to establish a satisfactory condition. The power behind these political rulers and spokesmen is the great commercial factors of the world. It is the latter that really provide the means for the mighty military machines to enforce the decrees of the rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the political and financial element of ancient Assyria adopted the Devil religion of that time, even so the religious element of “Christendom” today ably supports the political and financial factors in world policies. Catholics and Protestants, Jewish rabbis and all other “approved” religionists, join together in extolling the virtues of the modern ruling powers, and boast of the ability to establish peace on earth and good will toward men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ancient Assyria was a “bloody” organization. (Nah. 3:1) There is more human blood properly charged up to modern Assyria, otherwise called “Christendom”, than to any other period of the world’s history. In the World War millions of people poured out their lifeblood, and many more millions have been the prey of the great military powers of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ancient Assyria was, according to the prophet’s words (Nah. 3:1), “full of lies and robbery.” The sixteen years immediately following the World War have been made prominent by the clivers fraudulent and false schemes to exploit and rob the people. The farmer has been exploited and robbed by schemes of the financiers, in which the other two ruling factors have rendered aid in wrongdoing. The burden of taxation has been greatly increased, and many persons have lost their homes and lands by reason of exorbitant and unreasonable tax burdens placed against their property for public improvements. Public officials have become the bosses of the people instead of being servants of the people. The great financiers name the political candidates and permit the people to go through the form of voting for them, and then elect those whom the financial power desires. This is particularly true in America. The great financial institutions control the food and raiment supply that the people must have for their maintenance and support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Material wealth was never so great as it. is in modern “Christendom”, but this wealth is held by a few. Every nation is bristling with guns, warships, aircraft and high explosives, and other means for the destruction of human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The political rulers are making peace pacts and thereby claiming that they will outlaw war, while at the same time every nation of “Christendom” is making greater preparations for war than at any time past. In this policy the political clement is strongly supported by the commercial and the religious element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The religious clement of “Christendom”, while claiming to follow Christ, deny his second coming and his kingdom, and refuse to hear and obey the Word of God. The clergy and religious leaders are proud, haughty, boasters, false accusers of those who serve God, and despisers of all who diligently seek to tell the people the truth in the name of the Lord God. Being a factor of Satan’s organization, the religionists are supported by the other ruling factors because the latter believe it expedient for them so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Paul wrote a prophecy which is in this very day coming to pass, even as he said: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lover's of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the Scriptures it is now clear that the three ancient world powers, namely, Babylon, Egypt, and Assyria, emphasize the three elements of Satan’s visible organization. With Egypt the commercial power was the greatest; with Assyria the political power excelled; with Babylon the ecclesiastical element was to the fore. Thereafter these three ruling elements, namely, the political, financial, and religious, were manifested in all succeeding world powers. Medo-Persia, Greece and Home followed in the order named. Each of those world powers practiced the Devil religion. The religion of ancient Home was called pagan. In the course of time the stronger political rulers of Rome adopted the “Christian religion” and carried into that organization, so formed, many of the ceremonies practiced by the pagans. Rome became a great military power, and her commercial and political and religious interests walked hand in hand in oppressing the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then came the British Empire (including America) as a mighty world power, and in this the three elements, commercial, political and religious, have formed the ruling factors, and continue to rule. It too has become a tremendous commercial power and a great and cruel military^ power, and the religionists form a part of the government. Surely it could not be said that any of these world powers is any part of God’s organization. Since there are but two great organizations, namely, God’s organization and Satan’s organization, this empire must of necessity be of Satan's organization. Exactly the same is true concerning America, where the three elements of Satan’s organization rule the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The World War produced a condition making possible the formation of the eighth world power, to wit, the League of Nations, and that was foretold in prophecy. (Isa. 8: 9,10; Rev. 17: 9,11) That alliance or pact was formed by the political clement, aided and supported by the financial and military factors, and fully supported and approved by the religionists of “Christendom”. The latter openly declared in the year 1919 that 'the League of Nations constitutes God’s kingdom on earth’ and substitutes for it. Can it be honestly contended that the League of Nations constitutes any part of God’s organization? If not, then certainly it is of Satan’s organization. Yet now the League of Nations, Inc., organized in America, makes appeal for America’s entry into the League and, referring to the League, says: “In a world as dark as this, why blow out the only light there is?” thus denying the King, Christ Jesus, who said: “I am the light of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the year 1914 Christ Jesus was placed upon his throne by Jehovah God. That same year the World War began, and during that war the hatred of combined “Christendom” was made manifest against ail who sincerely served Jehovah God. The great Prophet of God foretold that condition when he said: “And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.”— Matt. 24: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was in A.D. 1918 that all the nations of “Christendom” involved in the World War openly expressed and manifested a hatred against those who insisted on serving God and telling the people of his coming kingdom for their blessing. These humble followers of Christ were haled into court, were tried upon false charges and perjured testimony, and were wrongfully convicted. Many were imprisoned, others beaten, and others killed. They were thrown into military prisons and grossly illtreated because they humbly asked the privilege to serve God and tell his Word of truth and obey his injunction not to kill. Such hatred could have been' expressed only by Satan’s organization and instigated by Satan himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ‘seed of Satan’ and the ‘seed of the woman’, which God had foretold would be at enmity with each other, were at that time brought forth and made manifest, and Jehovah said that there would be enmity between them, and that the ‘seed of Satan would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman’. (Gen. 3:15) Christ is the ‘seed of the woman’, and his last faithful followers on earth constitute the “feet of him”, including the heel. (Isa. 52: 7) That prophecy long ago uttered began to have its fulfilment in the year 1918. Since then the two great signs in heaven have appeared, namely, the sign of God’s organization (his “woman”) and the sign of the Devil’s organization (the “great red dragon”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The latter great “wonder” or sign, which appeared after 1918 to those who by the grace of God have been enabled to see heavenly things, is Satan’s cruel, blood-guilty organization standing ready to devour the Kingdom of God, represented by the “man child” which was born to God’s “woman” or organization in A.D. 1914. (Rev. 12:1-4) It is well known to all that the clergy and religious leaders of “Christendom”, so called, hate, and violently oppose those who insist on telling the people that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, that his kingdom is here, that Jehovah has set him upon his throne, and that shortly he will establish a righteous government and destroy all wickedness. The Devil bates those who faithfully represent Jehovah, and seeks to devour them; and the clergy and religious leaders of “Christendom” also hate them, because such clergy and leaders do the will of their father whose children or “seed” they are.—John 8:42,44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ancient Babylon overthrew Assyria and absorbed it. Satan has made “Christendom” a part of Babylon which is his organization, and therefore the name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font3"> applies to “Christendom” because it is of Satan’s organization. Through the false religionists of Satan’s organization, the political and commercial rulers of earth have been drawn into that wicked system. The Lord makes it evident that they have been deceived, because he says that in his due time these shall awake to the truth, in a measure at least, and rid themselves of the vile religious system.—Rev. 17:12,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to the World War the moral conditions of the earth were bad enough, but all will agree that since the World War the moral degeneracy is far worse. There is great corruption in public official places. The exploiting of the people is boldly carried on; the public press is full of accounts of crime and scandal. Even the vice among young students has become such that it is appalling and causing great concern to parents. Many honest persons joined in the effort to prohibit the manufacture and use of intoxicating liquors, believing that in so doing they would aid the moral status of the people. The facts show that the Devil seized upon this condition to increase immorality and debauchery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to the World War it was thought to be wrong for men to indulge in the use of tobacco and liquor. Since the war women use both tobacco and liquor, many even more freely than men, and this is extended even to young girls and boys in the public schools. Because of these alarming conditions many good people are now seeking earnestly to find the remedy. There must be a reason for this terrible condition. There is a reason, and the Lord God’s great Prophet assigned that reason, and it is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In A.D. 1914 Jehovah placed his King upon his throne. (Ps. 2:6) There followed a war in heaven, with Christ Jesus and his angels on one side against Satan and his angels on the other side, which war resulted in the casting of Satan out of heaven. (Rev. 12:7-9) Then it is recorded that, because Satan was east out of heaven, there was great rejoicing; and at the same time it was announced: “Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.” (Rev. 12:10) Then says the prophet of God: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12:12) Thus the prophecy shows that the Devil is now devoting his entire attention to the things of this earth. The “inhabitants of the earth” are those who control the affairs of the earth; and, in fulfilment of this prophecy, at this time there is great perplexity and distress amongst those who do rule, and they are unable to ascertain the reason why. (Luke 21:26) The “sea” in this prophecy represents the masses of humanity who are alienated from God and exploited by the ruling powers, and the condition of whom groves worse day by day. This explains the reason wlqv there has been such a great moral degeneracy during the past ten years and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evidence is conclusive that Satan’s organization is now in control of'the affairs of earth. The great Prophet of God foretold this condition, and it has now come to pass. Carrying out his well laid plan Satan is now desperately trying to turn all the peoples of earth away from Jehovah God and to plunge all humanity into the depths of wickedness. Ue knows that the climax is at hand: hence his desperate deeds of corruption and debauchery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Politicians and commercial giants may try to reform the conditions; the clergy may talk of bringing about ideal conditions on earth; and all together they may make peace pacts and declare that they will bring about lasting peace, but the joint efforts of all will fail. There is no power on earth now that is able to remedy earth’s evils. Satan’s organization is in control, and the people’s hands are shackled. There are many people of good will, outside of the church denominations, who by their combined efforts will try to remedy present conditions; but they cannot. There </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> a remedy, and it is complete. It is the only remedy; and it is of much vital importance that the peoples of the nations of earth now be given an opportunity to know what that remedy is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">give such information is the very purpose of the publicity work</span><span class="font3"> of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is of vital importance that the people know the cause of the evil, before they can appreciate how the evil can be eradicated. When we see what constitutes Satan’s organization, how cruel, wicked, harsh, bloody, immoral and powerful it is, then we can begin to see the necessity of a greater power than it to destroy it. At once it becomes apparent that no human powers could accomplish this end. When we see also that the so-called “Christian religion” or “organized Christianity” upholds, aids and supports in carrying on this devilish and oppressive system, then we may know that “organized Christianity”, so called, is not God’s religion, but the religion of the Devil; and we may know it is a part of the Devil’s organization. It is therefore apparent why the clergy and religious leaders of today oppose the truth that is being promulgated by a company of humble Christians who are generally known as witnesses of Jehovah God.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>PLACE OF THE SIN-ATONEMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HROUGH the prophet Moses at Mount Sinai in Arabia Jehovah God issued a command and set of instructions to the Jewish people to build a sacred structure, “the tabernacle of the congregation.” “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, . . . and let them make me a sanctuary: that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, . . . even so shall ye make it.”— Ex. 25:1,8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The tabernacle may be properly described as a house constructed of boards set on end, in sockets of silver, and fastened together and then covered or overlaid with gold; and over this house of wood was stretched a tent or covering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The measurements of the tabernacle are in cubits. There was a cubit of twenty-one inches measured by six handbreadths at three and one-half inches to the handbreadth. The prophet Ezekiel mentions a cubit of the altar seen in his vision as “the cubit and an hand breadth”. The weight of the evidence, however, seems to favor the conclusion that the tabernacle structure was built and measured according to the eighteen-inch cubit and hence was fifteen feet wide, fifteen feet high, and forty-five feet in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were two rooms or compartments of the tabernacle, divided by a heavy curtain or veil. The one farthest from the entrance, and on the west side, is called the “holiest of all”, and was fifteen feet long, fifteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high. The other compartment was thirty feet in length, fifteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high, and is called “the holy”. The veil that separated the holy from the most holj' was hung upon four pillars of shittim wood, which were overlaid with gold. This veil was made of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine twined linen, with figures of the cherubim beautifully and cunningly interwoven therein.—Ex. 26:31,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The way or entrance into the holy is called the door of the tent. This was made of cloth or curtains of blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen wrought with needlework, hung over five pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold.—Ex. 26: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Paul gives a description of the furnishings of the tabernacle, saying: “For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary. And after the second vail. the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; and over itthecherubimsof glory shadowing the racrey seat; of which wo cannot now speak particularly.”—Heb. 9: 2-5; Ex. 40:19-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The tabernacle was the place of meeting between God and the Israelites; and this was manifested by the supernatural light which appeared in the “holiest of all”, between the cherubim, and which represented the divine presence. There was no other light in the most holy. In the holy or first compartment was a candlestick, which was kept lighted; and it was the only light therein. The heavy cloth covering of the tabernacle or tent excluded all light from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The tabernacle was surrounded by a yard or court. This was seventy-five feet wide by one hundred and fifty feet in length, and was formed by a linen curtain round about, suspended from silver hooks fastened in the tops of wooden posts, which posts were set in sockets of copper. It was braced with cords fastened to pins. Tiie tabernacle tent was braced in the same manner. This court was not a part of the tabernacle, but surrounded it, and was used in connection with the tabernacle. It was called ‘ ‘ the court of the tabernacle”. The entrance thereto was on the east and was designated “the gate”. This was made of white linen interwoven with blue, purple, and scarlet.—Ex. 27: 9-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inside the court and before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation was placed the altar upon which was burned the sacrifice. With the altar were the various firepans, fleshhooks, and other necessary utensils. This altar was made of wood and covered with copper, and was known as the brazen altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Between the brazen altar and the door of the tent of the congregation was placed the laver. (Ex. 40: 5-7,29, 30) The laver was made of copper; and in it was placed water for Moses, Aaron the priest, and his sons to wash their hands and feet thereat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures frequently use the expression, “before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.” It is quite certain from the Scriptures that the “door” always means the entryway into the tabernacle proper, and never the entrance-way into the court. The court was relatively unimportant in the eyes of the Jews; for they had free access to it on all days except the atonement day. (Lev. 1:3; 12:6; Num. 6:13-18) They were particularly concerned about the tabernacle, because this was the meeting-place between them and Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the scripture which describes the people of Israel as being gathered together “before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation”, the reference is evidently to the assemblage of the people to the east of that sacred structure, instead of being scattered about it on all sides ns they would Ire if in their tents regularly occupied by them. It seems also quite evident that the gateway or entrance into the court was lifted or left open on such occasions, so that the tabernacle structure was in full view of the representative men who stood before the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the ground within the enclosure of the court hangings, including, of course, the ground upon which the tabernacle was situated, was holy ground. This was particularly true at the time of the ceremonies of the atonement day, once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Israelites were encamped about the tabernacle in regular order. This was because of God’s command. “And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father’s house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.”—Num. 2:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The camp of the tribe of Judah had the position of favor on the east side, toward the rising of the sun. Looking toward the tabernacle enclosure, the tribes of Zebulun and Issaehar were respectively on the left and the right of Judah on the cast side. On the north were the tribes of Dan, Asher and Naphtali; on the west, Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh; on the south, Reuben, Gad, and .Simeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The families of the tribe of Levi were given preferential positions near to the tabernacle. The family of Gershon pitched on the west side of the tabernacle enclosure; on the north were the Merarik-s; while on the south were the sons of Kohath located. .Moses and Aaron were grandsons of Kohath; and they and Aaron's sons were stationed immediately to the cast of the tabernacle entrance, because they were separated from their brethren, by special anointing with the holy oil, to do the work of sacrifice, particularly the atonement-day sacrifices which constituted the special sin-offerings.—Num. 3:14-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah caused a priesthood to be selected, anointed and installed in connection with the tabernacle service. A priest is an official servant of Jehovah God. In organizations made by men priests are often appointed by men, or by themselves, and use their office for a selfish purpose, sometimes for commercial purposes. Oftentimes a priesthood of Israel degenerated into that. But such was not the purpose of Jehovah God. No man has authority to take such honor unto himself. The apostle Paul writes to this effect, saying: “And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.” (Jlcb. 5:4) The priest used in connection with the tabernacle service was the servant of Jehovah God. He performed the duties the Lord assigned unto him. God's law required him to he selected from the tribe of Levi. Aaron was the first high priest. Ills sons were priests under him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s instructions to Moses were these: “And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, ami sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office; for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”—Ex. 40:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The anointing of the priesthood and the garments with which they Were clothed all symbolically testified that they were officiallj’ the designated servants of -Jehovah. They were formally inaugurated or installed into office; and on that occasion all of the congregation were gathered together before the door of the tabernacle; and tiien Moses informed the people what the Lord had commanded him to do with reference to installing the priesthood. (Lev. 8:2-5) Then Moses proceeded to consecrate and inaugurate the priests, as described in the book of Leviticus, the eighth chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this ceremony it is important to notice that the anointing oil was poured upon the head of Aaron but not upon his sons. This testifies that Aaron was the head or high priest, and that his sons were underpriests. Together they represent or picture the new creation of God, both the Head and body thereof, in the course of development, and while on the earth. Not only were the priests officially anointed to serve Jehovah in an official capacity, but the service which was performed in connection with the consecration and institution of the priesthood foreshadowed that the ones whom they represented must enter into a covenant with Jehovah, be wholly and unreservedly devoted to him, and serve him in obedience to his commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are many pictures and details in connection with the building of the tabernacle, the inauguration of the priesthood, and the sacrifice; but the one which is particularly germane to the question of the sin-offering in behalf of mankind was that which took place upon the day of atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah gave command that the tenth day of the seventh month of each year should be a day of atonement for the Jewish nation. “For,” said the Lord, “on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” (Lev. 16:30) On that day the priest who had been anointed and consecrated to serve in the priest’s office must be clothed with the linen garments. These may be properly designated as the garments for sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whatever assistance or service the underpricsts rendered, the command of Jehovah was positive that the high priest alone had access to “the holiest of all” on the day of atonement. Even the high prie t mibt not enter “the holiest of all” on that day except in exact compliance with the prescribed law. If he failed to comply with the law the penalty was death. (Lev. 16: 2) The strict observance of God’s command in this connection indicates the great importance of the picture about to be made. Jehovah used Moses to instruct Aaron, the high priest, what he should do on this important occasion.—Lev. 16:3-5.</span></p>
