<p><span class="font9">OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font5"> RIGHTEOUS GOVERNMENT on earth, administered for the general welfare of the people, has for centuries been the desire of honest persons. In obedience to the commandment of Jesus Christ his faithful followers for nineteen centuries have prayed for the coming of such a government that the will of God might be done on earth even as it is done in heaven. Centuries before the coming of Jesus to earth men who believed in and served Jehovah God looked forward with confidence to the time when there would be a righteous rule on the earth. Their hope was based upon the promise Jehovah made to Abraham, the father of the faithful, that he would in due time raise up a seed that would rule the world in righteousness and by and through which seed all the families and nations of the earth shall have an opportunity for lasting blessings.—Gen. 22:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth to give testimony of and concerning the purpose of God and to redeem the human race. It was in the year (A.D ) 33 that Jesus Christ began his ministry, preaching to his hearers: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand”; meaning that Jesus himself was God’s anointed King and had begun his work amongst men according to the will of the Most High. Jesus gathered round him faithful men and taught them and used them as witnesses for Jehovah. lie strongly impiessed upon their minds the fact that he must die and be raised from</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the dead in order that mankind might have the opportunity to live, and that he must go away to heaven and receive from Jehovah the authority for his kingdom or rule of the world. He further informed his disciples that in God’s due time he, Jesus, would come again and receive unto himself those whom he found faithful and that then he would begin his reign as the world’s ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Portions of the Bible were written by the faithful apostles of Jesus Christ, and this they did under the inspiration and direction of the holy spirit. That which, in the writings of the apostles, is emphasized above all things else is the fact that Christ Jesus the King shall come again and establish Jehovah God’s kingdom and carry out the purposes of the Most High, that the peoples of earth may be blessed. It was the apostle Paul who identified Christ Jesus as the seed of Abraham according to the promise which Jehovah made to Abraham long centuries ago. (Gal. 3:16-29) Thus the promises of Jehovah set forth in the Old Testament are directly connected with the truths in the New Testament, and this proves that the Old Testament and the New Testament constitute the Word of God given to man for his direction in the course of righteousness and that it is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostles were informed that from the time of the resurrection of Christ Jesus and his ascension into heaven until his coming again to set up the kingdom or government would be a long period, during which men must wait. What was to be done in that long interval of waiting? The apostles and other men of mature mind met together at Jerusalem to consider this very matter. (Acts 15:6) They knew that God had dealt with the Jews as his chosen people and that because of unfaithfulness of the majority of that peo-pie God had removed his favor from them as a nation, but that his favor still continued toward the faithful individuals of that nation. They also saw that honest seekers for the truth who were not Jews were receiving God’s favor. Some of these faithful men at the convention above mentioned made known to their brethren that ‘God had wrought miracles among the Gentiles [nations] ’ by giving them the truth. The Lord had especially directed Peter to take the gospel to Cornelius and other Gentiles. (Acts 10: 1-48) Thus they discerned that God was no respecter of persons but now opportunity should be given to non-Jews to become followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostles then considered the words of the prophecy of Jehovah, spoken by Amos, which disclosed Jehovah’s purpose to take out from the nations a people to be associated with Christ Jesus in his kingdom and that in due time Christ Jesus would come again, receive these faithful ones to himself, and set up his righteous government, which government or kingdom was foreshadowed by the reign of King David. (Acts 15:14-18, Amos 9:11,12) The Lord therefore revealed to the apostles that the long period of time of waiting, from the exaltation of Christ Jesus to heaven to the time of his coming again, would be employed in teaching or preaching to the people of and concerning the Kingdom; and this the apostles proceeded to do. This preaching of the gospel has been for the purpose of bearing witness to Jehovah’s kingdom and for the taking out a people for his name. All those persons so selected from the world and who continue faithful to God and Christ Jesus must bear witness to the truth. (John 18:37) The apostles stressed the fact that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus would look with eagerness for the coming of the Lord again and that those who remained faithful and true to God would love the appearing of Christ Jesus, and that such would then receive their reward, to wit, the crown of life, that is, the highest element of life. That would mean that such faithful ones would be made a part of the Kingdom or righteous government.—2 Tim. 4:7, 8, Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With these great truths ever before those who love and serve Jehovah God and Christ Jesus it can readily be seen that such faithful ones would eagerly look for the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom. It was about the year 1872 (A.D.) that a small company of earnest and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, while studying the Scriptures and comparing these with events coming to pass, saw evidence that the Lord was giving special attention to those on earth, and that the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom was imminent. This little company of faithful Christians continued to grow in numbers and in knowledge of the precious things which are found in the Word of God. Shortly thereafter they formed themselves into a Society for more systematic study and teaching of the Word of God. Living on earth and in a nation that has laws for the holding and control of property, both real and personal, and desiring that their organization should perpetuate its work and activity without depending upon the earthly existence of any particular person, this little company of faithful followers of Christ Jesus decided to form a corporation, which corporation should have the management and control of the property and holdings and direct the activities of those who would continue faithful to God and who were looking for his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1884 these followers of Christ Jesus formed a corporation under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, which was then given the name Zion’s Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. The word “Zion ” is one of the names which Jehovah God has given his capital organization and frequently appears in the Bible. The word “Zion” appearing in the corporate name had no reference to or connection with the Jewish organization which is called “Zionism”. Afterwards the name of the above-mentioned corporation was, by the law of the State of Pennsylvania and order of court, changed to that of Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society; and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth have continued that name of their corporation to this day. At no time has any Jew been connected with or supported the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Merely for convenience and to comply with the laws of the land, and to further the interest of its work, the Society organized the Peoples Pulpit Association, in 1909, under the membership corporation law of the State of New York. For the same reason the International Bible Students Association was organized, in 1914, under the laws of Great Britain. These three corporations are really one, and they are all directed by the same officers and have possession and control of the property of the Society. By the word “Society” is meant the united company of faithful men and women now on earth who are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ and who are, by His grace, carrying forward the work of the Lord in the earth. No one of these three corporations above named has any capital stock. They pay no dividends to any person, and no person receives any pecuniary profit therefrom. They are wholly and entirely devoted to carrying forward the work of the Society, which is the preaching or making known to the people the good news that Jehovah’s time is at hand for the establishment of his kingdom under Christ, and the truths kindred thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These statements of fact are here made for the information of any and all honest persons who desire to know what is the purpose of the Society and the corporations that carry forward its work. Misinformed persons, who have been misled and deceived by the willful enemy of God and his kingdom, have been induced to believe that the Society and the corporations above mentioned are selfish, political organizations, operating in connection with other selfish, political organizations for the overthrow of present governments. Such wieked falsehoods proceed from the Devil, who at all times has opposed every one who serves Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every country of the world where there is an anti-Jewish sentiment the malicious falsehood is circulated among the people that our Society and its corporations are financed by commercial Jews. That is also a malicious lie originating with Satan and carried forward by his earthly representatives. In countries where socialism and communism are threatened the enemies charge the Society and its supporters with being in league with socialists and communists for the overthrow of the government; which is also a malicious lie emanating from Satan and carried forward by his earthly representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Society and the three corporations named herein have at all times kept completely separate and apart from all political parties or affiliations. We have no part in the political affairs of this world, for the reason that our devotion is absolutely and completely to God and his kingdom under Christ, for which kingdom faithful men and women have been hoping and praying for the past nineteen hundred years. It would be foolish and contrary to God’s will for us to participate in or be associated with any political organization. Our Society and its corporations have never received one cent of financial support from Jews. From the very beginning of the Society until the present day its money to carry forward its work has come from contributions made by humble men and women who have a desire to make known the truth of and concerning Jehovah God’s provision for the blessings of the peoples of the earth. The work of the Society is done according to the will of Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and he puts in the hearts of faithful men and women the desire to supply the money to carry forward his work. All the money and all the property of the earth belong to him, and he can see to it, and does see to it, that the money which is necessary is supplied for his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who love God, and who believe and rely upon his Word as set forth in the Bible, plainly see and clearly understand that Satan the Devil is the arch enemy of God and the opposer of all true followers of Christ Jesus. It was Satan the Devil who at the very beginning of human history challenged Jehovah God to put on earth men who would remain faithful and true to God. Satan declared his ability to cause all men to curse God and turn away from him. That raised the issue, which Jehovah accepted, and he has permitted or suffered Satan to do all within his power to make proof of his wicked challenge, Jehovah biding his own due time to vindicate his great name and to completely destroy Satan and his wicked organization. The great time of climax has arrived, and hence the strenuous witness in the earth and the opposition thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To carry out his wicked challenge Satan commercialized the human race and has caused his agents on earth to deal in human flesh and blood. He is the one who put in the mind of man the greedy love for money, or the things that bring personal gain, and by which men have builded among the nations a tremendous commercial organization that at all times has been oppressive and injurious to the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a part of his commercial scheme, and as another means of defaming Jehovah’s name and of turning men away from the true God, Satan early in the history of man organized religion, and since then every religion practiced on earth has been used by Satan to defame the name of Jehovah God. “Religion,” as that word is properly used, means an outward form of worship which gives honor to men and to an unseen power. Many honest people believe that they are worshiping God, when in fact they are being misled by the Devil to defame God’s holy name. Some parts of the Bible are used by the clergy to support religions, and this affords another means of deceiving the people. All religions have indulged in the polities of this world, which is contrary to the Word of God. —James 1: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True Christianity means the faithful following by men in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, the Anointed of God. (1 Pet 2:21) That means entire devotion </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">Jehovah God, and not to any man or to any worldly organization directed by man. It means that the true Christians or followers of Christ Jesus must be witnesses to the majesty and supremacy of Jehovah God and bear testimony to the truth of God’s Word. (John 18: 37) In order to give testimony of the truth it is necessary for one to study and to understand the Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, which is the truth. -—John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Organized Christian religionists” have entirely overlooked the Scriptural meaning of the second coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom. The Bible testimony is all one way, to wit, that the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom is to vindicate Jehovah’s name by proving that Jehovah is the supreme and true God, that he is the God of wisdom, justice, love and power, and from whom all life and blessings flow. The Bible testimony further is that the kingdom of God under Christ is a righteous government, which kingdom or government will vindicate Jehovah’s name and is the only hope of the peoples of the world. In this year of 1933, when the nations and peoples all over the earth are in great distress and perplexity, ‘ ‘ organized Christian religionists” entirely ignore the Scriptural testimony as to the cause of this trouble, and how the world can be brought out of this depression, and in the place and stead of the Scriptures they follow the theories of men and join in all man-made schemes to relieve mankind. These religionists not only entirely ignore the cause of the trouble, but appear to be entirely blind to the divine remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy and the politicians pose before the people as followers of Christ and by word of mouth say, “We implicitly believe in divine guidance, ” and at the same time entirely ignore the Word of the divine God, who is Jehovah the Most High. No one who is truly devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom can have any part in the political affairs of this world. If these men, as they say, did implicitly believe and trust in the divine God, then they would follow his Word and would see that the great climax of trouble and wickedness is now upon the earth because of Satan, and that soon God will destroy this wicked organization, and in its place there shall follow a rule of complete righteousness; and they would teach the people these truths, and inform them that the kingdom of God alone will bring relief and blessings. Any persons who would join forces with socialists or communists or any other political organization in this day would thereby furnish the conclusive proof that they are not the servants of Jehovah God.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At all times opposition to the truth has originated with and proceeded from the Devil, and “religionists” have been the chief instruments of the Devil used to carry forward this opposition on earth. At the very beginning of the ministry of Christ Jesus the Devil tried to cause the destruction of Jesus. (Matt. 4:1-11) Jesus was constantly persecuted by the religious leaders, the clergy of his time, and the proof in the divine Word is that such religionists, the clergymen, were the agents of the Devil. Those religionists claimed to be the representatives of God, but to them Jesus said: “But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:40-44) Why has opposition to the Lord Jesus and his kingdom always been manifest? Because the Devil had sworn to turn all men away from Jehovah God and he has taken every opportunity to oppose God and his servants. When Jesus came to earth as the special witness of Jehovah and to redeem the human race, and to begin the work of taking out from the nations a people to be witnesses to Jehovah, the Devil wickedly opposed every part of his work. In this opposition the Devil used his earthly agents, to wit, the religionists of that time, and he has continued to use such men ever since. Jesus plainly told his true followers that they would receive like persecution from the same source of religionists.—Matt. 10:24,25; John 15: 18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is therefore certainly to be expected that the witnesses of Jehovah, that is to say, the true followers of Christ Jesus who would be looking for the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom and testifying thereto, would be the objects of the Devil’s wrath and of his cruel opposition. Jesus told his faithful followers that they would be hated of all nations at that time for his name’s sake, and the facts that have come to pass in recent years completely prove the fulfilment of this prophecy. (Matt. 24:9) To his faithful followers Christ Jesus committed the work of giving testimony to the truth, and told them that they would be wickedly persecuted by the Devil and his earthly representatives; and it is even so to this day.—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SEDITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The false charge of sedition and blasphemy was made against Jesus by the religionists, and he was wrongfully and without any true evidence convicted of that crime and put to death. The clergy who were his persecutors were the very ones who tried to destroy the evidence of his resurrection, and in that it is manifest that they were the instruments of the Devil. (Matt. 27: 62-66) It is certain, therefore, that the second coming of Christ and his kingdom would be violently opposed by the Devil and his agents, even as we see it going on at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Organized Christian religion” had its origin in the day of Constantine, the emperor of Rome. Then it was that the Roman Catholic hierarchy came into existence. From that time to the present day the Roman Catholic hierarchy has been the most powerful religious organization on earth and also the chief instrument of the Devil in opposition to the kingdom of God under Christ. It not only practices religion, but is a powerful commercial organization and a cruel political organization. Its opposition to truth has been and is subtle and deceptive, and thereby many honest persons have been deceived. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has always appeared before the people as a representative of God and of Christ, and yet at the same time has been the chief instrument for the persecution of all who have told the truth concerning God’s Word. It has tried to keep the people in complete ignorance of the Bible and has induced them to follow, instead of the Scriptures, the teachings of the Papal “religious organization”. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has at all times indulged m politics and tried to control the nations of the world. It has collected fabulous sums of money from the people to carry on its works. All true witnesses for the Lord have been classed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy as bigots, blasphemers and enemies of the state, and the charge of sedition and blasphemy is often laid against the humble followers of Christ Jesus. Such wicked opposition to the truth, and such persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, are made manifest today, particularly in the countries of Italy, Germany, Canada and the United States, and that persecution is led by the religionists of so-called “organized Christianity”, the chief instrument of Satan on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time when ministers of the Protestant religious organization opposed the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and called attention to its ungodliness, but in modern times the so-called “Protestant religionists” have abandoned the “protest theory” and joined forces with the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and both organizations are in opposition to God and his kingdom under Christ. These opposers of God’s kingdom under Christ, in an effort to hide their own crookedness, falsely charge the faithful followers of Christ Jesus with the crime of sedition and blasphemy. Such opposers constantly indulge in a campaign of circulating slanderous and libelous reports to the effect that Jehovah’s witnesses are violators of the commercial laws of the land and are allied with communists to overthrow the government. All reasonable persons can readily see that such opposition and persecution originate and proceed from the Devil and therefore “organized religionists and religions” are instruments and servants of the Devil and do not serve God and his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These statements are here made, not to provoke a controversy, but in order that honest persons who desire to know the truth may have a proper understanding of our Society and its work. The Society and its supporters are in no wise interested in the politics of the present world. Our work and devotion is entirely to Jehovah God’s kingdom under Christ, because such is the only hope of the human race, and because all blessings must proceed from God, and his witnesses delight to obey his commandments because such is right. Having devoted ourselves to Jehovah God, the divine commission and duty is laid upon us to bear testimony before the rulers and the peoples of earth of and concerning the great Jehovah and his kingdom. We have no fight with any person on earth, but in fulfilling our commission and duty of telling the truth as contained in the Word of God we draw upon us the fire of the visible agents of the Devil, and amidst such opposition and persecution we proceed with the work assigned to us. Knowing that this work is being done at the commandment of the Lord God we are certain that no opposition can destroy it, but that it will go on until Jehovah’s name is completely vindicated.—Isa. 54:17.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>TEACHINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has no formal creed, as that word is generally understood. It has no membership roll, but all who are truly devoted to God are asked to work together to the honor of Jehovah’s name. .It is not in any wise engaged in propaganda, because it does not seek to propagate any doctrine or bring others into its fold. As the followers of Christ Jesus we believe and teach what is in the Scriptures, and nothing more and nothing less. That being God’s doctrine, no human creature could propagate it; hence our work is not propaganda, but merely bearing testimony to the truth. The teachings of the Bible, the Word of God, and which is the truth and to which we fully subscribe, are, among other truths, as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great First Cause, the Creator of heaven and earth, is God, whose name alone is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah;</span><span class="font5"> and that name means his purposes concerning his creatures He has revealed himself to those who believe his Word under other names, to wit: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty God,</span><span class="font5"> meaning that his power is without limitation; the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Most High, </span><span class="font5">meaning that he is above all; the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lord of hosts,</span><span class="font5"> meaning that he is the great Warrior who will destroy the enemy; and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Eternal Father,</span><span class="font5"> because from him proceeds all life.—Ex. 6:3,4; Isa. 42:5, 8; Ps 91: 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The beginning of creation was his beloved Son, whose first title is the Logos. (John 1:1; Col. 1:15; Prov. 8:22-29) Thereafter all things created were created by Christ Jesus as the active agent of Jehovah. (Eph. 3:9) Among the creatures created was Lucifer, who was made the overlord of man and all other creation of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God created the earth as a place for man’s home, and the earth shall abide forever and be inhabited by those who love and serve Jehovah God.—Isa. 45:12, 18; Eccl. 1: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible is God’s Word of truth and is given as a guide and for the instruction of man in the way of righteousness, and it contains the expressed purpose of Jehovah; and those who study it may ascertain his purpose.—Isa. 46: 9-12; 55-11; John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God created man of the dust of the earth, breathed into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man thereby became a living, moving creature called a “soul”. (Gen. 2:7) The first man Adam was perfect, and it was his duty and obligation to obey God. (Deut. 32: 4) He was plainly informed by Jehovah that a willful violation of His law would mean death. Lucifer, the overlord ©f man, rebelled against God, and Adam, the first man, followed the lead of Lucifer in sin and was sentenced to death. (Ezek. 28:13-15; Gen. 3: 3-19) The power to produce children was exercised by Adam between the time of his sentence to death, which deprived him of the right to live, and the time of his actual dissolution; hence all of his children inherited the result of that death sentence and all the human race have been born as sinners. (Rom. 5:12) Jehovah God changed Lucifer’s name to that of Serpent, meaning deceiver; Satan, meaning opposer; Dragon, meaning destroyer; and Devil, meaning the slanderer of God. Ever since Satan has been the opponent of Jehovah God and the persecutor of all who serve God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures further teach that Satan the Devil challenged Jehovah God to put on earth any man that would be faithful and true to God at all times, Satan claiming that all men, under certain conditions, would curse God to his face. (Job 2:1-9) From that time until the present the human race has suffered woe, sickness, sorrow and death. In order that all creation might be able to intelligently determine who is supreme, and from whom the blessings of life and happiness proceed, and who is the just, wise and loving one, Jehovah or Satan, the great Jehovah God permitted or suffered Satan to put forth his endeavors to prove his wicked challenge, declaring His purpose in due time to bring the knowledge of the truth to all creation and to fully vindicate his own name. (Ex. 9: 16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> From the very beginning of man’s experience Satan has carried forward an organized opposition to God and to righteousness, and continues so to do, and will continue so to do until he and his organization are destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the history of man Jehovah God made promise and stated this promise to Abraham that he would raise up a seed which would redeem the human race from death and through which seed all the families and nations of the earth should have opportunity for blessings. That promised seed is Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah God.—Gen. 12:1-3; 22:18; Gal. 3:16-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In due time Jehovah God sent his beloved Son, the Logos, to earth, who was made a man or human, instead of a spirit, that he might be the redeemer of mankind and the vindicator of Jehovah God’s name.—Heb. 2: 9; 5:7-9; John 3:16; Phil. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When on earth Jesus was a perfect man, holy, sinless, and therefore competent to be man’s redeemer. (Matt. 1:18-25; Gal. 4: 4; Luke 1: 35) He began his ministry at the age of thirty years, and testified boldly to the truth, and for this reason was the object of constant and wicked persecution by the religionists of his time, and which religionists caused him to be crucified upon the tree. His lifeblood, poured out in death, provided the redemptive price for the human race. —Matt. 4:1-9; John 8:40-44; 1 Tim. 2:5,6, Heb. 9:22-26; 1 Pet. 1:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God raised up Jesus out of death and exalted him to heaven and gave him a name above every name and committed into his hands all power in heaven and in earth and made him the Executive Officer of Jehovah to carrv out his purposes —Eph. 1: 2022; Heb. 1: 3, 4; Matt. 28:18, Heb. 2.7, 8; 1 Pet. 3: 21,22; Ps 2:6, John 5: 21-27, Isa. 9:6,7; Ps.45:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When on earth Jesus emphasized the fact that he came to be a witness to Jehovah’s Word of truth and that he spoke only what God had commanded him to speak. (John 18 37) Just before his crucifixion he especially impressed upon the minds of his disciples that he must die and go away to heaven to receive the authority for his kingdom, and that in God ’a due time he would come again and receive his faithful ones to himself and set up his kingdom, and which kingdom would be a vindication of Jehovah’s name, and through which government the families and nations of the earth shall receive a blessing. He also emphasized the fact that he had suffered at the hands of Satan and his representatives, and that all of his true followers would likewise suffer; that he had borne testimony to the truth himself, and his followers must bear testimony to the truth, and for this reason Satan and his followers would persecute them.—Matt. 10:23-28; John 14:1-4; 8: 40-44; 15:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The disciples inquired of Jesus what would be the evidence <sup>l</sup>of his return, knowing that they would be unable to see him with natural eyes. To this question he replied that the evidence of his return, and the beginning of the exercise of his power, would be marked by a world war, in which nation would rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and that this would be followed by famines and pestilence in the earth, and great distress of nations with perplexity amongst the people. (Matt. 24:1-12; Luke 21: 2125) The facts that have come to pass show that 1914 marked the time when the Lord Jesus took his power and was sent forth by Jehovah to rule. That marked the end of the waiting period and the beginning of the exercise of his regal authority.—Ps. 110:1, 2; 2:6; Rev. 11:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures further show that the true followers of Christ Jesus do constitute a people taken out of the world for the name of Jehovah and that these must become Jehovah’s witnesses and bear testimony to his purposes.—Acts 15: 6-17; Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures and the facts further show that in 1918 the Lord Jesus began to gather unto himself his faithful followers to examine them and make them the representatives of the Lord on earth (2 Thess. 2:1), and to these he committed his testimony and sent them forth to proclaim this gospel of the Kingdom. (Rev. 12-17; Matt. 24:14) These being taken out from amongst the nations as the witnesses to the name of Jehovah, God himself gives to them the name “Jehovah’s witnesses”, puts the Word of truth in their mouths, and sends them forth to testify. For this reason the faithful followers of Christ on earth are now designated “Jehovah’s witnesses”.—Isa. 62:1, 2; 43:9-12; 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures also show that from and after 1918 all the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth must bear testimony to the truth as a witness to the rulers and to the peoples of the nations of earth; and that when this witness work is completed and the people have received notice, then there will come upon the world tribulation such as never before was known. That tribulation will be the battle of Armageddon, or the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which will completely wreck Satan’s organization and clear the way for the complete setting up of God’s kingdom of righteousness on earth amongst men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Satan has always opposed Jehovah and those who serve him, so Satan and his agents, and particularly the religionists, the Scriptures teach, would oppose Jehovah’s witnesses and persecute them and hale them into court, and kill some of them; and the Lord admonishes his faithful followers that in the face of all such opposition they must continue to proclaim the message of truth concerning his kingdom, and this they must do without fear of man. (Matt. 10: 24-32, Mark 13:9, 10) In fulfilment of these prophetic commandments of-the Lord, Jehovah’s witnesses are now engaged and must be engaged in testifying to God’s truth concerning the Kingdom, and for this reason Satan and his agents carry on a wicked and malicious persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in all the countries of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures also teach that these who continue faithful must do so without regard to persecution and are not to count this life dear unto them, nor to fear man, but to fear only God.—Matt. 10: 26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, the Scriptures foretold that the religionists would tell the people that the trouble upon the nations and peoples of the earth today is due to their lack of faithfulness to the religious organizations, and for that reason God is sending this trouble upon them; and also that such statement by the religionists is wholly false and a defamation of God’s name. Manifestly Satan is inducing this slander of Jehovah’s name in order to turn the people away from God. The present suffering and depression upon the world are shown by the Scriptures to be the result of Satan’s wickedness, as is stated: “Woe to the inhabit -ers of the earth and of the sea<sup>1</sup> for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he know-eth that he hath but a short time. ’ ’—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the complete destruction of Satan’s organization the people will be fully relieved of oppression. The righteous reign of Christ Jesus shall then open the way to all to love and serve God and find life everlasting in happiness, and those who do obey the Lord will live upon the earth forever, and not die. (John 17:3; 8:51; 11:25,26) “The Lord preserv-eth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.”—Ps. 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are the cardinal points set forth in the Scriptures; and those who are devoted to God and his kingdom are now making these truths known in obedience to God’s commandment, and hence could not be in any wise in a propaganda work. (Matt. 10: 27-33) The faithful followers of Christ Jesus look forward with great joy to the early destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of the righteous government under Christ, the lifting of the burdens from the backs of the people, and the outpouring upon the obedient ones the abundant blessings that Jehovah long ago promised to those who love and serve him. The work of the Society, therefore, is a voluntary work of doing good to mankind by pointing out to them God’s gracious provision for creatures It is a righteous and unselfish work, because it is not done for the purpose of individual gain, but to honor the great Jehovah God. It is a work of righteousness, because it is done at the commandment of Jehovah God and in honor of his name. We therefore confidently point all persons of good will to the facts in the light of the Scriptures and ask them to give careful consideration to what is herein set forth concerning the work that is being carried on in the earth by the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ANNUAL REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH has blessed the united efforts of his witnesses on the earth during the past year, and it is a real joy to report the progress of that work. Having in mind that this witness work is carried forward in North America and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the isles of the sea, and that the printed message is distributed in fifty-eight different languages, you will appreciate the fact that in this report it is practically impossible to give the minute details of the work. We must be content to make mention of some of the more important facts. Even though the number of the witnesses in the field is small, and the opposition is much greater now than in times past, yet the results show that the work of bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom has gone steadily forward This fact will serve as a comfort to each one who is privileged to have a part in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses today and every day delights to sing forth the praises of the Most High. It could not be otherwise with them. For many centuries the lovers of righteousness have waited for the coming of Jehovah’s King and his kingdom, and now Christ is here and his reign has begun. Soon wickedness shall be eliminated from the earth, Jehovah’s name vindicated, and the people brought to a realization of the fact that lasting peace has come to earth, and everlasting blessings to all who have good will toward God and righteousness. The fulfilment of the prophetic utterance at the time of the birth of Jesus is now being realized. (Luke 2: 9-14) Jehovah’s witnesses are privileged not only to discern these truths, but to announce them to others and thus to declare amongst the people the gracious works of the Almighty God With gladness they have received the truth, and with joy and boldness they tell the truth to others.—Isa. 12: 2-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First we delight to give thanks to Jehovah for the abundance of food provided for his own at the temple. He gave his word that all who are born of his organization shall be taught or fed by him and shall have great peace, and we have now abundant evidence that this precious promise is being fulfilled. Christ Jesus, the Head of Jehovah’s capital organization, has gathered unto himself at the temple those whom he has found faithful. Jehovah and Christ are the teachers, and Christ imparts to those of the temple company the present-day truths, and thus he teaches or feeds them upon food convenient for their upbuilding and consolation. All of the temple class fully appreciate the fact that no man is teaching them and that they need no man to teach them. Their strength comes from the Lord, because he is the great Shepherd of the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other precious things which the Lord has taught his people during the year is the truth that the church have ‘come into the unity of faith and knowledge’ and ‘henceforth are no more carried away by every wind of doctrine and the craftiness of men’. (Eph. 4:11-14) The cleansing of the temple is an accomplished fact. Those of the temple class are at unity, and henceforth ‘ ‘ in his temple doth every one speak of his glory ’ ’.—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year among some of the companies there have been disturbances made by fault-finders and murmurers, but it is quite manifest that such faultfinders and trouble-makers are not of the temple. They may be walking along in the company of some of the temple members, but in faet they are outside of God’s organization and cannot see what is on the inside. Only those of the temple class appreciate the truth and rejoice in their privileges just now. The temple class will proceed together in unity. They will not, and are not disposed to, waste any time in discussing foolish and unnecessary things, nor do they make an effort to justify themselves before men, knowing that such a course is displeasing to the Lord. (Luke 16:15) They know that Christ Jesus is their Judge and, if they are faithful in the performance of their divinely given commission, they will please him and please the Eternal Father, and that is all-sufficient. For this reason the faithful push forward in the work which has been assigned to them. They have and do manifest patience, which means that, knowing they are right and doing the Lord’s work according to his commandment, and have the approval of the Lord, even though suffering great inconvenience, persecution and contradiction of sinners, they steadfastly move on and boldly declare God’s truth as they go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the great Teacher has made known to his own the meaning of other prophecies not heretofore understood, and these truths have served as a great comfort and stimulus to the faithful, and thus the Lord has sustained them in making a hard battle. As you read here concerning some of the experiences of your brethren in other parts of the earth you will rejoice that you are privileged to be a part of the organization of the Lord that suffers at the hands of the wicked and yet amidst all such cruel opposition does not break its ranks but marches onward singing the praises of the Most High. Every one of the temple loves every other member of that blessed temple class, and all must be and are at complete unity. It is a little company united in the holy cause of Jehovah’s kingdom and in obedience to his commandments which continues to lift high the standard of the King that others may have the opportunity to know the true God and to set their hopes upon his King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the message of truth has been ‘proclaimed from the housetops’ by means of radio, by other means of speech, and by the wide distribution of books, booklets and magazines. The factory in Brooklyn has run on full time. Likewise the factory </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> Switzerland has operated full time. The Society’s factory at Magdeburg, Germany, during the first part ef the year operated three shifts of eight hours each per day, but about the middle of the year the enemy succeeded in closing it down. The production during the year, however, will be of great comfort and satisfaction to those who have had some part in the work. The distribution of the books and booklets amongst the people in all languages during the year has reached the aggregate of 24,074,401 volumes. Had not the enemy hindered the work in Germany the distribution would have been greater. We are not disturbed, however. The Lord is at the helm and he has good reason in permitting everything, and with this we are entirely content.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Since the main executive office of the Society is situated at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, and the principal manufacturing plant at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York, in the United States of America, the report from here is first set out, followed by reports of other parts of the earth. The main office at Brooklyn, and every branch office of the Society on earth, makes a report every thirty days of the progress of the work, including the cost of operation, and the general outlook in the field. These reports are sent to the president’s office, where they are carefully examined and checked and thus furnish the information which is the basis for the general direction of the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Enemies of Jehovah’s work in the earth give themselves much concern about how the money is obtained to carry forward the work of this Society. Religionists are always begging for money, and, seeing that our Society never solicits money, our opponents are perplexed and are compelled to trump up some kind of false charge as to the source of our income. Among the false charges made is the one that this Society is engaged in a book-selling scheme for profit. The facts are these: A small amount of money is taken for the publications of the Society, but on the whole this amount is less than the cost of production and publication. During the year the receipts for all the publications of the Society aggregate the sum of $455,080.62, while the costs of production and publication aggregate $662,187.64, leaving a deficit of $207,107.02. Of this amount branch offices returned to the Home Office the sum of $102,000.00, leaving a deficit still to the amount of $105,107.02. This deficit is made up by voluntary contributions of men and women who love God and who desire to have some part in the bringing to them the comforting message of truth concerning God’s kingdom, which is the only hope of the world. Millions of money are spent in worldly schemes upon a pretext of finding relief, but there is no human power that can relieve the peoples now. In the name of God’s King the people must hope. The Society contracts no debts, but expends money when it is in sight or in hand. The brethren make their contributions as the Lord prospers them, and thus the Lord carries forward his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The books and publications that are written and copyrighted by the president of the Society are in fact the property of the Society, and no part thereof belongs to the president or the writer. The copyright for each publication is immediately assigned to the Society, and that without royalty or other pecuniary consideration. Those who labor at the offices and factory, and in the gardens which produce food for the family, receive their necessary food and housing space and the small allowance of fifteen dollars per month for clothing and other incidental expenses. No one of the organization receives any pecuniary profit. All they have is wholly devoted to the Lord. As everybody is aware, the economic conditions throughout the earth are very bad; but in the face of all such the Lord has graciously provided the necessary means to carry on his work. Almost all of the contributions are in small amounts, because those who are rich in this world’s goods do not love the Lord. It is manifest that the Lord God through Christ Jesus is putting it into the hearts of the people who love righteousness to supply the necessary money, and that without any solicitation whatever; and to the Lord God thanks are due.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">By the term &quot;factory”, as used herein, is meant the printing and bookbinding machinery and establishment at 117 Adams St, Brooklyn, where the literature is published in twenty-two different languages and shipped out for distribution. I can do no better than to quote from the office manager’s report, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Jehovah has favored those who have the privilege of working at Bethel, whether it be at the factory or at the office or anywhere. In the building at 117 Adams Street there were an average of 138 working, to compare with 140 of the previous year. Even with fewer brethren, more work was accomplished. This can be accredited to unity, the Lord’s spirit and love for the work. Each one in the factory is able to operate two or more machines, so that when it is necessary to run second shifts the brethren can be transferred from one department to another and do that which is most important to be done at the time. Sometimes those in the office are put in the factory to help out during rush periods. All of the brethren are willing to do work other than their regular work, which keeps them busy all the year around, and give a helping hand when extra effort must be put forth to produce large quantities of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During the year the factory was operating 269 working days of 8i/<sub>2</sub> hours each. In addition to this time it was necessary to put on an extra night shift, which generally began at 5: 30 in the evening and ran till 2: 30 in the morning, for 22 days during the year. Also on 24 other days it was necessary to operate some machines extra time, from 7:00 in the evening until 9: 30. Most of this extra work was required a month or two prior to the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, in the spring, at which time the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font5"> booklet was being produced, and also during the month of August, when we were getting out </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> and making such large shipments of literature prior to closing down the factory for two weeks.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“During the 269 working days in the factory it has been the privilege of the brethren to produce more literature than any time in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Qy<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font5"> years that the factory has been in operation. In February, 1927, this factory began to produce, and in the first year there were manufactured 6,500,000 books and booklets and approximately 3,400,000 copies of magazines. Since then the factory has steadily increased, and this year the factory has produced 21^314,159 books and booklets. During the same period there were 4,691,750 copies of magazines produced, making a grand total of books, booklets and magazines for the fiscal year 1933, 26,005,909, to compare with last year’s production of 18,655,847.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A good many machines have been added to the factory in this period of time, and the brethren have become very efficient in the operation of these machines and, with the Lord’s spirit and blessing upon them, have been able to bring about such a large increase in the manufacture of the Kingdom message. These books are not being made and put in storage, but are being made because the demand in the field requires this number, as can be seen from the distribution report of the literature from the factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During the 269 working days the average daily production in the factory of clothbound books was 11,057, to compare with last year’s 10,453 bound books daily. The average daily production of booklets for the past year was 68,177, to compare with the previous year’s average of 42,506 booklets daily. Not only did the factory produce more books, booklets and magazines during the past year, but the increase in what we call odd jobs was very large. During the past year there were 16,000 calendars made, 75,000 catalogs, 2,204,506 office forms, bulletins, workers’ slips, 1,970,500 Jehovah’s witnesses’ calling cards, as well as 31,373,800 radio folders. This makes a grand total of odd-job printing of 35,639,806, to compare with last year’s total of this kind of work, 22,832,795. The increase of 1933 over the year 1932 in this nature of work is 12,807,011. In regard to the radio folders, 17,000,000 were used to advertise the regular transcription programs throughout the United States. The other 14,300,000 were used to advertise radio chain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">broadcasts and were given to the brethren free for distribution. The total number of individual pieces of matter printed during the twelve months of 1933 is more than 61,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During the year the brethren had the blessed privilege of working on two new books and two new booklets. In the early part of the year the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font5"> book was completed, and is having a very splendid circulation. During the last few days of the year the autographed edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> was completed, and was ready for the brethren before October 1. This book undoubtedly will find an unprecedented distribution during the year 1934. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font5"> booklet had the greatest production of any publication in the factory during the year. It was ready for distribution in the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period. Up to the present time the booklet has been produced in the Brooklyn factory in twenty different languages, and it has reached a grand total of 5,208,047 in the English and foreign languages. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom </span><span class="font5">came later in the year, and this takes second place as to production. Near the close of the year a special </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> was prepared by Brother Rutherford, and 1,100,000 copies of his lecture “Religious Intolerance: Why” and his open letter to the Catholic press were printed and shipped out to all the workers in the United States for free distribution along with other booklets. This campaign was very successful and brought about a tremendous witness, as is shown in the report of field activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During the fiscal year 1933 there were 149 different publications in the form of books and booklers printed. In addition to the books and booklets were the regular issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Ver dad,</span><span class="font5"> or Spanish publication, also the regular issue of the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and its translation in nine other languages.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>MATERIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“In order to produce this literature it required the purchasing of 2,191 tons of paper, and 169 tons of chip board which is used in the covers of the clothbound books. This means that during the year we have received in the factory in paper and cardboard alone 118 carloads. This is better than two carloads a week. That means that on the average there are 8 tons of paper that go through the presses each day in the printing of the Kingdom message. Additionally, the purchase was made of 246,418 yards of cloth, 2,047 rolls of gold tape and 74 barrels of paste. These three items were used in the preparing of the covers. Then there were 45,400 yards of crash, 662 spools of thread and 14,844 pounds of glue used in the manufacture of clothbound books. This glue that was used we manufactured ourselves in our own glue department. The glue we make is much stronger and better than that we have purchased heretofore, and it goes farther. We made more bound books this year than last year and used about 700 pounds less glue, and this glue was made at a much cheaper cost to us than if we had bought it on the open market. In a year’s tune we save approximately $600 on glue alone. Every effort is made by the Society to save in every department possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Society manufactures its own ink and paint, and during the year this department produced 36,669 pounds of ink. This is equal to one carload. We made a saving of several thousand dollars during the year in the manufacture of ink alone. We have also made 515 gallons of paint, which was used in the factory and office and Bethel home.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>SHIPMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“During the fiscal year 1933 there was more literature shipped out from the Brooklyn factory than at any time before. From Brooklyn the two depots in the United States are supplied with books and booklets in carload lots, and from these points the literature is reshipped. This saves money for the Society in shipping charges, as well as making it possible to supply rush orders with greater efficiency. During the year from these three points, Brooklyn, St. Louis and Oakland, orders were filled and shipped to the amount of 2,318,621 bound books, 17,280,116 booklets and 13,780 Bibles. In addition to these publications there were mailed and shipped over 4,600,000 magazinesand more than 31,000,000 radio folders. When our trucks go to the piers or freight stations with literature the men there are astounded at how well our business keeps going. Little they know that this is the Lord’s business and, even though the depression has hit all other business, it does not affect the Lord’s work, because the time has come to preach the Kingdom. It has given our truck drivers splendid opportunities at different times to witness to these persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At the present time we are bringing in from the piers and freight yards at least two earloads of raw materials each week, and at the same time we are dispatching each week literature that amounts to two carloads. The total number of books, booklets and Bibles shipped out during the year is 19,612,517, to compare with last year’s grand total of 13,750,707. This is an increase of nearly six million books and booklets over that of the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The booklets have had an unprecedented shipment. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font5"> booklet takes the lead: 4,360,665 were shipped out in the English language, and 320,622 in foreign languages. This brings the total </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font5">booklets shipped from the Brooklyn factory to 4,681,287. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> booklet, which came out late in the year and is being used in the first testimony period of the coming year, the Kingdom Proclamation Period, has been shipped out to the extent of 3,141,383. All of the other booklets, which are more or less new, such as the new series that came out last year, have had a very fine distribution. We have shipped out over one-half million of practically every one of them. A special campaign was put on during the month of September in connection with giving a very direct witness to the Catholics through a special </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> as well as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory, Crimes and Calamities</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">War or Peace</span><span class="font5"> booklets. These booklets were practically all shipped to the field in this month. It is an interesting comparison to see how the literature is sent from the Brooklyn office to the different divisions in the field, namely, the branches, companies, pioneers, auxiliaries, and to the public direct. The following is a table setting out this distribution ;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">number thereof is small. They are well organized, however, and work together harmoniously. They are made up of pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company workers. In each company organized there are a service committee, a service director, assistant service director, captains of divisions, and others assigned to special duties. The Society maintains in the field certain regional service directors, who speak different languages, and the duty of each is to visit the ' various companies and assist in the organization and the carrying forward of the work. During the fiscal year these regional service directors in visiting the various companies have traveled the aggregate of 209,415 miles, they visited 1,838 companies, and served at many divisional campaign assemblies. The combined efforts in the United States of the faithful field workers during the fiscal year 1933 resulted in placing in the hands of the people books and booklets to the total number of 9,872,335. Millions of persons have received the Kingdom message and are growing in knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It may be well said that of all those engaged in the field service the pioneers encounter the greatest amount of hardship, but the Lord makes up to them in increased blessings and joy of service. It would afford much pleasure to here make mention of the many experiences of the pioneers that have been reported to this office, but space will not permit this to be done. Suffice it to say, however, that those in the field as pioneers, although suffering much by reason of imperfect organism, severity of weather, arrests, imprisonment and, greatest of all, the contradiction of sinners and the defamation of Jehovah’s name, these with gladness and with boldness in the Lord, as He has commanded, push forward with their work. In his secret place Jehovah has revealed to them his precious truths, and in obedience to his commandments they go out and ‘shout these truths from the housetops’, which causes great confusion to Satan’s hordes. Often false charges are laid against them, such as ‘breaking the law relating to peddlers and hawkers’, and sometimes they are arrested, beaten and imprisoned, and yet none of these things deter them in their joyful service. They love the Lord God and his kingdom, and this is much dearer to them than the pleasures and comforts of this life. In due time the Lord will see to it that they are fully and completely recompensed. He always keeps his promises. The same may be said also of all the faithful workers in every branch of the service of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the United States the service work of all languages is combined under one service department. The English and foreign-speaking, and the colored servants of Jehovah, work together in complete unity, engaging in the common cause of righteousness. The year 1933 shows a record of these faithful workers to the praise of Jehovah. From the report of the Service Department the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Enrollment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have been more active pioneers this year than ever before, with a monthly average of 1,976, and the auxiliaries maintained the high monthly average of 939 active. The peak enrollment was reached on September 17, with a total of 3,031 pioneers and auxiliaries on the list, and while the number of auxiliaries did not materially change, more have entered the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Witness Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results by these workers during the past year show a consistent increase throughout. These have given a total of 10,554,440 testimonies, which exceeds the large number of testimonies during the preceding year by 1,572,601. The pioneers report 8,329,955 of these testimonies, and the auxiliaries, 2,224,485.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over 350,000 more people obtained literature than during 1932, the total number being 2,844,743, the pioneers placing literature with 2,335,988, and the auxiliaries with 508,755 persons. Of the 2,710,295 hours reported, the pioneers have spent 2,224,955 hours in the field, and the auxiliaries 485,340. This is an increase over the previous year of more than 300,000 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the total number of books shows somewhat of a decrease, there have been 1,196,377 more booklets placed with the people by the pioneers and auxiliaries during the past year than the year previous; and taking into consideration the distribution of 251,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> during September, a grand total of 5,280,749 pieces of literature has been left in the hands of the people by the pioneers and auxiliaries, or 1,193,898 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The five special testimony periods during 1933 have been zealously entered into by the pioneers and auxiliaries, with a very great increase in the testimonies they have given. The grand total distributed in these periods was 116,188 books, 800,087 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers gave more testimonies and left literature with more people than during previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The isolated pioneers are carrying the message to every corner of the country, and during the past year these have worked in 2,540 of the 3,074 counties in the United States. During 1933, 408 counties had no work done in them, although the majority of these were witnessed to during the previous year. Much work has been done in the very scattered sections throughout the middle west and northwest in spite of the extremely depressed condition of the people there, and it is hoped that next summer and fall the work in this part of the country can be further advanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considerable work has been done in countries outside of the United States by pioneers and auxibanes enrolled at this office. Reports have been received from Alaska, the Bahamas, Canal Zone, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dutch Guiana, Egypt, the Falkland Islands, Guatemala, Hawaii, Panama, Peru, St. Kitts, B.W.I., and the Virgin Islands. From these fourteen countries 24 pioneers and 5 auxiliaries have reported and there have been placed with the people 19,034 books, 34,857 booklets, making a grand total of 53,891 pieces of literature; an increase of 13,000 over the year previous. In these outlying sections 115,151 testimonies have been given, literature being placed with 26,641 persons, during 23,329 hours’ work. In addition to these countries pioneers have been assigned to Bermuda, Bolivia and British Honduras and are going there as the year closes, although no reports have yet been received. A pioneer will shortly proceed to Porto Rico. And, completing his work in the Falkland Islands, the pioneer there will proceed to the Canary Islands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>BETHEL FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">By the term “Bethel family” is meant those engaged in the Lord’s service at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, and 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, and Watchtower, Staten Island. In addition to their regular duties these brethren take advantage of every opportunity to participate in the field testimony work by going from door to door. This they do Saturday afternoons and Sundays. When there are special testimony periods they engage in these. During the year the following special testimony periods were had: Kingdom Testimony Period, Praise Testimony Period, Servant’s Testimony Period, Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, and Ambassadors’ Devotional Period. For two days during each of these periods the factory and home were closed that the brethren might participate actively in the field. During the year 180 workers were engaged in the field, and they put in 9,304 hours, gave testimonies to the number of 71,416, and placed with the people books and booklets to the number of 36,070. This shows an average of 35 percent of those to whom testimonies were delivered received the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year brethren were sent out from the Bethel home to serve other companies at the special testimony periods. At these assemblies, to the number of 269 during the year, the Bethel brethren served and actively engaged in the field service with companies aside from the Bethel family.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>COMPANIES AND SHARPSHOOTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The various companies and sharpshooters operating together with regional service directors have done a splendid work during the year. There has been no separate campaign by those speaking different languages, but of all languages the brethren have joined together in these campaigns, and which campaigns have had much to do with fully cementing the remnant throughout the land in one splendid harmonious forward action. These campaigns during the year have been richly blessed by the Lord, as the results will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 78 divisions throughout the United States, in which over 12,600 workers participated. During the latter part of the year these organizations became quite efficient and were enabled to give a very good account of themselves. In different sections of the country where trouble was encountered from local officials or the enemy endeavored to have the radio stations taken off the air, we were enabled within a week to send from 10 to 200 automobiles of workers into any trouble center. This was successfully done in a number of cases, and a very thorough witness was given by the distribution of literature and radio folders announcing stations where the transcription broadcasts and chain broadcasts might be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were numerous arrests at different places throughout the year. However, the only ones of any serious consequence were those which took place in New Jersey. These arrests were in practically all cases followed up with divisional campaigns, and in most places the local officials received the names and permitted the witness to go on without any further opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regional service directors to the number of 19, aside from the brethren who serve from Bethel, have actively engaged in the field, organizing and directing the activities of companies in campaigns. In that time they have served 1,838 companies, in which there have engaged workers to the number of 31,252, and these regional directors have traveled the total of 209,415 miles. It is gratifying to note the unity that now exists amongst the Lord’s remnant. The companies are well organized and united, and engage joyfully in the service in which the Lord permits them to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The divisional campaigns that have gone forward during the year number, to wit, 10, and in these special campaigns there were 1,971 automobiles employed, carrying workers to the number of 8,632. They worked in the field 257,815 hours, delivered testimonies to 1,486,049 persons, placed literature with 454,718 persons, the number of pieces of literature placed aggregating 921,567. During these special divisional campaigns 136 of the workers were arrested, thrown into prison and tried, and otherwise illtreated. Many others were arrested but were released without trials. Other arrests and trials were had which were not reported in these divisional campaigns, but the account thereof is set forth in the report elsewhere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s due time having arrived when his witnesses have come to unity of faith and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, it was deemed proper that there should be a united action at certain periods by all the remnant throughout the earth. To this end an international campaign was arranged, and reports have been received from 61 different countries where the remnant actively engaged in the field service. From these reports we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Early in 1932 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> called attention to the fact that God’s typical people celebrated two periods of the year, one in the spring and one in the autumn season, and therefore it seemed appropriate for God’s covenant people now to specially observe during the year two periods of thanksgiving and praise. Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth were quick to realize the importance of going forth in united action during these special thanksgiving periods, and during the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, April 8-16 of this year, the brethren responded to the call to service as never before. The two high spots of the year have been the Kingdom Testimony Period, October 1-9, 1932, and the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, April 8-16, 1933. During these two campaigns the remnant went forth as one army in assault against the Devil’s organization, and the Lord greatly blessed their efforts. We give herewith a brief summary of the results accomplished for these two periods:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The results of the Kingdom Testimony Period •were gratifying. Early in 1933 the Society began preparation to make the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period the greatest united witness ever given. Every reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was informed about this special witness in a letter from the president of the Society, and each one who professed to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses was invited to participate in this world-wide action. A new booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font5"> was released for this period and the various printing plants of the Society rushed the translation of the booklet and its publication in as many languages as possible, and as a result 52 different countries had </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font5"> in some language to place with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A special testimony was given to all workers to use with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font5"> booklet, and during this period the Lord’s little army moved into action in more complete unity than ever before, the brethren in 78 different nations of the earth going forward at the same time with the same testimony and, the greater part of them, with the same booklet. A goal had been set of 3,000,000 testimonies and 1,000,000 pieces of literature, but these figures were exceeded beyond all expectation. When the final figures were compiled they showed a total of 6,682,439 testimonies given and 3,920,190 books and booklets placed during the nine days. That was almost six times as many pieces of literature placed as during the preceding period, October 1-9. In previous periods the total number of workers was around 38,000, but in this period the number went up to 58,804; an increase of almost 53 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No doubt many of these new workers are of the Jona-dab class, which is making itself more and more manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A great amount of opposition was encountered; but in the places where the enemy hit the hardest, that was where the greatest witness was given. It was surely a wonderful Thanksgiving Period, and the brethren throughout the earth give thanks and praise to Jehovah for the splendid results achieved.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the Adam’s Street factory, Brooklyn, the Society publishes the Kingdom message in many languages aside from the English. Instead of having separate departments of service, however, all this service is carried on under one division. God’s people have come to realize that there are no divisions amongst them by reason of language, color, or previous condition of servitude, but all are one in Christ, working together. The following table shows the languages other than English in which the message has been printed and sent out from this office, the amount distributed in the United States, and the amount shipped to foreign branches, together with the total amounts distributed in all foreign languages.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>PERSECUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses during the year has increased with severity. There have been in the United States alone 268 of the faithful servants of the Lord arrested and compelled to undergo a form of trial, often resulting in fines and imprisonment. These arrests have been made chiefly in the states of Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa, Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey, the last-named state taking the lead in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. The charges laid against Jehovah’s witnesses have been that of ‘hawking and peddling without a license’ and that of going from house to house with literature without first obtaining a permit from the police officials so to do. In every instance the arrests have been made because of the influence of the clergymen exercised on local officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, the charges against Jehovah’s witnesses of being hawkers and peddlers have been without foundation in fact, because none of them are hawkers and peddlers. Where convictions were had in the magistrate’s court and appeal was taken to the higher court the judgment was reversed. Some of our brethren, however, preferred to serve terms in jail rather than to appeal their case to the higher courts or to pay a fine. The law-making body of the land, by enacting laws and ordinances governing hawkers and peddlers, had no intention of applying such laws to those who engage in preaching the gospel by the distribution of the printed message. Furthermore; the fundamental law of the United States and of the states provides that everyone shall be permitted to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. The arrest of Jehovah’s witnesses for preaching the gospel, and charging them with being hawkers and peddlers, has been maliciously done by enemies of the truth, and the ‘hawker and peddler’ laws have simply been used as a subterfuge behind which the persecutors might hide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A hawker and peddler is one who goes about the streets or other public ways and by outcry offers his goods, wares and merchandise for sale for a pecuniary profit. The reason for the law is the life of it, and the reason for such law requiring a license is to protect the resident merchant who is required to pay a license, as well as to pay rent and taxes. The theory of the law is that where one competes with another for trade each one should be required to pay a license tax. Jehovah’s witnesses are not competing with anyone for trade. They are preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, because Jehovah has commanded that it shall be done at the present time. They are the only company of people on earth engaged in this kind of work, and therefore could not compete with anyone else. They are not doing this work for pecuniary profit, but at cost of money and physical effort to themselves. It costs money to buy the material for the printing and manufacturing of the books and to get them into the hands of the people. Jehovah’s witnesses would be glad to freely give everyone the literature, but because they are not rich in material things such a course would be practically impossible. Further, all people of good will desire to contribute something for what they receive and thus to make it reasonably possible to defray the expense of getting this message into the hands of others who cannot pay. Many of the books are given away to those who are too poor to contribute anything. All reasonable persons can readily see that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a work of doing good to the people, because God has commanded this gospel of the kingdom must now be preached as a witness to the people to enable them to know of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy are angry because the gospel is preached, and the reason for their anger is that the truth exposes the duplicity of the clergymen and enables the people of sincerity to see that they have been fleeced and deceived by these parasites for years past. The elergy are not at all interested in what the people hear and believe as long as they are permitted to carry on their deceptive work by which they obtain money from the people. Of course, there is occasionally a clergyman who is kindly disposed toward the truth, but he is not sufficiently enlightened, nor does he possess the zeal for the Lord to take his stand wholly on the Lord’s side. The opposing clergymen go about amongst their congregations and, finding anyone with books explaining the Bible, they urge them to burn the books, in order that the people may not learn the contents thereof. These same opposers openly advocate violence toward Jehovah’s witnesses and urge that they be driven out of the community. The clergy have no knowledge or understanding of the message of God’s kingdom, and they do not want anyone else to have. In their church buildings they denounce Jehovah’s witnesses and preach anything except the truth concerning Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why, then, do Catholic priests, Baptist and Methodist preachers, and the preachers of other denominations engage in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses? Why do they induce police officers and magistrates to inflict punishment upon these faithful followers of Christ Jesus? The answer is, because these persecutors and opposers are instruments of their father, the Devil, and his bidding they do, just as Jesus told the clergy of his time. (John 8:42-44) Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great Witness, and he has committed to his faithful followers his testimony now to be delivered amongst the peoples of the nations that the people may know the name of Jehovah and of Christ and the blessings his kingdom will bring. To his faithful followers Jesus said concerning these clergymen and their allies in persecution: “If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. . . . All these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him [Jehovah] that sent me.”—John 15:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, Jehovah is now forcing his opponents to plainly identify themselves as being on the side of Satan, and for this reason Jehovah’s witnesses must bear testimony to the truth; and this affords an excuse for the clergy to persecute them, and by so doing they identify themselves as the enemies of God and of his kingdom. They draw police officials and magistrates into their conspiracy with them and thus cause them to identify themselves. Concerning this very time Jesus said: “But take heed to yourselves; for they shall deliver you up to councils, and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. ’ ’—Mark 13: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By his prophet Jehovah makes it clearly to appear that the clergy and their allies in all “Christendom” have entered into a conspiracy to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee ” (Ps. 83: 2-5) The Lord has revealed to his own people that Gog, the chief officer of Satan the Devil, is leading in this conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses, his hidden ones, and that this conspiracy is not only formed in this day but overt acts are now being committed in furtherance of that wicked conspiracy. Jehovah’s faithful ones he has forewarned, that they may be prepared for the attack of the enemy. He has given his assurance that he will protect and deliver those who will continue faithful unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But why should Jehovah permit his servants to be wickedly persecuted when his King is here and his reign begun? It is written for his faithful ones: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22) Now Jehovah has revealed to his people more clearly than ever before just why this must be so. Satan challenged Jehovah to put men on earth who would maintain their integrity toward Jehovah, Satan declaring his ability to cause men to suffer so much that they would curse God to his face. (Job 2:4,5) This raised the issue of supremacy, which involved the word and name of Jehovah. It could be settled only by men being put to the test. The perfect man Jesus, even though a Son, must meet this test, prove his complete devotion to Jehovah, maintain his integrity toward Jehovah God, and thus prove Satan a liar; and this he did. For this reason Jehovah permitted his Son to suffer the contradiction of sinners and great persecution, and through all of these things Jesus proved himself faithful and thereby vindicated Jehovah’s name and proved his qualification to become the Savior of the human race and the great Vindicator of Jehovah. Hence it is written: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Heb. 5: 8, 9) It follows necessarily that every one who enters the kingdom of Christ Jesus must undergo similar contradiction and sufferings and must maintain his integrity toward God. (1 Pet. 2: 21) How else could it now be possible for anyone to be a real witness to the name of Jehovah unless he is opposed and persecuted by the enemies of God and of Christ? “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us. ’ ’ (2 Tim. 2:12) Such is a divine condition precedent to anyone’s becoming a part of the royal house; and particularly is that true at the present time. For this reason Jehovah’s witnesses are not at all discouraged or bowed down because of persecution. On the contrary, such to them is evidence that they are on the Lord’s side and have his approval. (Phil. 1:28) Clergymen and public officials command and will eon-tinue to command that Jehovah’s witnesses cease preaching the gospel of the kingdom, but Jehovah’s witnesses will obey no man, but will obey God, by His grace. They know that they are hated by all nations because they testify to the name of Jesus Christ and Jehovah, even as Jesus said it would be. He further said to them: “Fear them not”; that is, do not fear the enemy, but fear God. Christ Jesus has gathered his faithful remnant into the temple, and there in the secret place of the Most High he has taught and is teaching them, and he sends them forth to proclaim openly what they have learned there secretly. They must be bold witnesses, that is to say, declaring the message of truth openly and aboveboard. ‘What I tell you in darkness [in the secret place of the temple, which is darkness to all on the outside], preach ye from the housetops. ’ The servants of Satan have killed some of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, and may kill more of them; but the faithful will always have in mind the words of Jesus, to wit: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[gehenna].”</span><span class="font5"> (Matt. 10:22-33) Jehovah’s witnesses must obey either man or Jehovah God. They will not hesitate to determine whom they shall obey. It is therefore easy to be discerned that these faithful witnesses of Jehovah are not deterred in their work by reason of persecution at the hands of the enemy, nor will they in any wise refrain from doing what God has commanded them to do. By His grace they will continue to sing the praises to his name and joyfully declare his kingdom as the hope of all who love righteousness. This they have been doing throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses has been severe also in Canada; and always such persecution is done by and under the influence of the clergymen, and particularly the Catholic priests. Many of our brethren have been arrested in that part of the field. Public officials have done what they could to prevent the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom in that land, but the work has progressed even in the face of all such opposition. In Japan the clergy and their allies have caused the arrest of every one of Jehovah’s witnesses and have imprisoned a number of them. More detailed report of this will appear under the subtitle </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Japan.</span><span class="font5"> In Australia there has been much persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. The greatest amount of persecution during the year, no doubt, has taken place in Germany, and a more detailed account of which will appear at another place in this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are one united band under the leadership of Christ Jesus, their King. They are at full unity and are thoroughly hated by every branch of Satan’s organization, and are glad that is so. These faithful witnesses are now on Mount Zion, that is to say, Jehovah’s capital organization, and against them the enemy is assembled preparatory for the final assault. These faithful ones see the manifestation of God’s love toward them, and, knowing that their persecution and suffering come from the enemy, and because they are faithful to Jehovah and his King, they continue with ever-increasing joy to sing the new song. (Rev. 14:1-4) To these faithful witnesses the year has been a blessed one. They know that they are right and have the approval of the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As we know, the radio belongs to Jehovah; but the enemy has tried to completely control it during the year. To be sure, God could prevent him from intar-fering, but the Lord has made it clearly to appear that he permits the enemy to do his v. orst until Jehovah’s due time to completely destroy him and his organization at Armageddon. It has pleased the Lord, however, during the year to permit a wide witness to be given by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An invitation came to the president of the Society to use a number of radio stations in Europe. In the month of June broadcasts were made over five stations in France and from the largest station in Holland. These broadcasts were widely advertised by both our friends and our enemies. Even the pope sent word along to the Catholics that ‘they must not listen to that man Rutherford ’. Evidently this sharpened their desire to hear; and following the broadcast many letters came from Catholics, expressing their great appreciation of what they heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to these personal addresses by radio in France and Holland a number of stations in Europe have broadcast each week the Kingdom message by means of electrical transcription These speeches are made at Watchtower on Staten Island, where the wax is cut and then transmitted to the pressing factory where the final work is done in preparing the discs. These discs are then sent to the radio stations and used to broadcast the Kingdom message. During the year 408 radio stations, by means of electrical transcription, have broadcast the Kingdom message as prepared and used on the discs above mentioned. These countries are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Philippines)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the broadcasts of the speeches of the president of the Society by means of electrical transcription there were several chain broadcasts, in which a number of stations were linked together in the United States, during the year. April 16, 48 stations were included in a chain network. April 23, 55 radio stations were included in a chain network. April 30, 57 radio stations simultaneously broadcast. July 30, 3 radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year other chain broadcasts were had. Early in the fiscal year it was the privilege of the Society’s president to use 5 radio stations for broadcasting in Cuba. In the month of November, 1933, 7 radio stations were used for broadcasting the speeches of the president of the Society in Mexico city. These broadcasts brought many responses from people who heard the truth for the first time, and the number interested in these countries has increased since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special transcription broadcasts were put on radio stations of the United States, to the number of 169 stations on June 18, broadcasting the lecture “The Way of Escape”; June 25, 158 stations broadcasting the “Effect of Holy Year”; July 2, 160 stations broadcasting “Kingdom Blessings for the People”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These lectures thus broadcast greatly angered the Catholic hierarchy, particularly, and other clergymen. An organized movement was started immediately by them to coerce and browbeat and boycott radio stations to compel them to discontinue the broadcasting of any of the speeches concerning the Kingdom. They employed every Catholic newspaper in the United States for this purpose; they called into action the cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, knights, “Holy Name” societies, Ancient Order of Hibernians, and all other Catholics they could induce to act with them to bring influence to bear upon the various radio stations and upon the Radio Commission at Washington to prevent further broadcasting of the Kingdom message. Out of upward of 300 stations in the United States this combined effort of Satan’s agents, at the close of this fiscal year, had induced 28 radio stations to yield to their extreme pressure and coercion and to discontinue these broadcasts. Other stations, however, have made application for the transcription records and will take them on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the act of Congress created regulating radio in the United States the Radio Commission has no legal authority to censor programs or to interfere with personal broadcasts. Great pressure has been brought to bear upon the Radio Commission, however, to get them to act in coercing stations to refuse to carry these programs. Some stations have been frightened into yielding. There is one thing certain, however, that not one of these lectures has ever attacked anyone personally, and they only expose false doctrines which have misled the people; and at the same time informed the people of the truth concerning God’s Word and his kingdom, which truth is of the greatest public necessity, public interest and public convenience. These lectures, therefore, exactly meet every requirement of the Federal Radio Act, and there is no occasion for any station to be frightened that they have violated any part of the law in broadcasting these transcription records. The Catholic hierarchy has the idea that it can control the speech in America and can. prevent anything from being spoken that might offend the sensibilities of these “distinguished highbrows’’ who have attempted to keep the people in the darkness all these years. Manifestly the Lord will have his truth proclaimed just enough to compel every one of them to fully and completely identify himself as being on the side of Satan the enemy. But even if they should succeed by the Lord’s permission in driving every radio station from the air so far as the Kingdom message is concerned, the Lord has another and effective way of getting this message to the people, by means of electrical transcription, which is mentioned in another part of this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the broadcasts of the lectures of the president of the Society foregoing, many of the brethren have used WBBR and other radio stations in local broadcasts, a complete record of which is not at this time obtainable. In addition to this, however, there have been broadcasts by radio lectures in foreign languages during this fiscal year, as follows: Armenian, 12; French, 52; German, 107; Hungarian, 26; Italian, 137; Lithuanian, 5; Polish, 404; Russian, 96; Scandinavian, 58; Spanish, 14; Ukrainian, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The broadcasting of the message of the Kingdom by radio far exceeded that of any previous year. There was an average of 65 lectures broadcast for each and every day during the year. The total number of lectures broadcast thus was 23,783 during the year, to compare with 8,000 in previous years, by electrical transcription.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, Jehovah always foreknows the activities of the enemy, and this is particularly made manifest with reference to the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom by means of electrical transcription. During the year it was brought to the attention of the Society that portable machines could be made that will reproduce lectures by means of electrical transcription and with such amplification that they are sufficient to reach every part of the largest hall or to be heard by thousands of people in open places such as parks, and other public places. Manufacturers were engaged and the work began, and during the year in the United States 338 of these machines have been prepared, part of them driven by electric motors, and others by springs, which are wound. Many of the companies have provided themselves with one of these machines, and the transcription records or discs are furnished to them by the Society, and regularly they are put on at meetings in parks, fairgrounds, picnics, halls, or in homes, or wherever a number of people can be assembled who desire to hear the truth. The work has only gotten fairly started during the latter part of the fiscal year, and within a few short months there have been reported to this office meetings held at which these transcription records were used to the number of 4,646, with an attendance of 240,434 persons. Splendid results are being reported, many of the people taking the literature are drawn together for closer communion and study of the Word of the Lord. More of these transcription machines are m course of construction, and it is hoped that one or more will be placed with every company in the United States and that every company of pioneers will have one of these machines so that the people can be gathered together in smaller groups throughout the land and instructed concerning the Lord and his kingdom. Up to the present time there is no law enacted that could at all interfere with or prevent such meetings and such broadcasts, and thus it appears that the Catholic hierarchy, in their desperate attempt to prevent the people from hearing the message of truth by electrical transcription, will be disappointed. Probably they will see after a while that the Catholic hierarchy is not so important as it thinks, and it is quite certain that it is not the instrument of Jehovah God, but the instrument of the god of this world, used to darken the minds of the people. The time has come in which Jehovah will make known that he is God, and the power of the Catholic hierarchy and all other enemies combined together cannot at all prevent the message from being brought to the people. Hundreds of Catholics throughout the country, by letter and otherwise, are signifying their great appreciation of the truth and desire to further hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every community where the Catholic priests are strong the opposition is greater. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses at Plainfield, N. J., provided the occasion for a public address’ being made from a theater building on Sunday, July 30, which address was broadcast by several radio stations. The speaker on this occasion was literally surrounded by firearms in the hands of sixty or more policemen who had come to the meeting uninvited and who were not either needed or wanted, but doubtless had been sent there at the instance of the Catholic hierarchy, looking for an occasion to prevent the meeting and possibly to destroy the speaker. Thanks to the Lord God and his King, nothing of this kind was permitted. The speech delivered on that occasion has been put in electrical transcription form and will be furnished to all companies of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the whole earth, that they may have opportunity to inform other</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholics just how the hierarchy works to keep the people in darkness. Already 2,400 of these transcription records of this particular speech have been made. This will supply 600 machines with the full speech; and others are in progress of manufacture.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A number of the pioneers have availed themselves of an opportunity to have these machines, and now there are 128 machines in their hands, which are used by them each week. They get a vacant lot in a town or village, or place in a public park, or hall or house, free of charge, notify the people and, after a piece of music, give them one or more lectures and then further acquaint them with the message of the Kingdom by way of the printed literature. During the brief space that these machines have been in operation the pioneers have held 2,108 of such meetings, with a total attendance of 105,257; and thus the witness to the Kingdom goes grandly on regardless of all opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the year the clergy of Canada began a campaign against the use of the radio for broadcasting the Kingdom message in that land The Radio Commission was induced to yield, and did yield, issuing an order that no speech of Rutherford should be broadcast in Canada Immediately a paper was issued, entitled “AN IMPORTANT NOTICE”, which was published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine, and millions of copies were printed and distributed throughout Canada, as will appear from the Canadian report. A copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine carrying this notice was sent to every newspaper and magazine in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic hierarchy attempted to make 1933 a holy year by breaking a hole in a wall at the Vatican</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and going through certain incantations. Of course, the hierarchy succeeded in deceiving some people; but many are not deceived. The lecture, the “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity”, had a wide circulation, not only by radio, but by other means. It was published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine and sent to all its subscribers, of course, and to thousands of others. This magazine also carried the “Religious Intolerance” speech delivered at Plainfield, New Jersey. The Catholic press throughout the United States attacked the president of the Society for delivering the address “Effect of Holy Year”, and a letter was written, addressed to all the Catholic newspapers, and a copy sent to each one of them. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font5">magazine carried that letter also, together with the copy of the “Holy Year” speech. A million two hundred thousand copies were distributed throughout the United States and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine has had a healthy increase of subscribers during the year. It is finding many friends in every part of the country, and many unhesitatingly express themselves as finding in the magazine the truth plainly and fearlessly stated, which is doing great good to the people. The pioneers and company workers are finding it helpful to call the attention of the people where they go to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font5">magazine and take their subscriptions. This is a splendid way of getting the truth out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the magazine published in English at the Brooklyn factory it is also published and distributed in German, Greek, Polish and Spanish, and is sent to its many subscribers not only in America but in foreign countries, being mailed from the Brooklyn office. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine is not published for profit, it receives no advertisements, and the amount received for subscriptions scarcely pays the cost of production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCHTOWER</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine we designate as the official publication of the Society because through its columns it pleases Jehovah God to make known to his people an explanation of present-day truths. The leading article in each issue carries an explanation of some particular prophecy or other scripture now due to be understood. All credit and honor are due to the Lord for w’hat appears in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> It does not attempt to express a man’s opinion, but we look to the Lord for his guidance and for the feeding of his people through its columns. During the year some of the subscribers have become offended and fallen away, but even more have come forward and taken their places, so that the subscription list at the end of the year is greater than it was at the beginning. Many of the Jonadab class are learning that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> contains food for them, and they delight to receive it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is published not only in the English language, but at the Brooklyn factory it is published and mailed out in the following other languages, to wit: Armenian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian. The company workers, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters take subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and delight to thus enable others to have opportunity to feed upon the Lord’s food provided for them through its columns.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>MAIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The mail at the president’s office is quite heavy each day, and the busy ones in the field will appreciate the fact that it requires much time and effort to give personal attention to mail. Many of you have found responses to your letter quite brief because of the necessity for using the time to a better purpose. Many questions that are propounded are answered in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and the books and booklets, and a little effort in looking them up would save the writing of letters. It is a real pleasure to respond to all letters possible, but it has not been possible during the year to give close attention to all letters that come into the office. The mail is opened by the assistants in the president’s office and examined and marked, and is answered m its regular order as time permits. Of course, the mail from the foreign branches and the managers is of first importance, and requires the first attention. Let each one, however, feel absolutely free and at liberty to write when he desires, and this information is given only that you may understand, if you do not receive reply, that other pressing matters have prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The general mail and all mail orders, of course, go to the 117 Adams Street office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A force is kept busy at the office receiving and answering the mail. During the year letters and cards have been received in the aggregate of 301,012. This amount has been reduced by reason of the fact that the companies and pioneers make a monthly instead of a weekly report. During the year the Society shipped direct from the office in filling personal orders 131,817 pieces of literature, which is an increase of more than 30,000 over that of the previous year. The office dispatched during the year 295,762 letters and cards. The Society has printed and sent out during the year 75,000 catalogs in response to personal requests that have come through the mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The entire year has been filled with great joy for all of those engaged in the work at the Brooklyn headquarters. The Lord has graciously provided their material needs in the way of food, clothing and housing. The gardens have produced much health-giving food at a minimum cost. Because of the depressed conditions the allowance for incidental expenses has been decreased, even though the dollar purchasing value is less today than it was a few years ago The Bethel family appreciate the fact that the Lord has provided their needs, and they delight to make some sacrifice in regard to personal needs that there may be others assisted in having a part in the proclamation of the Kingdom message.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>FOREIGN COUNTRIES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">With Jehovah’s witnesses there is no such thing as a foreign country, because all of Jehovah’s witnesses are at unity and therefore at one and the entire field is the earth. So long, however, as present conditions exist we distinguish the various places according to the lines that are marked out by the rulers of this world. The United States of America being the place of the home office, we call the other places, aside from the United States, foreign. Each one of these countries has a branch office and a local manager who looks after the work within his jurisdiction, makes his report every thirty days to the main office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, and his general report at the end of the fiscal year. Herewith is submitted a brief summary of these reports received from various countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The countries of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales and the annexed islands are embraced in the territory herein designated “Great Britain”. Within that land there is an earnest and zealous company of Jehovah’s witnesses wholly devoted to God and to his kingdom and putting forth their best endeavors to deliver the testimony to the name and honor of the Most High. A brief personal visit with many of them during the year convinces me beyond a doubt that the remnant in Great Britain is in splendid spiritual condition and fighting trim. Surely there never has been a time in which there is such unity amongst God’s people as the present; and this is exactly as we should expect it to be. A convention was held at Liverpool, England, in June, which it was my privilege to attend. A goodly number of our brethren in England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales were present, and all were of one mind and one spirit. It was a joy to see their happy faces and observe their zeal for the Lord and his kingdom. On that occasion a discourse on “The Penny” was given, and the enthusiasm with which it was received bore testimony to the fact that the remnant present had ‘received their wages’ and were greatly rejoicing to continue in the service in the field which the Lord has provided for them. It is always a real joy to visit the brethren in Great Britain, but it seems that on this occasion there was special joy amongst all who were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The persecution of the remnant has not been so marked in Great Britain as in other places, and it appears that there are two reasons therefor: (1) The clergy in that country have the support of the state and are at ease and little concerned about what others are doing or saying, as long as they receive their daily requirements; and (2) that land being the “seat of the beast” and which practices “like a lamb” for the purpose of deception, and the chief officer of Satan being Gog, who organizes and carries forward the conspiracy, it is to be expected that there would be an attempt on his part to hide a proper understanding of the prophecies relating to the conspiracy. We must bear in mind that Canada and the United States form a part of the Anglo-American empire, and that even Germany is a part of “Christendom”. While Satan and his chief officer seeks to divert the attention of the people away from the fulfilment of Ezekiel’s prophecy, he does not succeed in this so far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned. God is not mocked, and his people are in no wise deceived by the enemy at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of the brethren from England have gone into France, Spain, Belgium, South Africa, India, Australia and other places and there engage in the service, because of the smallness of the field in their native land. These brethren from Great Britain have been greatly blessed and are rejoicing in the privileges that the Lord has given them in other parts of the earth. All over the earth Jehovah’s remnant people are one, united in Christ Jesus, marching forward, singing the praises of the Most High and giving testimony to his name and to his kingdom. These faithful ones are not concerned as to how long they must continue in the work on earth. Having devoted themselves entirely to Jehovah God, and having been made a part of his organization and employed in his service, it matters not to them whether the time on earth is long or short. With the faithful it is ‘for ever with the Lord’. They are satisfied to be in his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are in the service of Jehovah and his kingdom wherever they be. Happy is the lot of the remnant!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The management of the Society’s office at London, following the usual and customary course, has made a report to this office of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in that land; and from that report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year just drawn to a close has been one of uninterrupted service in the interests of the Kingdom. We know that the clergy and their allies are in opposition to the witness now being given to the honor of Jehovah’s name, still there has been no evidence in this country of combined opposition on the part of Big Business, big politics or big elergy. It has therefore been the happy privilege of all branches of the service in the British Isles to witness, principally by house-to-house visiting, and to spread the good news of the Kingdom. The monthly reports which it is our privilege to send you will have prepared you for the increase in the output of literature during the twelve months. Considering the financial condition of the people, which grows worse as time proceeds, and the fact that the territory of these islands is limited, we gladly acknowledge that it is only by the power of the Lord that the output of literature has reached the grand total of 2,669,885 pieces, consisting of 279,807 bound books and 2,390,078 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of service units is 368, of which an average of 342 have regularly engaged in the service work month by month and reported to this office. There are 5,403 company workers who hold the Society’s permit, and of these, 3,897, on an average, have engaged in the work monthly, representing 72 1 percent; this is an increase of 12.1 percent as compared with last year. The hours reported reach a total of 486,608, a decrease of 37,108; nevertheless, a total of 1,206,617 pieces of literature was placed, consisting of 117,632 bound books and 1,085,449 booklets, and including 3,536 Bibles. In placing this literature the brethren gave 4,793,892 testimonies, and 966,163 members of the public took literature from us, which represents an average of 1 book or booklet placed after giving 4.9 testimonies. The decrease of bound books compared with last year is due to the fact that more time than usual has been spent in distributing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet and clearing the older booklets to make way for the new booklets issued by the Society. Over three months of the twelve months were spent entirely on booklets. Another factor which cannot be overlooked is that the spending power of the public is considerably less than in 1932 and the number of volumes in the hands of the pubbc has increased considerably over the last few years. During the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> campaign a special invitation was sent to 1,700 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers, offering them the privilege of joining with us in distributing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet. The result was that over 600 who had never participated in the service work before joined up, and many have since continued regular active service. The enlarging of the service committee, announced in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> September 1, 1932, and followed without exception in this country, has undoubtedly increased the efficiency of the service and united the workers to an extent never before experienced. The service directors have also appreciated the arrangement made for them to report monthly instead of weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Service Directors</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For nine months of the year five brethren were regularly engaged in visiting the companies as regional service directors. In accordance with your instructions three of these brethren were transferred to other activities, and only two service directors are now serving as such, one in Scotland and the north of England, and the other in England and Wales. The gathering of the Lord’s people together in the fellowship of service and praise is always a time of joy; so arrangements are now made for three or four surrounding companies to gather with one company on the occasion of the visit of one of these regional service directors. The companies, without exception, have appreciated the arrangement, and the directors themselves have experienced increased joy in the service. These brethren have made 626 visits to the companies and held 7,922 service meetings. They have been the leaders in 2,063 service campaigns and have reported 3,437 hours in the field service. Their testimonies amount to 29,344, and they placed 11,070 books and booklets. In this service they traveled 26,294 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The limited territory of necessity limits the number who can engage as pioneers, and to some extent the number of auxiha-ries. We have more applications for the pioneer service than we can accommodate with territory; but the desire of these brethren is not entirely nullified, because several have found an opportunity in France, Belgium and other European countries. Of 212 pioneers and 130 auxiliaries enrolled, 203 and 116.6 have engaged in the work regularly on the average monthly. The pioneers have reported 241,466 hours, in which they have given 1,580,207 testimonies, placing a total of 511,675 pieces of literature, of winch number 157,656 w’ere bound books, and 354,019, booklets; in addition, they have placed 3,188 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliaries have reported 69,025 hours, have given 592, 645 testimonies and placed a total of 136,199 pieces of literature; of these, 27,615 are books and 108,584 are booklets, and, in addition, 1,138 Bibles 'There is a decrease in the number of bound books placed by both the pioneers and the auxiliaries, and also a decrease in the number of booklets, compared with last year. As in the case of the company workers, this is undoubtedly due to the fact that the spending power of the people is less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The members of the Bethel family, whose time spent in the field is of necessity limited by their duties and privileges in the office and home, have nevertheless been faithful in seeking at every opportunity to bear the fruits of the Kingdom. It is with joy and gratitude that we report an increase m hours spent in the field, an increase, as a direct result, in testimonies given, an increase m obtainers, and an increase in books, booklets and Bibles placed. Week by week throughout the year each member of the family has averaged 5 hours’ service in the field. They have given 37,892 testimonies, and placed 1,896 bound books, 12,098 booklets and 40 Bibles, a total of 14,034 pieces of literature, which is an increase of 4,213 over the preceding year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were 24 service assemblies arranged during the year. Of these the outstanding assembly was that at Liverpool. The fact that you were present with us there was undoubtedly an encouragement to the remnant and an incentive to continued zeal in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom work. The fact that the Liverpool corporation’s largest and finest hall was placed at the disposal of Jehovah’s witnesses, after the adversary had caused the hall engaged for the convention to be burned to the ground three days before the convention was due to assemble, not only was an evidence that he is actively engaged against yourself in particular and the remnant generally, but is a further evidence that the Lord is able to protect and provide for the needs of his people as and when we call upon him to do so “ For your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.” (Matt. 6:8) At these conventions 171,040 testimonies were delivered and 25,385 persons received 35,726 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio and Transcription Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a few years we have been looking forward to the time when the people in these islands would be able to hear your radio lectures broadcast on the air. With the single exception of a limited reception from Fecamp, Radio Normandie, no opportunity has arisen for the broadcasting of the message of truth. Now, however, by means of electrical transcription, the Lord has opened the way for your lectures to be heard over here. The reception by the public has been most encouraging, whether given in halls or in open spaces There are now 85 machines in regular operation, and 22 are on order for delivery as quickly as we can obtain them from the makers. It has taken a little time to organize the work, and so far there is only one complete month’s operations reported and only 59 out of 89 companies sent in the complete report. In this time 331 meetings were reported, 6,017 heard the three lectures ‘‘The Way of Escape”, ‘‘Holy Year” and ‘‘Kingdom Blessings”, and 2,613 pieces of literature were placed amongst them. The result of this month’s experiences indicates that the Lord’s blessing is undoubtedly upon this part of the work of the Kingdom. It also shows that there is every prospect of a large and effective witness’ being given in open spaces as well as in halls. The remnant are thrilled with the prospect, and we are kept busy filling the orders which continue to come in. Many companies are now carefully considering how they can equip themselves to share in the privilege. The small motor car which you purchased for the use of the office during your recent visit has been of the greatest assistance in enabling us to demonstrate to the companies the possibilities of the transcription broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two house-cars, which are now almost completed and fully equipped with the latest broadcasting apparatus, will undoubtedly give an effective witness in the small villages throughout the country. Whilst the radio has beyond doubt been greatly blessed by the Lord, we believe the transcription service will do an even more effective work, inasmuch as one comes immediately into close contact with the listener and an opportunity is provided for the placing of the literature without the necessity of their writing for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The office staff have been fully occupied throughout the year. The number of letters dispatched, 50,945, is a decrease of 2,301; and the number of letters received, 43,078, is a decrease of 10,168, compared with last year. This is due principally to the fact that the field workers report only once a month and, in addition, the monthly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4"> carry so much information concerning the field service that the friends do not require to write us so many letters of inquiry as heretofore. In the packing department 22,936 small parcels were packed and dispatched, a decrease of 4,071 on the previous year. The difference is due to the pioneers ’ and service \vorkers ’ requisitioning full cartons of literature wherever this is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The printing department has been exceptionally busy. The new power guillotine which you purchased for us has been a great boon. The Miehle press just met demands. This year’s item of 3,875,875 pieces is an increase of 826,835 pieces. The demand for transcription radio leaflets increases with every machine purchased. We shall soon require an additional Miehle to keep pace with the demand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> remains at the level of the past few years. To say that its regular visits are looked forward to with gladness would not sufficiently state the case; it is looked for eagerly and always with expectation, for it is known and fully realized that Jehovah definitely guides his people into his truth and his way mainly by it. It can be truly said of the brethren in tins part of the field that they undoubtedly realize themselves as a number of Jehovah’s people, separated unto him for his service, and the continued flow of light that the brethren here share with the remnant everywhere in the joy of the Lord; they are well fed and taught and, with an abundance of work to do, are a happy people, determined to go forward to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> remains about the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no great change to notify in the conditions of the people from that which was reported last year. The newspapers, speaking for big business rather than for the people whose interests they profess to seek, snatch at any little sign of freshening wind in the commercial world; but there is no optimism started nor hope kindled; rather there is a deepening feeling that things are going worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the message of the Kingdom is making some impression is frequently Been, but we anxiously look for much greater things when the peoples of these countries begin to realize that even vaunted Britain has no hope to come through its wise men, and they have definitely put the clergy out of reckoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Enclosed are the various statements giving details of the work above reported. We can confidently assure you of the love of the British friends for yourself, even as it was manifest in Liverpool by those present at the convention, and we send the love of the Bethel family here, to which we add our own, at the same time expressing our gratitude in being privileged to share in the work of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Canadian branch embraces all the provinces of Canada and Newfoundland. During most of the year the weather conditions are severe, but this does not dampen the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses. Hardships and persecution only sharpen their appetite for further opportunities to engage in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year Satan and his field marshal, Gog, have used the clergy and their earthly allies to hurl one assault after another against the faithful witnesses of Jehovah working in Canada. Many have been the acts of persecution against our brethren, and many of them have been haled into the courts. As this report is being written 29 of the faithful remnant are being tried before the courts of Quebec upon the charge of seditious conspiracy. What they did is this: A number of Jehovah’s witnesses went into Quebec and went from house to house to give away booklets containing the message of the Kingdom, namely, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory, The Crisis,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Way of Escape. </span><span class="font5">This greatly angered the Catholic hierarchy and for that reason the faithful servants of Jehovah God were arrested and brought into court. The result of that trial has not yet been announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren throughout Canada are earnest and zealous and, like the remnant elsewhere, are faithfully devoting themselves to a proclamation of the Kingdom message. In that land, as elsewhere, the clergy are the chief opponents of the truth, and these enemies of God have enlisted with them public officials to carry on a persecution against those who are earnestly and zealously trying to bear witness to the people, that they might learn of the great Jehovah, the true God, and of his kingdom through which all blessings must come to them. From the report of the local manager of Canada the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year swung open with the Kingdom Testimony Period, and into action went the Lord’s anointed bearing the fruits of the Kingdom to the people. Time marched on, and, with it, testimony period upon testimony period and special feature upon special feature of Kingdom service, each period and each service teeming with blessings for the Lord’s people. Added to these was the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> and the Booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font4"> all abounding m rich food, strength and comfort for the remnant, and as the year rolled by the enthusiasm and zeal of the fnends rose to great heights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As was to be expected, Satan and his forces have used every foul means imaginable to oppose the onward march of truth; but despite his every effort the Lord has caused </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">marvelous increase in the distribution of literature, and it is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">joy indeed to note that the number of books and booklets placed amounted to no less than 1,491,102 pieces, to compare with 902,890 last year; an increase of 588,212. To put the matter in terms of sixteen-page units, the placements of this year numbered 7,372,884, as against 5,734,588 last year; an increase of 1,638,290, or 28.5 percent. The placement of booklets showed an increase of 88 1 percent. This literature was spread among the people of 45 nationalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This wonderful result was obtained despite the fact that during six weeks of the year the friends were occupied almost exclusively in the radio campaign. On the other hand, of course, this special campaign aroused the interest of many and without doubt produced an increase in the placement of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average monthly army numbered 1,790 workers. These spent 474,893 hours in the field, gave 1,965,959 testimonies, and placed the Kingdom message in the hands of 520,409 people. Especially noteworthy is the large increase in the number of hours and the number of testimonies over last year. Last year the brethren spent 360,784 hours in the field and gave 1,794,855 testimonies, which means an increase for tlus year of 114,109 hours, or 31.6 percent, and 171,104 testimonies, or 9 5 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our testimonies objective for the year was 2,000,000, we reached, as above stated, 1,965,959. Our hours objective was 450,000; we reached 474,893. Our objective of average monthly workers was 1,610; an average of 1,790 was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends everywhere enthusiastically and loyally responded to the call for the united attacks upon Satan’s organization, and the results have been excellent in every respect. They were as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In order that the rulers as well as the people might receive the important testimony contained in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet, a special witness was made with this booklet in Ottawa, Canada, and St. John’s, Newfoundland, the capital cities of these two countries. In Ottawa, parliament was in session at the time, and it was necessary to lay the plans very carefully in order to complete the work in the government buildings before the officials became aware thereof. Envelopes containing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font4">booklet and marked ‘ ‘ Personal ’ ’ were addressed to the governor general and his secretaries and aids-de-camp, the prime minister, the privy council, senators, members of parliament, deputy ministers, the railway commission, the radio commission, the defense council, the pensions tribunal, the supreme court, the exchequer court and all government secretaries, chief clerks, principal clerks, etc., whose office entitles them to a standing above that of an ordinary clerk or stenographer; also to the local judges, editors of the newspapers, the papal delegate, all the clergy, bank managers and heads of the large financial institutions, the mayor and controllers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the morning the workers, strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, visitbd the government buildings. When stopped by the government policemen they would tactfully leave, only to reappear later on another floor. As one worker was put out others continued the work, and the policemen had a merry time. By noon no serious difficulty had been encountered and 1,000 of the officials had been personally presented with a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By this time, however, the rulers had taken counsel together and in the afternoon definitely stopped the work, so that it was impossible to proceed. A further attempt was made m some of the buildings the next morning, but it became apparent that instructions had been issued to stop the workers, and little progress was made. The clergy and others not located in the government buildings received their copies personally also, and the remainder were mailed. All together, about 2,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font4">booklets were delivered in this manner and created quite a stir. The campaign aroused wide discussion among those receiving the booklet, and, coming as it did on the heels of the tremendous witness given to the rulers in connection with the banning of your radio lectures m this country, and with parliament still in session, proved a further great testimony against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time in St. John’s, Newfoundland, copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet were personally presented to 117 clergymen, 20 politicians and 113 professional and other leading men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the close of September, and in harmony with your authorization, a special campaign was thoroughly organized for an attack upon the city of Quebec. This is the citadel of the Boman Catholic church in this land, from which point they dominate not alone the vanous activities of the province of Quebec but also to a large measure the politics, finance and other activities of the people throughout this entire land. The outcome of that attack, and the success thereof, will be reported to you, the Lord willing, in the next annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of pioneers in the field this year shows a decided increase over that of last year, the average monthly being 173, as against an average weekly last year of 152. The largest number reporting in any one month totaled 226. This army of faithful and zealous workers accomplished a mighty witness by the Lord’s grace, and this despite the most terrible economic depression this land has known Satan’s instruments have hurled their forces against them time and time again, but they have met the onslaughts with a fortitude and courage enjoyed only by those having an abounding faith in Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A particular manifestation of the Lord’s watchcare over those who are daily engaged in the front ranks of the battle was the special arrangement made by you whereby the accounts of the pioneers were credited with certain amounts according to the length of time spent in continuous service. The pioneer brethren deeply appreciated this provision, and it indeed served to spur them on to greater zeal in the Kingdom service. Many wrote advising that had it not been for this they would not have been able to continue in the work. With equal gratitude have they received word of the bound-book credit allowances, and these too are of very great assistance to them, particularly in these times, when contributions of produce are so generally received and little cash is handled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results of the pioneer brethren as compared with last year’s were as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In harmony with the policy now pursued for some years, and which has been richly blessed of the Lord, during the winter months the pioneers were divided into various camps, each camp coming under the direction of a regional service director, and assigned to sene in the large cities In each center a house was rented to accommodate the brethren. During the summer months somewhat the same policy has been followed in working the rural territory, so far as possible all being accommodated m automobiles with their own camping equipment. The results of this arrangement have been splendid. Having the pioneers grouped m this way stimulates and enthuses them in the battle, and particularly is this so during the long winter months, when the weather is extremely cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to these camps there have, of course, been many of the brethren working individually in territory not suitable for camp activity, and these brethren, generally speaking, have their own cars. Two brothers, however, who were unable to provide themselves with a car, reading of the activities of the Japanese friends, decided to follow their example. They constructed a light trailer on two wheels, .the walls and pitched roof made of light slats placed several inches apart and the whole covered with a canvas cover made to fit. This they pull along by hand from one point to another, leave it parked in one place while they work out from it on foot, covering the surrounding territory, and then move on to another base of operation. It is very light to handle and has been found very satisfactory, even in hilly country, and the most economical way of carrying on the work. During the months it has been in operation it has never been molested in any form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies, Auxiliaries and Sharpshooters</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never in the history of the church has there been such unity and zeal among the company workers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters as today. It seems that the drones have been plucked out, and the faithful remnant have zealously done their part in bearing testimony to the glad tidings of the Kingdom and heralding forth the message of God’s judgment against Satan’s forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When but a few months of the present fiscal year had passed the anger of Satan, and of his field marshal, Gog, at the spread of the message of truth m this land, was clearly manifested by the anger of his earthly representatives m their action through the Radio Commission in banning your transcription lectures from the air. As you are aware, this action was taken by the rulers here at the instigation of the Anglican clergy on January 18 and immediately, under your instructions, a mighty campaign of protest was put into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It commenced with the widespread distribution throughout the country of 1,125,000 English, 175,000 French, and 50,000 Ukrainian copies of an ‘IMPORTANT NOTICE to the People’, signed by yourself, wherein the people were informed of the truth concerning the matter and the clergy challenged to select one amongst their number to debate the question: ‘ That the clergymen of the Anglican church, contrary to their claim, do not in fact represent Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and his kingdom, but that they do represent and serve Satan the Devil, and that thereby the people are deceived.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A monstrous petition was then circulated from coast to coast, to which 406,270 names weic signed, and wide publicity was given thereto in the newspapers Parliament was flooded with letters of protest, and many more appeared in the press Mass meetings were held throughout the country at which resolutions were passed protesting the action of the Commission, and a large number of labor organizations and other advocates of freedom of speech passed similar resolutions and forwarded these to the members of parhament for their constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As would be expected, Satan had his representatives busy, and attempts were made to prevent the meetings ’ being held, and theaters were refused on every hand, but, with one exception, suitable halls or theaters were eventually obtained and attentive audiences unanimously passed the lesolutions presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many false charges were made by the enemy in Parhament and in the press, and as these appeared they were denied by statements of facts forwarded to all members of Parliament, senators, newspapers and radio stations, etc. Your personal letter to one member of Parliament was read by him in the House and caused much debate, and Parliament was greatly disturbed over the magnitude of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally, as a culmination to the whole campaign, the petition was presented to Parhament, and two of the Society’s representatives interviewed the prime minister and gave him a strong witness concerning the Kingdom, testifying to the fact that any government officials who would set themselves in opposition to the Kingdom by opposing the Kingdom message did so at their own peril. The prime minister promised to have the Radio Commission appear before him and to look thoroughly into the matter with a view to taking the proper action; but to this date he has done nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the thick of the campaign your three stirring lectures, “Way of Escape,’’ “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity,” and “Kingdom Blessings for the People”, which were broadcast over large hook-ups in the United States on April 16, 23 and 30, through stations so strategically located along the border, were heard in Canada with great clearness and truly resulted in a mighty blow against Satan’s forces, showing up the unreasonableness of the action of the Radio Commission. Your so completely ignoring the chairman of the Commission, not even taking sufficient notice of him to mention his name, was truly becoming the dignity of the message of truth and could not help but be noted by many. When these lectures were again broadcast by electrical transcription, on June 18, 25 and July 2, they were well received in Canada, and did much to further the witness and prepare the ground for the placing of the message in printed form, namely, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In harmony with your instructions the matter of broadcasting your electrical records by transcription machines was placed before the friends and immediate steps were taken to manufacture suitable machines for the purpose. This new feature of service was laid hold upon by the companies and pioneers in this country with much enthusiasm, and at this writing orders have been received for eiglity-four machines, of which practically all are now filled and the machines are in operation from coast to coast. The first of these were placed in the hands of the friends in June, and the results thus far are very gratifying. Particularly is this true of the meetings held in the smaller villages and in rural territory. The number of meetings arranged to date is 598; the total attendance, 36,563; making an average of 63 for each meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems very timely that in this country, where the Radio Commission has such autocratic control and has so unjustly ruled your transcriptions from the air, this means of giving the message should be provided of the Lord. It is truly receiving his rich blessing, and the work has only begun. The letters received from the friends reporting their experiences in this part of the work have been very interesting indeed, and I have pleasure in quoting from two of these as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Just a line or two to say how we are getting along with the transcription machine. It is sure a wonder. If one could not see he might believe that Judge Rutherford was right there in the building. Many people ask, when we announce the lecture, if we have Judge Rutherford with us. Then, of course, we explain the machine. Splendid attention is given each time. We are very grateful for these wonderful privileges. ’ ’—Pioneer, Alberta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Meeting held August 4, in a private yard. ‘The Way of Escape’ went over great, and several of the listeners said it was the best talk they had ever heard. We counted at least 125 present, and they all showed keen interest. At the close of the lecture we asked those who had enjoyed the meeting and who would like to hear another lecture the following Friday to raise the right hand. The vote was almost unanimous therefor. A Frenchman living on the street back of where we were offered his place for the next meeting. He said the talk was the best he had ever heard. We are looking forward with joy to this privilege of again being able to praise and honor the name of Jehovah. ’ ’—Company, Ontario.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">General</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the unemployment situation becoming more serious day by day, during the early part of the year the rulers were driven to put forth a special effort to cope therewith. In their frenzy they adopted one scheme upon another, but, like a man in a bog who tries to extricate himself, things have gone from bad to worse. This, of course, is as we should expect. The world has ended; it is now experiencing its death pains; and soon the Lord by his mighty power will destroy the wicked organization of Satan from the earth and bring the blessings, so long promised, to humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As I have traveled from place to place visiting the different companies the friends everywhere have expressed a desire that I should convey to you their love and greeting, and I have much pleasure in so doing. Recognizing and appreciating greatly the burdens and multitudinous duties placed upon you they do not feel inclined to urge you to visit them, but, nevertheless, would greatly appreciate it if in the Lord’s providence you could so do. Therefore in that spirit we all extend to you a very warm and earnest invitation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>AFRICA (East and South)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch office for East Africa and South Africa is situated at Cape Town. The major portion of the witnessing in that part of the earth is done in South Africa. During the year Jehovah has greatly blessed the efforts of his witnesses in that section of the field. The increase in the work required the obtaining of more commodious premises for office and shipping purposes. The report shows that the comparatively small number of witnesses not only have been busy during the year, but have accomplished much good to the glory of Jehovah. This is evident notwithstanding the world depression. The output of books and booklets in East Africa and South Africa exceeded last year’s total by more than 60,000. The total for 1932 was 131,792, the total books and booklets for 1933, 196,553. This distribution of the Kingdom message has been made in nineteen different languages, to wit, English, Afrikaans, Hollandish, Portuguese, German, Lithuanian, Hindi, Arabic, Chinyanja, French, Yiddish, Dano-Norwegian, Urdu, Chinese, Greek, Italian, Gujerati, Tamil, and Xosa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Attention is called to the facts stated in this report of the opposition of the Catholic hierarchy, particularly with reference to St. Helena and other islands of the sea, where the Catholics have kept the people in ignorance and oppressed them for a long while and now vigorously oppose their being enlightened at all concerning God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following extract is from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">House-to-House Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The house-to-house witness work continues to be the most effective way of advertising the Kingdom and bearing testimony concerning Jehovah’s Word and name. It gives pleasure to report a big increase over the figures for last year. At the beginning of the year we set a quota of 250,000 testimonies, which figure was in excess of that given the previous year by 56,000. Some thought that we were too optimistic, but, as the table which follows, and which has been compiled from reports actually submitted to the office, indicates, we have surpassed the quota, with something to spare.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After using the various broadcasting stations in this country for twelve months, the opportunity to give out the Kingdom message by that means ceased. An advisory committee on religious broadcasts, composed of representatives of the various “orthodox” churches, was formed and this bunch of Satan’s sons has ruled that no opportunity whatsoever can be given to the people of this country to hear the truth concerning the establishment of God’s kingdom. At the very time these representatives of the devil religion made their decision to abuse their newly acquired power by preventing the people from hearing the truth over the air, announcement was made of the transcription machines. It is clearly evident that the Lord saw the need for this new avenue of service and just at the precise moment furnished that need. While Satan’s representatives were still gloating over what they thought was a master stroke, arrangements were under way to open the campaign with the transcription machines in Cape Town. Opportunity was taken by every means possible (leaflets, window cards, posters, banners on cars, news ads, etc.) to let the people of Cape Town know what was taking place. As a result of this vigorous “hand-clapping”, a hall in the main thoroughfare was filled and the audience was informed why they could no longer hear Judge Rutherford’s talks over the air. It was apparent that the clergy had not many supporters in the hall, and many people of good will expressed'pleasure m this wonderful new instrument the Lord had graciously provided for instructing the people and also their satisfaction in knowing that the people of this country were going to be informed of the diabolical action of the clergy. The good work begun m Cape Town will be carried on m every town and dorp in the land. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are some wonderful opportunities for pioneering in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">great continent like this. Numbered amongst Jehovah’s witnesses m South Africa there are those with the real pioneering spirit, men and women who are devoted to Jehovah and who are ready to go anywhere and to face any danger or difficulty that they may encounter in their performance of the will of God. The work within the borders of the Union has gone steadily forward, and although the distress and poverty amongst certain sections of the people have become worse, there has been a very considerable increase in the placements of literature. With several additional workers in the field, we cover the territory more rapidly than hitherto. This is done with good results. Our work is becoming better known, and although this means increased opposition in certain quarters, people of good will can more readily discern the great question at issue and are taking a definite stand on the side of Jehovah. The pioneers who have transcription machines find them a great asset in arousing interest. As they establish contact with the audience on the spot, placements, which are the direct result of transcription lectures, should be much more numerous than when the talks were broadcast and one had to find the interested. In one of the first reports to reach the office two pioneers, who have been working Swaziland, report that the king of the Swazi people turned out to be a real Jonadab. He gave the pioneers a royal welcome. His personal bodyguard of 100 warriors was assembled at the royal court while a talk and a musical selection were put over. The king and his chief secretary expressed appreciation of the Kingdom message and readily availed themselves of the opportunity to secure copies of all the Society’s publications and to subscribe for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past twelve months we have again penetrated beyond the borders of the Union, and pioneers have worked for the first time Bechuanaland Protectorate and Portuguese East Africa. Great distances, over roads which are none too good in parts, had to be traversed to reach the comparatively small number of people living in these far-flung territories. But one of Henry Ford’s latest outfits stood the test, and so did the J. w’s. The courageous pioneers, who gave an excellent witness m these lands, made good use of all available literature in English and Portuguese. The isles of the sea are not being overlooked, and the witness was given for the first time in St. Helena, on the West Atlantic, and Mauritius and Madagascar, which lie off the east coast of Africa. There are only 80 Europeans on St. Helena, and the remainder are a mixed people and poverty-stricken. Books and booklets numbering 800 are now circulating amongst the 4,000 inhabitants of that lonely isle of the sea, while </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> will be a regular visitor for the ensuing twelve months. The inhabitants of Mauritius and Madagascar are chiefly French-speaking, although there are many Indians and some Chinese Europeans are few m number and are either sugar planters or holding down government billets. A very considerable number of laborers are a mixed people known as Creoles. The majority are illiterate and have little or nothing of this world’s goods. This is not surprising, however, when one knows that Catholic pi tests rule in these islands with a rod of iron. These men did everything in their power to impede the work of the Lord, and the Catholic newspapers earned warning notices urging the people not to take the Society’s literature. A prominent representative of big business boasted that he would use all his influence to get the two pioneers (to use his elegant language) “kicked off the island’’. This effort, needless to say, failed, and a very thorough witness was given in these islands in spite of all opposition directed against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliaries and Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The figures heretofore submitted show that there has been a further improvement m these branches of the service, and there has been a very considerable increase in the number of permit holders. During the year the invitation extended to the Jonadab class to share in the work has resulted in quite a number of people of good will coming forward and joining with us in the witness work. This has been particularly the case during the special campaign periods. The time has surely come when all who love the Lord must take a definite stand on his side and be identified by their course of action. The zeal manifested by some of the Jonadab class should be an incentive to any who under the stress of a number of years ’ campaigning are tempted to become slack and weary in welldoing. The steady growth in the volume of the work is briefly summarized in the table which follows, and which covers the past four years:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaign Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These special seasons of thanksgiving have been occasions of great joy. The enthusiasm of the friends has been most marked, and this reached a climax during the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, which effort easily surpassed any other to date and resulted m an average placement of 90 books and booklets per worker. We desire to express appreciation of the fact that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> dealing with this campaign reached this outpost in good time to find its way into the hands of all workers prior to the commencement of the attack. We feel confident that that fact, coupled with the excellent testimony furnished for use in connection with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and the united action of the brethren, had much to do with the success of that campaign. Our figures for the five campaigns are given herewith, and a comparison is made with last year’s figures:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new English booklets were released for the campaign work m May, and in the four months we have been using them they have been going out literally by the (baker’s) dozen In these days, when the cry is frequently for something ‘ ‘ short and snappy”, these booklets meet the bill, and the simple, clear and concise treatises they contain are going to perform a big work in educating the people of good will and helping them to understand the great issue </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> Books Two and Three have also been going out well since we got them, while </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> Book One has been the most widely distributed amongst the bound volumes. As that book contains in a special way the message of the hour, this is just as it should be. Five new booklets m native languages have opened up the native field very considerably, and these have brought great joy and much enlightenment to many truth-hungry ones in the Union, the Ehodesias and Nyasaland. Six of the new booklets have been translated into Afrikaans, and we look forward to handling these also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three brethren in the office continue to appreciate the privilege of working here. It has been a full year and a happy one. Approximately 5,000 letters were received, and a similar number dispatched, while 3,000 circular letters and an equal number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4"> were sent out. The brother in the store has also had his hands fully occupied. Now that the transcription meetings have begun, our little printing press is being kept busy running off leaflets and window cards, etc. We do not let our work in the office crowd out our opportunities for field service, as the undernoted figures bear out:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">During the year we have been greatly refreshed and encouraged by the stirring articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and the devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses in other lands, as reported in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> from time to time, has provoked the little company here to love and good works. With the enemy cordon closing in around the remnant we know not what the new year will bring forth, but we go forward from day to day singing Jehovah’s praises, assured of his protection and that his hand will remain over his little ones until this gospel of the Kingdom shall have been preached m all the world as a witness unto all nations and that then shall follow the destruction of the enemy and the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In that part of West Africa under the control of the British Empire, particularly Nigeria and the Gold Coast, Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have been doing a work during the year and received the rich blessing of the Lord. The climatic conditions are such as make it difficult for one to retain his physical strength and go on with the work; yet these faithful brethren, against odds of sickness, and much persecution received from the clergy, continue to put forth their best endeavors to obey the commandment to preach this gospel of the Kingdom. Two of the brethren in that land had been sent to prison for preaching the gospel, but after the chief justice of the court heard the cases they were reversed and the brethren discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books placed in the hands of the people aggregate 10,779; booklets, 54,076 From the local manager’s report, the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Yoruba-speaking brethren and also the Jonadab class thank you, Brother Rutherford, for translating the books and booklets into their own dialect. Many blind eyes are opening, surely in fulfilment of Isaiah 35; and therefore the venom of the clergy class increases, and also of the principal of the flock; but up to the present the African friends are dauntless of what may happen. They are pushing forward with confidence that victory is sure by Jehovah’s executive officer, Christ Jesus.—Rev. 19: 19, 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of reduction of salary, retrenchment and financial difficulties, the people are not obtaining the books as formerly, but the booklets are having a steady run, and whenever the witness is given the people listen more attentively. But even now, in spite of financial difficulties, if the clergy class were off the scene, the books would go rapidly. However, we bide the Lord’s time for the fulfilment of Jeiemiah 25, from verse 32 onward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you are aware, up to the present time we have two transcription machines on the west coast of Africa They are doing a good work in the homes of the people and other places. We would have done more work with them in the city of Lagos if all the public halls were not locked against us through the efforts of the clergy. However, a wider witness will be given when the other two arrive, one for the Gold Coast and the other for Freetown, Sierra Leone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 76 public lectures were held in English and Yoruba, with a total attendance of 9,880. Company meetings, 280, with an attendance of 2,950. Letters received, 390; dispatched, 410. The total number of books sent out from the office to the pioneers, auxiliaries and class workers throughout the west coast of Africa aggregated 10,779 and 54,076 booklets. This makes a grand total of 64,885 books and booklets, which is an increase of 28,420 over the previous year. In addition, over 18,000 handbills were distributed for advertising public lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dear Brother Rutherford, we rejoice to know that even on this dark continent the waters of truth are rising high and higher. The anointed remnant on earth, seeing the temple of God and the waters of truth flowing out therefrom, voice the sentiment of the psalmist David, “Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the Argentine Republic of South America, the Society maintains an office at Buenos Aires. The workers there are small in number, but, of course, the scope of the work is very limited. There has been some progress during the year, however. There have been 128 radio lectures delivered personally and by electrical transcription, and for the purpose of advertising these, 108,590 folders were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total number of books and booklets put in the hands of the people during the year is, to wit, 45,959, which is an increase of 12,000 over last year. There are 19 pioneers engaged in the work, and these, together with the other workers, number 95, all told. During the year three pioneers went from the United States and have begun the work in that country. The economic conditions in Argentina are very bad. The brethren, therefore, work under a great handicap, but are pushing on against opposition and doing their best in giving praise to the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The large territory of Australia, New Zealand and the South Sea Islands is included in the Society’s branch office at Strathfield, from which point the work is directed. Jehovah’s witnesses there manifested great zeal and earnestness during the past year, and the Lord has blessed them richly, as this report discloses. The clergy and their allies have put forth vigorous efforts to prevent the broadcasting of the Kingdom message by radio, but in the face of all this opposition twenty-four radio stations continue to broadcast and the Lord has brought into action in addition thereto a number of transcription machines which proclaim the same Kingdom message and which are accomplishing much good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The distribution of books and booklets for 1932 totaled 629,187, and for 1933, 736,002, thus showing a healthy increase. The people of good will are learning that now they may have an opportunity to carry the message to the people, and the witness work goes grandly forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year just concluded has shown an expansion in every phase of the work in this territory. The increased activities have drawn the fire of the enemy, so that in all parts the clergy, by publishing false statements and misrepresentations in their church magazines, are desperately attempting to prevent the people from heeding the Kingdom message. Their course only serves to identify them as fighting under Satan’s banner, and the people are having their eyes opened to the truth. The increase in the work has made necessary additional office and store accommodation. A suitable building, comprising two floors, has now been completed by consecrated hands, and we are grateful to Jehovah for this evidence of his blessing upon the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers are also very grateful for the provision made for them by the Lord through the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following summary shows the progress of the work during the year, and also gives a comparative statement which indicates the tremendous increase in the output of hterature during the past four years:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Two regional service directors </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have been </span><span class="font4">regularly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font4">field, and during the year have traveled a total of 16,135 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The five special testimony periods held during the year were noteworthy m that, while the total time of these periods was 37 days, or approximately 10 percent of the year, they were responsible for nearly 20 percent of the total literature placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the year’s total number of books and booklets, the pioneers accounted for 500,117, the auxiliaries for 67,561, and the companies and sharpshooters for 168,324.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reduced distribution of bound books reflects, in some measure, the difficult times the people are experiencing. Another contributing factor would be the inclusion of two booklet campaigns in the special periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Assemblies for Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two general service assemblies were held during the year, one at Wellington, New Zealand, and the other at Melbourne, Australia. At each of these gatherings there was a good representation of the friends of the two countries. The New Zealand assembly was marked by the launching of a great campaign of protest against the action of the Radio Board in prohibiting the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford’s lectures, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">the people are being informed of the reason why the elergy desire to prevent them from hearing the truth. The Melbourne assembly covered the period of the distnbution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and towns within a radius of 50 miles ot the city -were literally taken by storm. During that happy period, Jehovah’s witnesses bore testimony to the people on the streets, at the houses, on trams and trains, and in every possible place. A day was set aside for a large party to visit Ballarat, a town 70 miles from Melbourne, where considerable opposition has been manifested The result of the assembly was very gratifying, 52,019 testimonies being given and 17,530 pieces of literature being placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although, during the year, Satan, through the clergy, has induced one or two stations to cease broadcasting the Kingdom message, there are still twenty-four stations regularly on the air with Judge Rutherford’s lectures. The special broadcast of &quot;The Way of Escape’’, “Holy Year” and “Kingdom Blessings” lectures, in which twenty-three stations participated, has just been completed These were acknowledged by all as the most thrilling speeches ever heard and are the staiting point of an ever widening circle of activity by means of the transcription machines shortly to be placed in commission in Australia. We are enthused by the onward march of the Lord’s little army as indicated by the reports received from the main front at headquarters, and we are determined to do our part in lifting high the standard of truth against the Devil’s flood of lies so that those who will may leaia of the way of escape and follow on to safety in the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Adelaide the clergy induced the ladio officials to take action. They commanded that we cease broadcasting the lectures, and the government threatened to confiscate the radio station if the lectures were continued As a result of a great campaign of protest organized by Jehovah’s witnesses, thousands of people of good will expressed their indignation at the action of the government. Additionally, there has followed a greatly increased output of litciature as a consequence One newspaper, in a fnendly article, wants to know why the government prohibits in one state lectures which it still allows to be broadcast in the five other states</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ELECTRICAL TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES have been in use for some time by the various companies, and the placing of much literature has resulted However, we are only on the fnnge of this woik, and we are looking forward to a mighty</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">witness’ being given by means of these machines throughout the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE PIONEERS are finding the grouping system a great boon in these difficult times. Living and transport costs are cut to a minimum, enabling workers to remain in the field, and real fellowship in Jehovah’s service is enjoyed. All the territory is systematically worked and more easily controlled. The largest group operating is located in Sydney and has 28 members. On several occasions this group has tried all-night witnessing. Workers operate in relays and are placed at points where people are likely to be met The results were encouraging, and books were placed throughout the night. One worker placed a complete set of books at 4 am.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart from the capital cities in the six states there are few large towns in Australia. The territory consists in the main of small towns, scattered villages, farming, mining and timber areas. In the interior of the continent and in a large portion of Western Australia are great sheep and cattle stations where the homesteads are as far as 100 miles apart. These sparsely populated areas are now receiving the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An idea of the size of Australia will be gathered from the distances to be traveled from the Strathfield office to reach the. various state capital cities. These are as follows: Brisbane, to the north, 700 miles; Melbourne, to the south, 583 miles; Adelaide, to the south and west, 1,071 miles; Perth, on the west coast, 2,748 miles; Hobart, on the island of Tasmama, 946 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NEW ZEALAND is 1,200 miles to the eastward of Sydney. In these islands there is much opposition to the Kingdom message. A government-appointed board, upon which the clergy are represented, controls broadcasting Thus, in the domain of this “whelp” of the seventh world power, no broadcasting of the Kingdom message is permitted, on the plea that it is ‘controversial’. To offset this opposition, much has been done to arrange meetings for the presentation of Brother Rutherford ’s electrical transcription lectures. In this way the people are hearing the truth and are told why lectures they can hear from Australian radio stations are prohibited in New Zealand. As an effective means of advertising these lectures, Jehovah’s witnesses have formed processions of cars, caravans and bicycles, having notices of the meetings attached. In the south island of New Zealand, a traveling group of thirteen pioneers is operating. They sweep through the territory and, where opposition exists, they are in and out of town before the Devil's crowd wake up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE WORK IN THE ISLANDS still progresses satisfactorily. Many difficulties have to be met by those who work in these parts. During the year the ranks of the island workers were depleted by the death of a pioneer brother. Recently, however, others have taken up the work in the island service, and a boat will shortly be placed in commission, which should result in a great increase in the work in this part of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IN JAVA a radio station has now commenced broadcasting the truth in both the English and Dutch languages. Brother Rutherford’s electrical transcription lectures provide the English broadcasts. Lectures in the Dutch language are read by a gentleman interested in the truth Much interest has been aroused as a result, and increased placements have been made. The witness is also being given in Sumatra, and in a few weeks 981 pieces of literature were placed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries, Austria has been one of the dark spots on earth because the Catholic commercial religion has predominated and kept the people in ignorance. These opponents of Jehovah and his kingdom continue to resist every effort of the faithful witnesses of the Most High to carry the message to the people. They are not able to succeed, however, because during the year the witness work has increased in Austria and many more people are becoming enlightened to the fact that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total number of witnesses engaged in the work in that country during the fiscal year 1933 was €01. During the Thanksgiving testimony period 42,000 books and booklets were distributed amongst the people. During the year these workers engaged 84,247 hours in the service and placed in the hands of the people, bound books 27,975, booklets 234,098, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> 49,461, Bibles 556. This showed a decided increase of distribution of literature over the previous year. The total amount of books and booklets distributed during the year aside from Bibles and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazines, is, to wit, 262,073.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local manager’s report contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We used the Creation pictures without films as a means of advertising the Kingdom. Much interest was shown and a number of new compames were organized. We rented the biggest halls we could get, and in each case the halls were filled to capacity and many were turned away at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In several places regional service meetings were held, which served to encourage the brethren. A larger convention was planned, but on account of the political unrest it had to be postponed. Brother Rutherford, whose visit we had anticipated with joy, could not come, but he sent the two brothers Knorr and Harbeck to represent him. It was a wonderful occasion and it stimulated the friends. A Resolution was passed concerning the Declaration which Brother Rutherford wrote while in Europe, and this is now being distributed to counteract the influence of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are glad that the Society owns a property to house the workers, and the organization formerly registered as an Austrian society is now registered as a branch office of the American Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and this has helped us in maintaining our stand in the face of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have our own small printing machine to print leaflets and small printed matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We received 2,804 pieces of mail and dispatched 1,266.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Jehovah’s people have increased their efforts to give the witness, we observe that God’s enemy, the Devil, and his representative, Gog, are doing everything possible to hinder tlie work. Brethren are arrested, their literature and money are taken from them, and recently the holding of meetings was also forbidden in some places. The government of Austria is largely Catholic and has issued a special decree forbidding political meetings, and tlus law they try to use against us. In Giaz, the second largest eity of Austna, there is a group of 250 to 300 people who have come to the meetings regularly since the Creation pictures were shown, and these meetings were forbidden. We protested, and two days later the measure forbidding the meetings was canceled. Then in a prominent newspaper the government was requested to forbid our woik. Several pioneers were expelled, and every week we have to answer false accusations brought up against us. We trust in Jehovah to be able to work as long as it pleases Him, and He expects us to do whatever is within our power to stand our giound as long as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Austria was always a Catholic country, but now efforts are put forth to make everything Catholic The laws and intei national agreements of Austria are in our favor, but since the paiLament has ceased to function, the government can use dictatorial poweis. However, we are pleased to state that the brethren, in spite of the greater difficulties, are marching on with joy to serve Jehovah</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The small country of Belgium has received and is receiving a witness with the Kingdom message Jehovah’s witnesses there are small in number but are zealous in performing their commission. They have put forth greater efforts during this fiscal year than heretofore. This they have done amidst much opposition. The Lord at all times, however, has manifested h s blessing upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 12 pioneers working m Belgium, 5 auxiliaries, and 32 regular and 20 occasional company workers. All these pioneers, except one, are foreigners and know little or nothing of the languages spoken in Belgium. They have put in 27,179 hours in the field and distributed 5,331 books, 141,458 booklets and 11,079 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> Some of these work as much as 150 hours per month. They are all poor in this world’s goods, but are rich in the Lord. The company workers spent 5,398 hours in the service. They distributed 23,266 booklets, 656 books, 3,850 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> and 51 Bibles. The total number of books and booklets distributed from the Belgium office during the year is, to wit, 6,322 books, 172,467 booklets. In addition thereto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 13,354 copies was distributed, and 171 Bibles were placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief event was doubtless the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font4">booklet. Amongst the Belgian people 46,300 were distributed. The Thanksgiving Week was our best time. The Feast of Jehovah spurred us on to great zeal, for during that week 69 workers participated and distributed 14,553 books and booklets This accomplishment is better than the result of the year 1929, which was 12,939 pieces of literature. The other service weeks were also attended with greater efforts. Three regional service meetings were held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The population of Belgium is largely Catholic, and the rural population is very much under the control of the clergy; but in the industrial sections this influence is waning. Religious festivals, memorials and processions celebrating an old bone of a so-called ‘ ‘ saint ’ ’ keep the people in a stupor and religious delirium. The greatest thing this year was the apparition of the “mother of god” in some obscure village. From 60,000 up to 150,000 people are gathering now daily on this spot and bring their sick, hoping to have them healed, and they do pot know how the Devil deceives them. But the clergy of another place of pilgrimage envies the prospering business of the new undesirable competition and warns the people not to go there. With astonishment we read the report in the newspapers that at a place known as a resort the “mother of god” had appeared again. Probably someone tried to help out the tourist trade, for it was found out that the apparition was caused by the reflex of an elect: ic lamp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Often the priests </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font4"> from house to house and gather the books after one of Jehovah’s witnesses has visited the residents, but there are many reports of those who are glad to hear the message and who ask for more literature, for the schemes of the priests, when found out, work against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Next year we can also add a radio-work report, because we have just now closed a contract for the use of a small radio station in Belgium</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “evil servant’’ class is also represented here and designates our books as ‘sacnlegious literature’. Brother Rutherford will remember having visited a convention in Belgium in 1913. Of those present at that tune only five continue to walk in the light. Two of these are auxiliary pioneers. They are old in years but young in the strength of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the police we had less difficulty than in the past year. In two cases brethren have used the defense as suggested in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Booh</span><span class="font4"> and they were acquitted, while in the past year, m spite of the assistance of two paid-for attorneys, two unfavorable verdicts were rendered.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society continues to serve the blind who are interested in the Kingdom message, even though this service is quite small. It maintains a depot for this purpose at Logansport, Indiana. There has been increased interest from the blind during the year. Several have heard the message by radio and have asked for books and received them. All the literature to the blind is loaned and, as the major portion of this is done through the Chicago library, it is difficult to know just how many are interested There are some subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> which is printed in the Braille language for the benefit of the blind, while others are loaned the literature. When we keep in mind the large bulk of paper that must be employed to print even a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font5"> in the Braille language, we can see that there is a great deal of work attached to this, even though the number of readers is small. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> thus cut in the Braille for the blind is sent to the following countries: Australia, South Africa, England and Scotland, Canada, in addition to those used in the United States.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The peoples of Brazil generally speak the Portuguese language; yet there are many other languages spoken there, by people who have emigrated to Brazil. The Society’s workers are few in number there. One hundred seventeen partook of the Memorial, but only 31 entered the service, thus showing that many have a lack of appreciation of their privileges of serving the Lord. However, the radio has been used in a very limited way in Rio de Janeiro and Santos; but its use provoked the clergy to greater opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Portuguese language books placed in the hands of the people totaled 702, booklets, 11,453; and in 21 other languages, 248 books and 2,063 booklets; making a total of 950 books and 14,218 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tariff revenue is so very high on books coming into Brazil that it was found necessary to do printing by private contract in that country. During the latter part of the fiscal year, therefore, booklets were printed in Brazil as follows- </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font5"> 50,000; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font5"> 20,000; other publications, 20,752. There are four of the Bethel family who are engaged in the service and who reside together as a family. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is published in Portuguese and distributed amongst those who are deeply interested in the truth. Forty-eight meetings were held during the year, with an attendance of 249.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As is well known, Brazil has been for many years kept in the dark by the Catholic system; and we are happy to report that the light is beginning to break through.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The small country of British Guiana, in the north</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ern </span><span class="font5">portion of South America, is receiving the witness of the Kingdom. The Society has a depot at Georgetown, Demerara, from which this work is conducted. The number of workers is small, but they are zealous in pushing forward and doing what they can to bear witness to the truth. The people are not much inclined to read, but are interested in hearing lectures. Eight public lectures were delivered by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">brother sent there during the year, with an attendance of 854. There are six pioneers in the field, and 24 others who give part time to the service. During the year they have placed in the hands of the people, bound books, 1,746, booklets, 11,083.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has found it advantageous to have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">general office in Central Europe to look after certain divisions of the work. This office is maintained at Bern, Switzerland. The manager gives a general review of the countries under the jurisdiction of that office, which include, to wit, Austria, Belgium, France, Holland, Italy, Poland, Rumania, Sarre Basin, Switzerland and Yugoslavia This general review submits figures of distribution of literature which are not to be taken into consideration m arriving at the grand total throughout the earth, for the reason that these same figures are set out under the respective countries named and are there taken into the grand total.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other things, the manager of the Central European office says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following two scriptures well describe our experiences during the past year: “They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets. . . . They pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.” “But with us is [Jehovah] our God, to help us, and to fight our battles.” (Lam. 4:18,19; 2 Chron. 32:8) From the begi</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nni</span><span class="font4">ng of the year there were evidences that the Devil was angry because of the success of the work reported last year; and it was to be expected that he would hunt the steps of his enemies, the faithful witnesses of the Lord. His wrath was poured out particularly against the pioneers in France, Belgium, Holland and Austria. The political condition between Germany and the mentioned countries had become so unfavorable that many of the German pioneers were watched more closely by the eyes of the strong-arm squad in the countries friendly with France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The difficulties began when, last year, 11 German pioneers were sent out of Paris. During the course of the year others were expelled, and of 24 German pioneers in France only 9 are still permitted to reside in that country. In the spring of 1933 German pioneers were sent also out of Belgium, Holland and Austria; but others took their places. Those who remained in the field, being informed of these difficulties, increased their zeal, redoubled their efforts, and thus redeemed the time, as the report shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the pioneers experienced difficulties on account of the international political conditions, the companies reported that by working the territory three and four times during the year, and because of general conditions’ getting worse, the distribution of books had become more difficult. In many sections the opposition has become stronger, particularly during the last few months. The police authorities have taken stronger measures against us, and they were no doubt encouraged by the newspaper reports of the condition of our work in Germany and did not look favorably upon the increased activity of the company workers. Thus during the year Satan’s instruments, filled with hatred and envy, were ‘‘lying in wait” to destroy the faithful, but, repeating the words of the prophet: ‘Jehovah is with us to help us and to fight our battles. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am very glad to be able to report that the witness work has not decreased. This is evidenced alone by the fact that the dear pioneers, although less in number, have worked 8,953 hours more and have distributed the same number of books as last year, 93,244. If the output of booklets by them was a little less than last year, they have, on the other hand, distributed 80,000 more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> copies and have gained 667 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further evidence that the company workers have also given a faithful witness is the fact that they have spent 20,000 hours more in the service than last year The quota for bound books was not quite reached, but the quota for booklets was exceeded by 152,500 copies; and 220,671 more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> copies than last year were put out The distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">GA</span><span class="font4"> copies exceeded the quota by 139,000 copies. The company woikers gained 3,169 more subscribers than last year. Particularly since Thanksgiving Week the number of company workers has increased considerably</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Herewith the sum total of what was accomplished by the companies and the pioneers in the Central European field We have 2,446 regular company workers, 184 pioneers, and 44 auxiliary pioneers. These worked 591,096 hours, distributed 151,447 books, 1,740,826 booklets, 531,344 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">GA</span><span class="font4"> copies, 4,192 Bibles, and obtained 5,041 subscriptions. This means that, with 65 pioneers less than last year, 29,000 hours more were spent in the service and the quota for Central Europe, which was 2,294,490, was exceeded by 129,127 pieces of literature. One million Declarations and 350,000 radio folders advertising the special lectures of Brother Rutherford were also distributed amongst the people. 2,423,617 books, booklets and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">GA</span><span class="font4"> copies were distributed, against 2,380,148 last year, excluding the special distribution in Italy of 300,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A comparative table including a diagram showing the progress of the work during the past three years in this territory is submitted with the report from the local manager, but it is not practical to insert the same in this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here I add a table showing the results in each country, accomplished by pioneels and by company workers respectively:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Recounting the greater difficulties during the year, we must acknowledge gratefully how nchly the Lord’s blessing has again been upon us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Comparing the work of the small number of pioneers with the work of the greater number of company workers, we find that the pioneers reached:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">50 percent of the total of hours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">62 &nbsp;&nbsp;” &nbsp;&nbsp;” &nbsp;” &nbsp;” &nbsp;” books,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">and 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">” ” &nbsp;” &nbsp;” GA</span><span class="font4"> copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was refreshing to watch how the pioneers not Speaking the language of the nation where they worked were not deterred thereby, but overcame all hindrances and inconveniences in order to give the witness even in the far out-of-the-way places. The pioneers in France compassed every island of the Mediterranean sea belonging to France. In Holland no islet of the North sea was overlooked. In Belgium no hamlet, and in Austria and the Italian Tyrol no mountain hut, was passed by, and in Switzerland even the exclusive and shut-off residences of the rich were visited. Also the dear pioneers in Yugoslavia overcame the long, wearisome stretches of bad roads in order to give the witness there in a greater measure than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With ever-increasing enthusiasm and with more workers participating the service weeks were observed. The facts show during the four great service weeks alone</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">21.9 percent of the total of hours, or 129,951 hours, were reached;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">15 2 percent of the total of books, or 23,156 books, 25.8 percent of the total of booklets, or 450,429 booklets, 13.6 percent of the total of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> copies, or 65,785 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Age</span><span class="font4"> copies, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">22 7 percent of the total of hterature, or 539,370 pieces of literature, were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While writing this report I received information that the two largest broadcasting stations in France, Poste Pansien and Radio Pans, have offered to broadcast the truth; also the strong station at Luxemburg. Thus, while the opposition in some quarters grows stronger, the Lord always provides ways and means to carry forward the proclamation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dunng the year mail received totaled 17,355; and dispatched, 14,613.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society maintains at the Bern office presses and other machines for the printing and manufacture of books and other literature. From the report of the manager of that factory the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of increased production it became necessary to make </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">few changes in the factory building, whereby more space is provided for the shipping department. This is now being done according to Brother Rutherford’s personal instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dunng this fiscal year our factory manufactured, for the countnes under the junsdiction of this office and for Northern European countries, in 16 languages:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Total</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Peri- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books Booklets odicals miscellaneous 1932-1933 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;114,591 2,437,208 719,525 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,139,996</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart from the above, tariff-duty barriers forced us to have books, booklets and penodicals to the number of 1,143,741 printed in Yugoslavia, Rumania, Poland and France, respectively, by worldly printing concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Outlook for the Coming Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the face of the increasing opposition threatening from different quarters, it is rather difficult to prophesy further success. However, we have the full assurance that the brethren everywhere are fully determined to challenge the Devil and his crowd, for the witnesses have foreheads of flint and they are going to do their utmost to increase the witness work, by His grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Particularly in France there is opportunity of increasing the service work, because there the radio is blazing the way for a greater distribution of the literature. Many letters from radio listeners and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> subscribers show how the Jonadab class appreciate the truth, which has come to them in this wonderful way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is also a better prospect for the work in Yugoslavia, as evidenced by the increased number of pioneers; and the same is true of Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gog and his whole army may continue to hunt our steps, that we may not walk upon our streets; they may hunt us in the mountains and he in wait to destroy us, but we know that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With us is [Jehovah] our God, to help us, and to fight our battles I ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Closing the report I will not forget to mention the wonderful blessing we all received from your visit with us, Brother Rutherford; particularly the brethren at the Bern office, at Pans and in Holland were greatly benefited by hearing and seeing your bold stand for the truth, and yet your meekness before the Lord and your full confidence in Him in the face of great difficulties. We are striving to follow your example, and we pray that the Lord may keep you and preserve you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We appreciate especially the recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles of Zechariah’s prophecy, and we look forward with joyful anticipation to the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font4"> It comes when we need it the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the name of the brethren of Central Europe, I send to you and to all the brethren in other lands joyful greetings. We are prepared for the final battle, and we are thrilled at the prospect of the near victory of the Lord over all his enemies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in China is getting a fairly good start from Shanghai During the year two pioneers from Australia spent some time in Shanghai and put out a large amount of literature. The largest radio station in Shanghai regularly broadcasts the transcription message, and a Chinese brother gives a Chinese lecture or translation thereof over the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year in China there have been distributed 1,602 books, 3,557 booklets, and booklets in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> form, 204; making a grand total of 5,363.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 1933 the work in Czechoslovakia has been carried on under great difficulties. The activities of the enemy in Germany and the closing down of the Society’s factory and office there likewise affected the work in Czechoslovakia, because the German factory produced and supplied the literature and helped in the work. Persecution also was carried on by the enemy in Czechoslovakia, and a number of pioneers were expelled from the country. Added to this the general economic conditions growing worse and the people growing poorer, the distribution of literature has been very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The population of Czechoslovakia is made up as follows: Bohemian, German, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Ukrainian and Rumanian. The work must be done in these various languages, and since many pioneers do not speak more than one language they have to do their witnessing by means of the testimony printed on a card in the respective languages. These cards are presented to the people when they are called upon, and this is the only means of testifying to many. Brethren have gone over into Czechoslovakia from Germany recently, however, and have organized the work in better condition, and there are now 94 pioneers in the service besides the company workers Regular service meetings are held and regional service conventions are also held in the different parts of the country and in the respective languages The organization method is translated into Czech, German, Hungarian, Slovak and Ukrainian, and work is conducted orderly in these languages. It has been necessary to do printing in that country, because it could not be done elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of all these hindrances to the pioneers and workers, the distribution of the Kingdom message although small is gratifying, and the number thereof put in the hands of the people during the year is as follows, to wit: books, 64,473, booklets, 240,498. Public meetings have been held, with an attendance of 14,600, at which a number of books and booklets have been placed. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription list has increased from 500 to 7,000. Within the country there are 42 companies organized for service. In addition to this, there are 62 sharpshooters and 94 pioneers now in the work. Jehovah’s witnesses there are earnest and zealous in trying to do with their might what their hands find to do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark are not great in number, but are strong in the spirit of the Lord and the power of His might. During the year they have shown a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house and with joy have performed the duties that the great Jehovah and his Chief Officer have assigned them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year bound books were placed to the number of 20,179, and booklets, 243,192.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Compared with the results achieved in the United States and the world over our figures may not seem big at all, to be sure; but then our part of the battlefield is only a small one, and email is the little valiant band of heroes fighting faithfully for the Lord’s honor and name. The Lord’s blessing has rested upon all our efforts, and our joy knows no bounds. Perfect harmony and unity of purpose prevail amongst the brethren here, all over the country. They are like prancing horses longing for the fray, and every time the word is given, ‘Out you go through the land 1 ’ they follow the call to action with eagerness and great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The biggest event of the year was, of course, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> campaign. Whenever possible we follow the lead of headquarters, also re the testimony periods and the ammunition to be used in these. This time, however, we had to move the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> campaign from spring to June-July, for although the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet was translated the very same day we got our copy and sent off to Bern the next day, it was not possible for Bern to get our edition ready in time for the spring campaign. But the Lord added his rich blessings to our efforts in the exceptionally warm summer campaign; so when the encouraging </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> arrived with the splendid international report, &quot;All Records Exceeded,’’ we could in publishing this report truthfully use the same heading also for the results here in Denmark. Our biggest result hitherto had been 102,348 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom; </span><span class="font4">now the result was 117,062 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the Lord is at the helm and that he himself is leading his organization on to victory is very evident. If it had not been for his abounding grace and protection, our work would have shown a decided decrease this year. We have had all kinds of obstacles and hindrances to fight against. Time and time again the Valuta Office which controls all the importation to Denmark has refused to let our books in. Especially has this been the case with the campaign booklets. Only after a very hard fight did we get the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> into the country and, then, quickly out to the people. And now three times the Valuta Office has turned us down and told us we are not going to get </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> for the big autumn fight, as we by far have exceeded our import quota for the year. We told the friends, however, to clear the decks and get ready for the big occasion, and all preparations were made At the same time we got in touch with one of the officials higher up in the Valuta Office, and at last, in fact in the very last moment, we got the Valuta people to alter their decisions, and the most wonderful little book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font4"> is now distributed to all the companies and today the biggest campaign in the history of the remnant is on, also here in Denmark, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s great name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attendance at the several service conventions held during the year has been steadily on the increase. The brethren are getting an ever keener appreciation of the importance of these gatherings of the Lord’s people, and a splendid work is done in connection therewith. Evidently the Lord is blessing this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had looked forward with the greatest expectation to a visit from you, dear Brother Rutherford, this summer, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">appreciate very much your intention of coming, if possible. Now we are putting the matter before the Lord, asking and hoping that he will open the way during the coming year and also give you the necessary physical strength for such a strenuous journey. Brother Salter’s visit as your personal representative was a mighty stimulus to us all, and it came in a very opportune time, j’ust as we were starting the big </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crists</span><span class="font4"> campaign. Four service conventions were arranged in connection with this visit, and it was indeed a line send-off.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is a small company of Jehovah’s witnesses at Alexandria, Egypt, and in addition thereto there is one pioneer working in Egypt. These together interest more people in the Kingdom message, and as they learn about Jehovah and his kingdom, they manifest a keen interest and tell others about it. The report states that in the Kingdom Proclamation Period every one of the consecrated in Egypt engaged in the work, placing in the hands of the people 522 books and booklets. The total output of books and booklets in Egypt during the year is, to wit, 2,720.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>ESTONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the small country of Estonia, on the Baltic sea, there are a few faithful and zealous witnesses, who take great joy in making known to others the message of the Kingdom. Amidst great difficulties and opposition during the year these faithful witnesses have placed in the hands of the people 44,224 books and booklets. The radio station at Tallinn, which regularly broadcasts the Kingdom message, has aided in this work. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The record of work done reveals an increase of 1,628 more pieces of literature spread than during last year. Tins increase, it is true, is not huge, but the work has been harder and economic conditions have been increasingly difficult. This is an agricultural country and large areas of it are marshlands unfit for cultivation. The people have food, but very httle money, and most farmers are unable to make expenses Another factor to be taken into account is the climate. During part of the Bummer we experienced a great heat wave, and it was with much discomfort and determination that many </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklets were put in the hands of the people in the capital city. Because of the beautiful summer, very many people were out of town during our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> campaign, thus necessitating greater efforts on the part of the workers to reach those ‘who have ears to hear’. Notwithstanding these conditions, eight pioneers went forth with joy and gladness and have spread 38,307 books and booklets, and an average of ten company workers and isolated brethren have placed 3,319. Often people purchase a booklet only, but later, having read it, they call or write to the office for more literature. There have been many such inquiries, enabhng us to place 316 books and booklets with interested ones. Some of these, who may be of the Jonadab class, have taken 142 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crists</span><span class="font4"> for distribution. The total literature spread during the year was 44,224 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By reason of the increased distribution it has been necessary to send out from the depot 2,638 books and 44,224 booklets, a total of 46,862, an increase of 3,576 pieces over last ycai's figure. A witness having been given in Tallinn, the chief city, with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet, the pioneers took large quantities of it and of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet with them for distribution in other towns. The reports to hand show that these two weapons aie very effective, and we hope to clear our stock of them in time for the new one, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society and its work are becoming better known as, m substance, the following extracts from an Estonian newspaper show: “The Watch Tower Society, winch was founded sixty years ago in America and in about 1923 came to Estonia, is known specially to radio listeners through the radio lectuies given on Sunday afternoons At present the Society is building in Tartu a vehicle similar to a house, and the purpose is to travel around the country in this and hold religious services They preach to the people out of the ‘chariot of the heavenly kingdom’ and distribute books that explain the Bible. The personnel of this ‘chariot’ consists of five persons, the chmf missionary, his wife, their child and two eneigctie young men</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The latter ride swiftly on bicycles [like Jehu] in all directions round about the ‘ chariot ’ distributing literature. ’ ’ A regional service director had this caravan built in order to more easily reach the rural districts untouched by railway or other communication. Wherever it has been situated, people have shown much interest in it and in the message it had for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In former years it has been our practice to hold regular meetings in the bigger towns only. As many such meetings were lately poorly attended, arrangements were made by three regional service directors to conduct meetings in country districts and villages. This scheme has had very good success, and as the result of 68 meetings, 11,599 persons had their first opportunity to hear the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the month of August a two-day convention was held, at which there were 30 friends present. At the two service campaigns arranged, 431 books and booklets were distributed. This gathering was made the occasion for holding the first meeting of the founders of the Society in Estonia, according to the provisions laid down in the act of registration of societies. The Society has now been properly registered, and we believe this will give us certain advantages in carrying on the work. An epitome of our belief and teachings was required by the Minister of the Interior in connection with the registration, and thus officialdom is informed as to our activities and the reasons therefor. A local newspaper took notice of our gathering, in words to the following effect: “The Bible Students Association had a convention on Saturday and Sunday. In the forenoon religious lectures were held, and after these all went out to distribute their booklets, called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘ Crists</span><span class="font4"> books’, that fight against ‘the cunning of Satan’s organization’.’’ Here is further evidence that many are beginning to realize what is going on in their midst, and we rejoice because of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thirty friends partook at the Memorial, 24 of whom took part in the service work arranged for that time. This is a very good proportion and reflects the fact that the average number of workers out each week increased from six during the previous year to twelve this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publication of the Kingdom message has been sent out every Sunday throughout the year by means of 200 radio lectures. Four different languages were employed in making these broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In submitting this brief report I beg to take the opportunity to assure you that the brethren here are united in love for Jehovah and his cause and rejoice to have some small part in showing forth his praises looking to the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Satan has greatly oppressed the people in Finland, and they continue to suffer, as the Lord foretold would be the case at the present tune. (Rev. 12:12) Of course, it is not expected that Satan’s messengers, the clergy, will give the people any comfort. Jehovah, the true God, however, sends forth. his messengers with words of consolation. During the year 545 company workers have been in the field, in addition to the pioneers, auxiliaries and others. During the year bound books and booklets to the number of 209,098. were distributed, and 238,617 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font5">magazine, besides free literature to the number of 275,665, which free literature was printed in the Society’s own plant at Helsingfors, Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following excerpts are taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that the financial condition, which the year before was already bad enough, has been still worse. The people have been month after month without work, and the small savings they have had have been spent long ago. It is in many cases almost a miracle how they can exist at all. But the difficult condition will work for good in the Lord’s hand It is apparent that the Devil has made a wrong calculation. Through his representatives, the clergy, he has tried to make Jehovah responsible for all these troubles, but as this teaching is in no way a consolation for those who are in distress, the people in difficulties are more and more compelled to search for consolation from other sources, and just then comes the fine opportunity to us to give to these hungry and weaned ones the blessed Kingdom message. That is the best explanation why the message is still going vietonously forward in our country, and great numbers of books are left in the hands of the people in spite of the very hard times and the great opposition from the side of the clergy and their allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Amidst all these difficulties the happy Jehovah’s witnesses have been nicely protected. We have felt the fury of the enemy, but he has only once succeeded in taking one of our sisters before the court, where she was sentenced to ten days in prison or pay a fine of a small amount. It was one of our pioneers, and she paid the fine, convinced that she could do more against the Devil’s organization outside the prison than inside ot it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special periods have, this year, as the years before, been of great importance, helping the brethren to take part with greater zeal than at any other time. Very often we heard the remarks: &quot;It seems that a very special blessing is resting upon the periods. It is easier than other times to give the testimony, and the people seem to be more willing to take the literature. ’ ’ During the special periods we have had the privilege to leave with the people 58,801 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Office Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great adversary has not been at all pleased with our efforts to proclaim the Kingdom message in this part of the world. He was especially angry after we got our new pnntery, and started to pull all the strings in order to kick us out, but the dear Lord has provided us a new home where we can freely do oui work. A special blessing has rested upon our efforts in this building entei prise After you kindly had given your permission for this building, the friends very freely gave contributions Even foreign brothers gave us good financial help. During the period of construction I had a very good opportunity to visit those who had something to do with the house, and I had the great joy of leading with the builders 192 bound books, 251 booklets, and 21 subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As our brethren are scattered over a very large area, tho gioups aie small and friends feel themselves lonely, so the work done by the regional service directors has been very important indeed. They not only have encouraged the friends by their words, but have regularly gone out doing a work which can fully be compared with the work done by pioneers in putting time in the field service and placing books in the hands of the people. The average for our file regional service directors has been over 2,000 books, which is more than twice as much as the average for our pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is still doing its good woik in stimulating brethren to honor Jehovah. We leceive lelteis in our office in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">which weary </span><span class="font4">friends tell how the encouraging articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> have given them new strength to go on in the fight. It is true that some few have left us and also ceased to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> but the others are pressing on putting more time in the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great help in the work has been the new books and booklets. The new books have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> 1 and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font4"> which latter was the first big book printed m our own printing plant. The new booklets have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lord’s Beturn, What Is Truth/ Hereafter,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The many service conventions we have had during the year have been special feast occasions, which have filled the triends with zeal when they have gone out to glorify the honorable name of our great Jehovah. In this connection I will with gratitude mention the good conventions we had during the very encouraging and highly appreciated visit of dear Brother Salter. The combined lesult of the conventions was 13,996 pieces of literature. During the year a good many public meetings have been arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The biggest work is still done by the companies, which highly appreciate the encouraging influence of visiting regional service directors and office brothers. As you see from the combined report, we have had 545 company workers, of which 281 as an average have been out, and they have spread together 125,451 books. If we add to that amount the work done by pioneers, auxiliaries and others, we get the whole work done in Finland during the last year: 209,098 books and booklets, 238,617 copies of our magazines, and 275,665 copies of free literature, or 723,380 pieces of literature for the 700,000 families hving in our country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very good support in the service has been our little printing plant, in which the following work has been done<sup>-</sup> 196,600 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> 32,630 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">24,845 copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> 173,310 copies of folders with message, 2,000 copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font4"> and 205,820 copies of forms, posters, etc., or, together, 635,205 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we look back upon all the blessings we have received during the past year, we can only exclaim, How good the dear Lord has been to us and how glorious is the opportunity to serve Him who is the Highest! Blessed be His exalted name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outlook for next year is inspiring. We have a new house equipped with many modern means to facilitate the work We have also a nice stock of books, and a good hope for new books and booklets, which always help also the older ones to go better. So we are well furnished to start the new year, and with the Lord’s help we will try to make it the best we have ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let me also, in closing this report, express the gratitude of the fnends for all the blessings it has pleased our dear Lord to extend to us through you and your good assistant, Brother Dey. And if it is not possible for you to visit us, which visit we so eagerly long for, we would be very grateful if you could arrange, as you did tins year, to send some other brother to strengthen the cords of oneness winch mean so much m our efforts to fight the fight of faith and glorify the name of our dear heavenly Father.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">While there are 40,000,000 persons in France, not a great portion of these give much heed to anything pertaining to religion or the study of the Bible. The black record made by the Catholics in that country over a long period of misrule has caused many good and honest people to hold aloof from anything pertaining to the Bible. This prejudice is gradually being broken down with reference to the truth, and now many are hearing it. The radio has been one of the great means used by the Lord during the year to get the truth to the people and open the way for the pioneers to carry them the message in printed form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention of Jehovah’s witnesses held in Paris in 1931 served as a great stimulus to push forward the witness work throughout the country. Thereafter many brethren went from other countries into France to engage in the pioneer service. The city of Paris has been covered three different times now by the pioneers, with increased success. The message now goes out over six broadcasting stations in France, and even other stations now are offering to take on these programs. The greater number of Jehovah’s witnesses are not native Frenchmen; most of them are from Poland, while others are from other parts of Europe These workers include Alsatians, Poles, English and others During the year there was a total of 1,032 workers engaged in the service 199,803 hours, and they placed 63,681 books and 651,357 booklets and 164,561 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age, </span><span class="font5">in addition to taking a large number of subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report from the Paris office the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The living conditions are also getting worse in France. Many brethren, miners, work only part time in their occupation. Their wages are small. Formerly a number of them could buy motorcycles to be used in the service, but now on account of economic conditions they are obliged to sell their motorcycles and therefore the service can be carried forward only under great difficulties. Nevertheless there is a good spirit amongst the brethren, and it may be said that all stand joyfully ready to do their best. During the Thanksgiving Week their enthusiasm reached the highest point, and the greatest number of woikers took part in the service. It may be mentioned here that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet, which was distributed in France during Thanksgiving Week, has awakened more interest than any other booklet heretofore published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we are glad to report the effect which the 422 radio lectures which were given during the year have had Of these 376 were broadcast in French, and 46 in English From all sections of France thousands of letters were received, which contained orders for literature or subscriptions for the French </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and in which great appreciation and gratitude for the truth received was expressed. But the radio waves also reached other countries, and responses were received from England, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Luxemburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford’s radio lectures during his European visit had a telling effect and brought forth a loud echo It appears that the clergy was aroused more than ever A Catholic member of the committee of one of the large stations at Paris sought to prevent the broadcasting of Brother Rutherford’s lectures, and the permission to broadcast the French translation was withdrawn in one instance. This station received hundreds of letters of protest, and now the manager has invited the Society to broadcast the truth again. The many letters received express the appreciation for the radio lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The strong and impressive radio lectures, whereby the truth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">proclaimed to the French people, are calling forth the Jona-dab class, and it is thrilling to notice how quickly such radio listeners become readers of our literature, and, reahzing the commandment of the hour, they stand ready to participate in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In October last year we were privileged to begin with the edition of the French </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> We began with some trepidation as to the result, but the Lord has shown us that the French </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> shall continue to be a useful instrument </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">making the truth known to the French people. We commenced with an edition of 16,000 copies and have kept up this circulation. Eighty percent of the regular subscribers have renewed their subscriptions for another year. The companies and pioneers are working hard to prepare the way for the other literature by distributing the French </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When great numbers of churchgoers, now hearing the truth by means of the radio, turn away from the church system; when six radio stations tell the French people week after week that the clergy have deceived them; when 70 diligent pioneers are visiting the French people day by day and give witness to Jehovah’s purpose, and when many hundreds of busy company workers are doing the same thing every Saturday and every Sunday, is it to be wondered at that the clergy in France see a great “danger” in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and are organizing an opposition against it </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font4"> The clergy are filled with rage and write and talk and act against us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Pans a certain number of Polish clergymen held a conference, and they agreed upon a resolution to do everything to turn the Poles who are associated with the Watch Tower Society away from that cause. Whoever would not hear them would be in danger of being expelled from France. From three towns we received word that the clergy had caused the htera-ture to be burnt in public in fiont of the chuieh doors. In other places the clergy posted bills and signs upon the church doors and schoolhouses to wain against the purchase of the literature of the Tour de Garde The clergy in France aie responsible for the difficulties which in some places the pohce are causing us. During the year ve had a recoid of 63 airests, but even the police officers themselves are beginning to see in many cases that our work is helping the people and dehvers them out of their spiritual darkness, and therefore they begin to despise the sinister actions of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the beg</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inn</span><span class="font4">ing of the service year the Creation Drama pictures were exhibited in several larger cities of Alsace-Lorraine. Particularly the exhibition at Strasbourg called forth the ire of the enemy. So many Catholics turned out to hear the message that the exhibition had to be repeated, and still each night many had to be turned away for lack of space. A battle in the press was waged, Catholic papers writing against more liberal newspapers. Some wrote in favor of the truth, and one paper stated courageously that the clergy shall not bring back the time of the inquisition during the Dark Ages One evening during the performance a tumult arose. The police were called and had to arrest a large number of the Catholic -disturbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, one priest went from house to house with the result that some burned the literature they had received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This opposition renders the work more difficult; but the faithful are strengthened through the food the Lord has provided. They clearly recognize the enemy and are determined to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font4"> forward with wisdom and courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the threats and obstacles have not discouraged the pioneers, or the diligent company workers, or us at the branch office. We recognize clearly what a mighty work of proclamation is yet to be done amidst the proud people of France. Our daily prayer is that the Lord may grant us wisdom, strength and joy to be fully awake to our responsibility and to perform faithfully our task. Our hearts rejoice at the thought of the imminent great victory of the truth, which the Lord may grant us to see!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 56 public lectures were held, with 21,710 attendants, 357 company gatherings, with 8,629 attendants, 8 regional service conventions, with 3,280 attendants Two regional service directors were employed dunng the year, and 15 brethren from Paris and Strasbourg respectively were sent out to serve the companies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For more than a quarter of a century the Society has carried forward its work in the land of Germany. During the World War little or no activity was possible, to be sure; and after the war the Society had practically nothing in Germany. Shortly after the World War there was a large amount of money sent by American citizens through the home office in Brooklyn to Germany for the purpose of investing in real estate and in machinery to carry on the work of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom in that land. Thereafter and until the year 1933 there was a constant increase in the progress of the work. Thousands of people gave testimony to having received much joy and consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the spring of 1933 political conditions underwent a great change in Germany. The opinion is here ventured that the harshness of the Versailles Treaty drove many good, honest people of Germany to desperation and they were ready and willing to grasp almost any kind of movement to free themselves from the burdens that the treaty placed upon them. There was a complete change in the administration in 1933, and Satan with his earthly agents, particularly from Rome, took advantage of the opportunity to do injury to the Lord’s cause. We know, of course, that Jehovah could have prevented this, but manifestly he has not interfered, permitting those who are opposing him and his kingdom to fully and completely identify themselves on the side of Satan before Armageddon takes place. Bavaria is a Catholic country in particular. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses began vigorously in Bavaria and within a few hours thereafter Catholic newspapers in the United States published statements gloating over the fact that the “Bible students” in Bavaria were being stopped. This is a circumstance showing that the order came from Rome and that the Papal hierarchy is really back of the persecution of God’s people in Germany. It has been easy for Gog, Satan’s chief officer, to pull together his religious agents and endeavor to induce the political wing of the government to work against the proclamation of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in April, 1933, the police of Germany, under order, occupied the Society’s property at Magdeburg and forbade the operation of the plant, closed it up and sealed the machines, and a search began of all of its books, literature and correspondence. Every room in the premises was thoroughly searched, with the announced purpose of finding some evidence that the Society is against the state. A whole staff of officials was called in to do this work, and after a thorough and complete examination of everything on the premises absolutely nothing was found, and the property and its activities were released on the 28th day of April, 1933. Enemies have charged that the Society was engaged in communistic activities and working in league with the communists and socialists to overthrow the government; but not one word of testimony was found in support of that. The government official making examination, after it was completed, remarked that nothing political nor any criminal evidence has been found by the searchers against the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On June 28, 1933, again the Society’s property was seized and occupied and its printing plant closed by order of the government. This was done upon an order which states that it is “a decree of the government for the protection of the people and the state, issued for the defence against violent actions on the part of the communists which actions endanger the state”. Not one word of testimony in truth and fact has been found to support this claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, incorporated under the laws of the United States, was legally admitted to Germany by proper legal authority in the year 1921. After being thus legally admitted as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">corporation a large sum of money was spent in erecting buildings, machinery, etc. The Society has always respected the laws of the German government and has never done anything that might be interpreted as being contrary to the same. The Society has never had any affiliation directly or indirectly with communists or any other political body. All of its literature shows positively that it is against such. The Society</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’s </span><span class="font5">work is devoted exclusively to teaching the Scriptures, and not at any time to anything political.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A treaty exists between the United States and German governments, which treaty guarantees to American citizens the right to have and maintain property in Germany and to carry forward their work in harmony with German laws The action of the German government has been directly in violation of this treaty. The State Department has acted together with the Society to have these violations removed. From June, 1933, to the first part of October the Society’s property at Magdeburg was in possession of the state police and the machines were sealed, and most of the 180 workers there were compelled to leave the premises. During that time the government police seized and carried away and burned over $25,000 worth of literature, books, booklets, paintings, Bibles and other material of the Society. The government has forbidden any meetings of the various companies of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout Germany, seized and confiscated all the literature and completely stopped the distribution of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In June, the president of the Society visited Germany to take some action to get the Society’s property restored to our possession and to carry on the work further. Knowing that the enemy has misrepresented</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the facts to the government, a Declaration of Facts was prepared, and on the 25th day of June, 1933, more than 7,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses assembled at Berlin and unanimously adopted the resolution, millions of which were printed and distributed throughout Germany. That resolution is as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Declaration of Facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;This company of German people, who are peaceable and law-abiding citizens representing many others from every part of Germany, all of whom are earnestly laboring for the highest welfare of the people of this land, being now duly assembled at Berlin this 25th day of June, A D. 1933, do joyfully declare our complete devotion to Jehovah, the Almighty God, and to his kingdom under Christ Jesus, whose shed blood bought the human race. We declare that the holy Scriptures set forth in the Bible constitute the Word of Jehovah God given to men for their guidance in righteousness, and that the Word of God is the truth, and that it is of greatest importance that man have a knowledge of his relationship to God. We ask to be judged by the standard of the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ Jesus is Jehovah God’s great Witness to the truth, and as his faithful and devoted followers we are, by His grace, witnesses to the truth. The purpose of this Declaration is that we may present a true and faithful witness before the rulers and the people as to the name and purpose of Jehovah God and our relation thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We are wrongfully charged before the ruling powers of this government and before the people of this nation; and in order that the name of Jehovah God may be exalted in the minds of the people, and that his benevolent purposes be better understood and our position fairly placed before the government, we do respectfully ask the rulers of the nation and the people to give a fair and impartial consideration to the statement of facts here made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ The Scriptures plainly state that the chief opposer of Jehovah God and the greatest enemy of mankind is Satan the Devil, whose name is also that of Serpent and Dragon. It is written in the Scriptures that Satan, who has long been the invisible ruler of this world, deceives and blinds the people to the truth in order that the light of and concerning Jehovah God and Christ Jesus may not shine into the minds of men. (2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4) Frequently by fraud, subtility and deception Satan has induced honest persons to war with each other, in order that he might turn them all away from God and destroy them. Above all things, the people need to know Jehovah God and his gracious provision for their general welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By the term ‘clergy’, as used in our literature, reference is made to that class of professed religious teachers, priests and Jesuits who employ improper political means to accomplish their ends and join forces even with those who deny God and the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the same class to whom Jesus referred as his persecutors. We have no criticism of any honest religious teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When Jesus went to the Jews to tell them of the truth, it was the Jewish clergy, that is to say, the Pharisees and priests, that violently opposed him and persecuted him and caused him to be charged with all manner of crimes and offenses. They refused to hear the truth, and addressing them Jesus said: ‘Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in hnn. When he speakeih a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.’ (John 8 43-45) Although the Pharisees and priests then claimed to represent Jehovah God Jesus told them that they were in fact the representatives of Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We have no fight with any persons or religious teachers, but we must call attention to the fact that it is generally those who claim to represent God and Christ Jesus who are in fact our persecutors and who misrepresent us before the governments and nations. As true followers of Christ Jesus we are to expect such opposition, and we mention it here in explanation of why we have been misrepresented before the rulers of this nation. To his faithful followers Jesus said: ‘Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they [the false religious teachers] have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.’ (John 15:20) Furthermore, Jesus said that this same class of men would cause his true followers to be wrongfully charged before the ruling powers, his language being: ‘But take heed to yourselves: for they [false religious teachers] shall deliver you up to councils [police power]; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten, and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.’ (Mark 13:9) This explains why Jehovah God now permits his faithful witnesses to be misrepresented and persecuted, namely, that those of a wrong spirit may identify themselves as opponents of God and thus bear witness against themselves. The same materialistic spirit that caused the persecution of Jesus Christ now exists and is back of the persecution of us as his faithful followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is falsely charged by our enemies that we have received financial support for our work from the Jews. Nothing is farther from the truth. Up to this hour there never has been the slightest bit of money contributed to our work by Jews. We are the faithful followers of Christ Jesus and believe upon Him as the Savior of the world, whereas the Jews entirely reject Jesus Christ and emphatically deny that he is the Savior of the world sent of God for man’s good. This of itself should be sufficient proof to show that we receive no support from Jews and that therefore the charges against us are maliciously false and could proceed only from Satan, our great enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The greatest and the most oppressive empire on earth is the Anglo-American empire. By that is meant the British Empire, of which the United States of America forms a part. It has been the commercial Jews of the British-American empire that have built up and carried on Big Business as a means of exploiting and oppressing the peoples of many nations. This fact particularly applies to the cities of London and New York, the stronghold of Big Business. This fact is so manifest in America that there is a proverb concerning the city of New York which says: ‘The Jews own it, the Irish Catholics rule it, and the Americans pay the bills.’ We have no fight with any of these persons mentioned, but, as the witnesses for Jehovah and in obedience to his commandment set forth in the Scriptures, we are compelled to call attention to the truth concerning the same in order that the people may be enlightened concerning God and his purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is said that our books and like literature, when circulated amongst the people, constitute a danger to the peace and safety of the nation. We are certain that this conclusion is due to the fact that our books and other literature have not been carefully examined by the rulers and hence are not properly understood. We respectfully call attention to the fact that these books and other literature were written originally in America and the language therein used has been adapted to the American style of plainness of speech and, when translated into the German, the same appears to be harsh. We admit that the same truths might be stated in a less blunt and more pleasing phrase, and yet the language of these books follows closely the language of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It should be borne in mind that in the British Empire and in America the common people have suffered and are now suffering greatly because of the misrule of Big Business and conscienceless politicians, which misrule has been and is supported by political religionists, and hence the writers of our books or literature have endeavored to employ plain language to convey to the people the proper thought or understanding. The language used, however, is not as strong or emphatic as that used by Jesus Christ in denouncing the oppressors and false teachers of his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The present government of Germany has declared emphatically against Big Business oppressors and in opposition to the wrongful religious influence in the political affairs of the nation. Such is exactly our position; and we further state in our literature the reason for the existence of oppressive Big Business and the wrongful political religious influence, because the Holy Scriptures plainly declare that these oppressive instruments proceed from the Devil, and that the complete relief therefrom is God’s kingdom under Christ. It is therefore impossible for our literature or our work to in any wise be a danger or a menace to the peace and safety of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our organization is not political in any sense. We only insist on teaching the Word of Jehovah God to the people, and that without hindrance. We do not object to or try to hinder anyone’s teaching or believing what he desires, but we only ask the freedom to believe and teach what we conceive the Bible to teach, and then let the people decide which they wish to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To know Jehovah God and his gracious provision for humankind is of most vital importance to all persons, because God has declared in His Word that where there is no vision or understanding of his Word the people perish. (Proverbs 29:18) We have devoted our lives and our material substance to the work of enabling the people to gain a vision or understanding of God’s Word, and therefore it is impossible for our literature and our work to be a menace to the peace and safety of the nation. Instead of being against the principles advocated by the government of Germany, we stand squarely for such principles, and point out that Jehovah God through Christ Jesus will bring about the full realization of these principles and will give to the people peace and prosperity and the greatest desire of every honest heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our organization seeks neither money nor members, but we are a company or organized body of Christian people engaged solely in the benevolent work of teaching the Word of God to the people at the least possible cost to them. Our organization was originally incorporated in the United States of America in 1884 under the name of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp;&nbsp;TRACT SOCIETY, and in 1914 incorporated under the laws of Great Britain by the name of the INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION. These are merely the corporate names of our organization for legally carrying forward its work. The Scriptural name by which we are known is ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’. We are engaged solely in a benevolent work. The purpose of our organization is to aid the people to understand the Bible, which discloses the only possible way for the complete relief and blessing for mankind. Our organization has extended its work throughout the earth. The education, culture and upbuilding of the people must and will come through the agency of God’s kingdom concerning which we teach as set forth in the Bible. The salvation of the people depends upon the true knowledge of and obedience to Jehovah God and his righteous ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The people are in great distress and in need of help to understand the reason for their unhappy condition and what is the means of relief. The Scriptures, when understood, make this matter clear. Instead of collecting money from the people and using the same to erect great buildings and to support men in luxury, we print the gospel message of God’s kingdom and carry it to the homes of the people that they may, at the least inconvenience to themselves, gain a knowledge of God’s purposes concerning them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A careful examination of our books and literature will disclose the fact that the very high ideals held and promulgated by the present national government are set forth in and endorsed and strongly emphasized in our publications, and show that Jehovah God will see to it that these high ideals in due time will be attained by all persons who love righteousness and who obey the Most High. Instead, therefore, of our literature and our work’s being a menace to the principles of the present government we are the strongest supporters of such high ideals. For this reason Satan, the enemy of all men who desire righteousness, has sought to misrepresent our work and prevent us from carrying it on in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For many years our organization has put forth an unselfish and persistent effort to do good to the people. Our American brethren have greatly assisted in the work in Germany, and with money freely contributed, and that at a time when all Germany was in dire distress. Now because it appears that Germany may soon be free from oppression and that the people may be lifted up, Satan, the great enemy, puts forth his endeavors to destroy that benevolent work in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">League of Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The language in our books or literature concerning the League of Nations has been seized upon as a reason for prohibiting our work and the distribution of our books. Let us remind the government and the people of Germany that it was the League of Nations compact that laid upon the shoulders of the German people the great unjust and unbearable burdens. That League of Nations compact was not brought forth by the friends of Germany. In America at one time the public press announced that 140,000 clergymen had set aside a certain period of time in which a concerted movement was to be made, and which was made, to induce the American people to fully endorse the League of Nations. It was the Federation of Churches in America that issued a manifesto stating that the ‘League of Nations is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth and which by them was substituted in the place and stead of God’s kingdom under Christ. It was in America that our organization under the visible leadership of its president pointed out emphatically that the League of Nations is not an institution of Jehovah God, because it is oppressive and unfair and nothing that proceeds from Jehovah God could be oppressive and unfair. It was that condition, existing at the time, which called forth the language that appears in our books concerning the League of Nations and also calling attention to the fact that such League of Nations compact can never bring about the relief and blessing of the people, because such relief and blessing can come only by adhering strictly to the principles laid down in God’s Word and in the manner which Jehovah has pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For almost half a century our strictly Christian organization has carried on its work in various parts of the earth. Its books are published in more than 50 languages, and upward of 140 million of these books are in the hands of the people. For more than thirty years our books and literature have been distributed throughout Germany, and millions of these are now in the hands of the German people and are read by the people, all of whom will bear testimony to the fact that these books, based strictly on the Bible, are of great help to them and upbuild them and give them hope for a realization of the blessings which Jehovah God long ago promised. In all these years of our work, and in the wide distribution of our books and literature, not one instance can be truthfully cited wherein our work or literature has been a menace to the government or has in any wise endangered the peace and safety of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The endeavors of our organization being exclusively confined to bearing testimony to the name and Word of Jehovah God, it would be entirely inconsistent for us to attempt to exert any political influence in the governments of this world or to do anything that would endanger the peace and safety of the nation. We have no desire nor inclination to do anything except to carry out our divinely given commission to proclaim the Word of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In America, Canada and other parts of the British Empire the political clergy, priests and Jesuits have persistently persecuted and continue to persecute those of our organization, and that without just cause or excuse; and we have every reason to believe that a like influence has been subtilly employed by the great enemy Satan to misrepresent us and our work in Germany. We remind you that in the years past the political clergymen have brought more sorrow upon the German people than probably any other class of men. We have no desire to fight with the clergymen, but we do ask that the ruling powers of the nation judge us not by the misrepresentation of such men, but that we be judged according to the Word of God and the work we are doing consistent therewith. Jehovah God persecutes no one, but permits each one to choose his own course, holding him responsible for his acts according to knowledge. Jehovah God has emphatically expressed his anger against those who do persecute others who are trying to serve him; and this proves that those who persecute us do not represent God, but that they are incited so to do by the enemy of God and man. —Psalm 72:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Great Truths</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Holy Scriptures, viewed in the light of present-day events which are in fulfilment of divine prophecy, disclose that: The time has arrived when Jehovah will make his name known to all creation and vindicate his name and clear it from the defamation which Satan has placed against that holy name. (Psalm 83:18) When Jesus Christ, the Vindicator, ascended into heaven Jehovah commanded him to wait until his due time to put the enemy down. That period of waiting has now come to an end and God has sent forth his beloved Son to oust the enemy and rule in righteousness. (Psalm 110:1-4; Hebrews 10:12,13) The world, or uninterrupted rule, of Satan has ended, and this began to be evidenced by the World War in 1914, and since then until now is the time when the gospel of the Kingdom must be told to the people. (Matthew 24: 3,14) Satan has now been cast out of heaven and down to the earth and now confines his operations to the earth in an endeavor to blind the people to the truth and to destroy them, and that is the reason for the present-day sufferings of humanity. The prophetic words of Jesus now apply: ‘Woe to the inhabiters [the rulers] of the earth, and of the sea [the people in general] ! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. ’—Revelation 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ The people of Germany have suffered great misery since 1914 and have been the victims of much injustice practiced upon them by others. The Nationalists have declared themselves against all such unrighteousness and announced that ‘Our relationship to God is high and holy’. Since our organization fully endorses these righteous principles and is engaged solely in carrying forth the work of enlightening the people concerning the Word of Jehovah God, Satan by subtilty endeavors to set the government against our work and destroy it because we magnify the importance of knowing and serving God. Instead of our organization’s being a menace to the peace and safety of the government, it is the one organization standing for the peace and safety of this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We beg to remind all that the great crisis is upon the world because the transition period from bad to good is at hand, and the hope of the world is God’s kingdom under Christ, for which Jesus taught his followers to constantly pray: ‘Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The power of Jehovah God is supreme and there is no power that can successfully resist him. His time to exercise his power in the interest of humanity and to the vindication of his great name is here. In this connection we respectfully call attention to the admonition and warning of Jehovah God, both to the rulers and to the people, which applies to this very hour, wherein he says: ‘Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion ... Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings, be instructed, ye judges of the earth Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed arc all they that put their trust in him ’—Psalm 2: 6,10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The present government having declared adherence to the aforementioned high ideals, we are persuaded that the rulers do not desire to knowingly resist the progressive witness work to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom which we are now carrying forward. If our work is merely that of men, it will fall of its own weight. If it is of Jehovah God and being carried forward in obedience to his commandment, then to resist it means to fight against God.—Acts 5:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We therefore appeal to the high sense of justice of the government and nation and respectfully ask that the order of prohibition against our work and our literature be set aside, and that opportunity be given us to have a fair hearing before we are judged. We respectfully ask that the government appoint a committee of impartial men to hold conference with a committee of our organization and that a fair and impartial examination of our literature and our work be made, to the end that all misunderstanding may be removed and that we may be mutually helpful to each other and that we may without hindrance obey Jehovah God’s commandment now applying to us, to wit: ‘Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones, lift up a standard for the people. ’—Isaiah 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ The peoples of Germany are a God-fearing people and should not be deprived of an opportunity to learn of Jehovah God and of his gracious provision to bring lasting peace, prosperity, liberty and everlasting life on earth to all those who know and obey him. Let all who love God work together to the honor and vindication of his name. All who take a contrary course must take the responsibility before God; but as for us, we will serve Jehovah forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Resolved,</span><span class="font5"> That copies of this Declaration be respectfully delivered to the high officials of the government and that the same be given wide publication to the people, that the name of Jehovah may be further known. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since then negotiations have been in progress between the Society’s representative, the Department of State at Washington, and the Gorman Government in Berlin. The result is that early in October this year the German Government entered an order for the release of all of the Society’s property and turned it back into possession of our representatives; but the order forbidding the activities of the Society is still in force, and this is a violation of the treaty between the two governments regarding religious liberty, and negotiations are still in progress to get these restrictions removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the brethren throughout Germany have been arrested and thrown into concentration camps, and they have been in great difficulties We are certain, however, that the Lord has permitted this for a purpose, and Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are not discouraged. They well know that they are engaged in the work of Jehovah and whatsoever is his will will come to pass. Whether the work is done in Germany or not we are not able to say. We will wait on the Lord, watch for his leadings, and act accordingly- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The zeal and earnestness of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout Germany during the time that they were permitted to engage actively in the work has shown a marked increase, and the results show that they did a splendid service. This report for Germany embraces about six months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reports received at the Magdeburg office up to the time that the work was suspended, the mail seized and all work stopped, show the distribution of books and booklets in Germany as follows: bound books, 490,333, and booklets, 4,661,583. Over the same period of time this was a decided increase over last year. During that brief period of witnessing testimonies were given to the number of 10,735,571, as against 13,788,796 for the whole year 1932. The number of persons receiving literature during 1933 was 4,596,111, which was almost equal to what was done during the entire year of 1932. More people, theiefore, proportionately, were reached during 1933 than in any year, and today more people in Germany have some knowledge of God’s kingdom than at any other time. There has been a great increase of demand for a knowledge of God’s kingdom, and this, of course, has angered Gog and his chief, Satan, and the persecution has been carried forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special witness periods have been responded to loyally and faithfully by the workers in Germany. During the Thanksgiving period of the remnant there were 19,268 workers in the field, which is more than at any time previous. It is interesting here to note that from 1919, when the work was revived in Germany after the World War, until the latter part of April, 1933, books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in Germany aggregated 48,000,000. In addition to this, 77,000,000 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font5">magazine were placed in the hands of the people. There being only approximately 15,000,000 families in Germany, that means an average of 3 books or booklets and more than 5 copies of the periodicals to every family and in the hands of the people. In addition to this there has been a large distribution of free literature. It can be well said that Germany has received a witness more thoroughly probably than any other country under the sun. The last witness period observed in Germany was that of the Thanksgiving period from April 8 to 17. During that time books and booklets were placed as follows: books, 11,647, booklets, 2,259,983, obtainers, 1,921,341, and testimonies given to the number of 2,312,726.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the first part of the year a number of public addresses were delivered, at which the people showed great interest. Many new study classes were started; and now the government has prevented these. During the period of activity of the year 1933, 410,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> were sent out, of each issue, making a total number of 6,880,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early part of the year a number of service conventions were held, but the last convention that was held was on June 25, in Berlin, as above stated. The Declaration adopted at that convention was printed and mailed to every high officer of the government from the president down to the members of the council. 2,500,000 copies were freely distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is learned now that the “evil servant” class has been cooperating with other parts of the enemy to injure Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany. The common people in Germany are hungry for the truth, and whenever the Lord sees well to open the door again there will doubtless be a much greater number receiving the Kingdom message with joy than ever before. The true and faithful ones throughout Germany are trusting wholly in the Lord and looking for the happy day of complete deliverance, when all shall have an opportunity to know Jehovah, from the least to the greatest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to the time of the seizing of our factory and the closing of it, the factory had produced during the year books to the number of 1,406,200, and booklets, 4,900,280, magazines, 8,000,000, and other literature, 13,346,000 pieces. The Declaration itself has been a tremendous witness to the people of Germany that they might know the true and Almighty God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s work in Greece is directed from Athens, and carried on during the year under great difficulties. The clergy put forth their strongest efforts to prevent the message of the Kingdom from going out. They do this, of course, under the direction of their father and his chief operator, Gog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bound books distributed during the year aggregate 1,974; the booklets, 151,223.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ab</span><span class="font4"> to the work in Greece: With grateful heart to the Lord I state that, notwithstanding the difficulties existing here, the Lord has blessed the work of witnessing to his name Though we have liberty on the part of the government, still the enemy does his best to stop the woik and terrorize the witnesses ot Jehovah. Many who were in the ranks of the witnesses last year are no more with us, but are turned against the work. Also, some of the courts have sentenced to fiom six months to two years and two months on the accusation of proselyting. Their case is pending in the court of appeal. L<sup>T</sup>ntil now the woik is going on under the blessing of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy time and again have tried to the best of their ability to have the government stop the work, but without success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to replace the radio, absent in Greece, we print the discourses of Brother Rutherford in tract foim and give them to the people free at the visits from house to house when the people do not want to take literature. The Lord has blessed this work, because even those who are prejudiced against our work are willing to take a free tract, at a second visit they are ready to take booklets or books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that owing to the crisis and distress of the people, especially in the country districts, the output of bound books and booklets is decreased, but the output of booklets in magazine form is somewhat inci eased The Lord also blesses the magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> in Greek, which is issued since last May. The people begin to be intei ested in it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year there are six pioneers in the field, who work in territories where companies cannot reach. All the witnesses of Jehovah are zealous and appreciate the great privilege bestowed upon them and try to go on, no matter what the enemy may do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our earnest prayer to the Lord is to open to us the way to giie a more complete witness to the name of Jehovah, that his purposes may be known to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>HOLLAND (Netherlands)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s office at Holland submits a very interesting report for the year 1933. It was the privilege of the president of the Society to visit this office in June, and also to have a meeting with the brethren at The Hague and to use the Hilversum radio station by invitation. This is the most powerful radio station in Holland; and it was the privilege of the president of the Society ten years ago to open that station with the first address broadcast from the public hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been found advantageous to establish pioneer homes in different parts of Holland for the pioneers who are engaged in the service, because the brethren then can live more economically and accomplish the work more successfully. Eighty-eight company, pioneer and auxiliary workers engaged in the service during the year. The company workers placed in the hands of the people bound books, 988; booklets, 26,408; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazines, 521; and the pioneersand auxiliaries, 10,043 books, 138,951 booklets and 1,194 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> This makes a total number, exclusive of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> placed during the year, to wit, books, 11,031; booklets, 165,359; which is a decided increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are glad that </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font4"> much was accomplished, which could not have been done without pioneer homes. We could not have kept as many workers in the field; and thus less books and booklets would have been put into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have obtained the results only through the larger number of pioneers Having a pioneer home as a base, the pioneers can stay better in the service, even when there are but meager results. The enemy is filled with wrath, particularly against the work of the faithful pioneer army, and he tries everj thing possible to hinder this work. This is especially true m tho section of Noord-Diabant, where the Devil has tried to hinder the work of Jehovah’s witnesses by using the clergy to influence the mayor and through the mayor the stiong-arm squad to oppose Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the 24th of June Brother Rutherford personally gave a lecture over the radio station at Hilversum, which was well advertised It was a remarkable success; over 3,000 persons wrote for the lecture in printed form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Golden Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Encouraged by the great success of Brother Rutherford’s radio lectuie, we suggested to issue </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> m Hol-landish. Our wish was fulfilled by the organization, and we hope to add to the subscription list during the year and to make this a useful instrument in proclaiming the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much energy was put forth during the service weeks, and results were accordingly. The campaign with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet was the most extraordinary that Holland ever experienced The stock of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklets was quickly exhausted, and the workers hope that of the special booklets, such as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font4"> greater editions will be printed, for the experience shows that it is easy to work with these booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The general interest in the truth has increased much. Daily many orders for literature are received at the office from people who show increasing interest in the truth. The daily correspondence has increased considerably, and we must work hard to meet all the requirements. However, this encourages us, and we rejoice in these grand opportunities in the service ot the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work of giving testimony to the Kingdom in the country of Hungary during 1933 has been carried on under many difficulties, but the ardor and zeal of the witnesses have not been dampened, nor have they been beaten down. During the fiscal year there have been placed in the hands of the people books to the number of 5,383, and booklets, 7,425. The work is not permitted officially, and there is much interruption from police officials. Many friends are arrested and imprisoned and their books confiscated, but in spite of all this the little company there are pressing on and doing their best. The brethren are confidently trusting in the Lord and carrying forward the work with full determination to be faithful and maintain their integrity toward him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the big country of Iceland one pioneer works. The Lord gives him courage and comfort, and he pushes on with no visible companion. The work there is directed particularly through the Denmark office, whence the literature is sent to him. During the year there have been placed in Iceland bound books, 926; booklets, 2,639. Just now the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font5"> booklet has been printed in Icelandic, and already 4,000 copies are forwarded, but no report on the distribution of these had been received at the time of this report.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the early Christians went into India, and now, at the close of the period for giving the witness before the destruction of Satan’s organization, the Lord has been pleased to send other witnesses into that benighted country. While these witnesses are few in number, they are zealous and earnest and are putting forth an endeavor to give a testimony to the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there have been placed in the hands of the people bound books to the number of 13,475, and booklets, 55,385.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the manager of India the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work of announcing to the peoples of India the purposes of Jehovah and the hope of the Kingdom has continued to progress throughout another year, bringing an ever-increasing appreciation and joy to those who have taken the matter seriously and put forth an earnest endeavor to give a faithful witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is still only a mere handful of workers; but the results, measured by the total number of testimonies given and literature distributed, show a marked increase over any previous year. The number of pioneers remains about the same, but there has been a healthy increase in activity amongst the company workers, and that phase of work is now carried on systematically.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It must be borne in mind that 90 percent of our workers are Indians. Indian habits and methods are very different from ours of the West. The Indian is a great talker and it is very difficult sometimes for him to ‘get a move on’. This applies both to the people being witnessed to and the witnesses. The above figures show that the company workers as a whole (of whom 90 percent are Indian) put in more hours than the pioneers, but did not gne ncarlv so many testimonies But these Indian brethren are lull of enthusiasm and aie wholeheartedly devoted to the Lord and his service. The total number of testimonies reported during the previous year was 74,674, which, compared with 120,283 for this year, will show something of the increased activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Amongst the English workers the most notable progress has been made in Burma. A year ago there were only two or three who took the matter seriously enough to engage in regular service. Now there are fifteen regular workers, two of whom have recently enrolled as auxiliaries. An English pioneer went over to Burma in January and has organized and encouraged the brethren there, so that now there is quite a hum of activity from Rangoon to Mandalay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no doubt that the special campaigns are the finest means for publicity that we have. The friends everywhere have responded well to the call for the extra effort required during these periods. The Crists campaign was a great success. We doubled our previous best effort and had 270 workers in the field. Some thought that this booklet was all right for America but unsuitable for India; but reports show that Indians away in the country towns have acclaimed it as “just the message we want’’. Up in the Punjab the Urdu edition of it has caused a great stir, for the missionaries in that province are mostly Americans. They were enraged and came out with all sorts of abuse in their vernacular press. This, of course, gives us greater publicity, and there is no doubt that ultimately it must lead to a further separation of the ‘ ‘ sheep ’ ’ from the “goats’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The task of giving a really efficient witness to the Indian ‘Christians’ is perhaps the most difficult one we have to solve. In the state of Travancore there was an average of 81 workers in the field each month, and this state has had a very thorough witness. In the Punjab also the message has met with a good response and there is regular activity, but in the remainder of this vast field there are no Indians to work amongst their fellow men. The work is being done, however, by English pioneers, but they are naturally handicapped by reason of the language difficulty. One pioneer has traveled alone during the whole year in a house-car equipped with cinema outfit, by which he has shown the “Drama of Creation’’ to thousands of ‘Christians’ and in this way probably done more than any other single worker to make known the hope of the Kingdom amongst the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new booklets have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> great boon. The work of translating them into the vernacular has been pushed forward as rapidly as the means at our disposal would allow. Except for Malayalam and Urdu we have no Indian brethren capable of translation, and this means considerable delay and difficulty in getting other translations made. Non-Chnstians usually make a poor job of this work, and educated Christians capable of doing it are usually in the employ or under the influence of the missionaries and afraid of identifying themselves with us in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> has been published in Gujerati and Tamil, with a reprint in Malayalam. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font4"> was produced in Malayalam and Urdu, and the Burmese edition is now on the press. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Who Is God?</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hereafter</span><span class="font4"> have been printed in Urdu, whilst </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> is now ready in Malayalam and Urdu, and the Tamil and Burmese translations are being made. A total of 46,000 vernacular booklets have been printed, and a further 7,000 are being published. This necessitates a considerable expenditure of money, for which there is little received in return, but the Lord has provided sufficient to keep the available workers busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reference to the Directory of Foreign Missions shows that the message of the Kingdom has now been ‘preached’ in some form or other in every district where missionary activity is carried on. In the majority of districts a really thorough witness has been given by means of the “Drama of Creation’’ and the printed page, and where it has not been possible to send a pioneer the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet has been posted to the ones in charge of the mission stations. A few of these have replied, but the majority have turned a deaf ear to the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our little band of ^ight English pioneers are scattered far and wide. One is in Burma; one has concentrated his activities on the business firms and served notice upon “conimeicial-ism ’ ’ in some of the principal cities of India and Ceylon. Three are woiking in two house-cars, and others are engaged in general pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have received our first transcription machine, and a pioneer is now on tour with it, but it is too early as yet to report on this additional means of publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many incidents about which I could write, but space foi bids. It is perhaps worthy of note that the worldwide depression has had its effect upon the activities of “Christendom’s” false shepherds In one district at least, the missionaries are so hard pressed for funds that they have stopped all pay to their Indian preachers and give the wives of the married men Rs 7/- ($2.00) per month for the care of children. Their husbands, having no other means of livelihood and disinclined to go out preaching on an empty stomach, sit at home and do nothing, with the lesult that the more intelligent of their flocks are more easily convinced that these men are really parasites, feeding upon others and having little interest in the people’s welfare and certainly no real love or devotion to God. The honest-hearted among them are thus more ready to listen to the hope of the Kingdom. When the Lord really spoils their pasture these men will have no way to flee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, I wish to place on record our sense of gratitude for the blessings which the Lord has showered upon us through his Word made plain from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> It is a great stimulus to see the unfolding of prophecy; and on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses in India, Burma and Ceylon, I express gratitude to the Giver of all good gifts for his love toward us in permitting us to serve him throughout another year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Jamaica is carried forward by a little band of faithful witnesses of Jehovah. Almost all of these are colored brethren. During the year they have placed in the hands of the people bound books, 9,726, and booklets, 34,773.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is extracted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the island was visited by three disasters, a hurricane, a prolonged drought, and a severe rain storm, each of which had very great effect on the work; hence our placements have not been as large as those of the preceding year. The effect of the disasters has been so keenly felt that many of the pioneers had to leave the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of everything that would retard the work, the witness work progresses and the number of the interested ones is increasing daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the use of a sound truck supplied with a talking machine and a loud-speaker extensive witnessing work was car-tied out by the local manager with the assistance of the regional directors and the companies. The sound truck, which is now being used by the local branch, is supplying a long-telt necessity, aa the people are delighted in listening to the lectures, which can be heard distinctly half a mile away In a large race track near the center of the city, we are having two weeks of lectures closing the old year and opening the new year As a result of these lectures the local manager has been invited to deliver four of these lectures at an exhibition in Jamaica, at which thousands of persons are expected to attend.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there has been a great persecution of our few faithful brethren in Japan. Of course, the Devil and his chief representative, Gog, have been instigators of this conspiracy, and the carrying out of the overt acts by their chief visible instruments in this persecution has been by the clergy of the denominational church systems, particularly those who pretend to be missionaries of the Lord. The persecution resulted in the seizure of all the Society’s publications, the prohibition to distribute any of the literature, and the confiscation of books, which were carried away from the storehouse and burned in the presence of the people. The pioneers in the field were ordered to stop work, and many of them were arrested, and practically all the workers thrown into prison, where they were held for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Korea also is conducted from Japan, and this report embraces both countries. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will surely be glad to know that Japanese and Korean brethren kept their faithfulness and integrity toward Jehovah and his Anointed King even during the severe testings Only one pioneer and several others who were not active in the service were drawn from the field, and five (three men and two women) jumped into the service as the regular pioneers. These five newcomers have been studying the truth for many months, but when they saw such big reports concerning the arrests and raids of Jehovah’s witnesses in every public newspaper they threw everything aside and rushed into the very front lines. Now I am happy to send this particular report to you</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I left Tokyo for the trip on May 10 last. I received a cable from the Tokyo office when I was at Port Arthur, on May 14. I learned that something happened during my absence. The next day I got a letter by air mail at Mukden of Manchuria, from which I learned that all the office staff of our branch (five brethren) were arrested and thrown into prison and the work in the branch was kept going by sisters. Two days later I knew more particulars, when I received two letters from Sister Akashi. The situation seemed very critical Almost every newspaper of May 16 and 17 gave almost a whole page to report concerning arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses at many places in all Japan. I decided to go back to Tokyo immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Returning to Tokyo I expected to be arrested on the ferry boat between Pusan and Shimonoseki, because I learned in the newspaper report that the police were very busy searching for “Junzo Akashi’’, agent for the “horrible Jewish Secret Society, Watch Tower’’. I returned to Tokyo safely under the Lord’s guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as I returned to Tokyo I made the first report to you, on May 21. The next day I appeared before the chief of the higher police. I was in jail for four days. During the time I was examined by the chief four times. As the answer to his questions I made a good, strong witness to the holy name of Jehovah, his Anointed King and his kingdom. My answer was written in statement form. I learned later that this written answer is printed m book form and a copy sent to the chiefs of police all over Japan and also to the most higher circle of Japan. Now they know what the Kingdom means to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The police raided the Society’s offices at Tokyo and Seoul. They seized the whole stock of our publications and Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> of last three years. The warehouse at Tokyo became quite empty. The police also seized books and booklets possessed by pioneers and other brethren all over Japan and Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as I was released from jail I sent a questionnaire to each brother and sister to ask, Who will remain faithful to the Lord </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font4"> (Ex. 32: 26) All pioneers, except one woman, answered the Society that they shall remain faithful to the Lord with gladness. Later two women and three men jumped into the service at this trial moment. Now we have seventy pioneers in Japan and seven pioneers in Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two pioneer brethren were in Manchukuo since last March and were very active among Japanese residents there. On June 10 they were ordered to quit that country by the order of the chief of the Japanese army there. All stock of the Society’s publications was seized and burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These brethren came to Seoul, Korea, to work with Korean brethren, but a week later they were ordered to quit Korea by the order of Japanese governor general of Korea. The Society’s office at Seoul was raided and searched by the police. All of the Society’s publications were confiscated everywhere in Korea and were burned. Now Korean brethren are giving the witness there with the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the L)ecd<sup>f</sup></span><span class="font4"> in Korean and Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> I expect to make a visit there early m October to reestablish the work there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Devil Got Mad</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Devil and his marshal Gog are very mad at the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses here. Just before arrests were made a tremendous number of books and booklets were placed by the brethren in the people’s hands. “Tanks” were splendidly active. For instance, I show the record for the month of April:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is published according to the newspaper law of Japan. We put up one thousand yens as the deposit money. Now this is the only one organ that we can use for the witness work here in Japan. Of course, the Devil does not like this publication. But the Lord permits us to use this publication until his due time. Each issue (once a month) of it carries a good long article on the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. Since all books and booklets were seized Jehovah 's witnesses are working with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> They place more and more in the people’s hands. For instance, as a result of the five-day period (September 6 to 10 inclusive) 9,425 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font4"> were placed and 453 yearly subscriptions obtained by €6 pioneers and 4 auxiliaries.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese “Watchtower&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brethren here in Japan and Korea are very well supplied with the latest light through this publication Every main article that appears in the English </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is faithfully translated into Japanese and appears in the Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> This is published according to the newspaper law, and we put up one thousand yen as deposit money.

<p><span class="font4">Since the “tanks” began their activity in the field last October only one year has passed. The Devil does not like this. We are ordered to stop the use of all tanks in the field. Now the brethren are active by the bicycles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Homes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some pioneers have many children It is far less expensive to live together. Now we have two pioneer homes in Tokyo, one in Osaka and one in Kyoto. The result is splendid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Police Officers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many police ofiicers who attended the case of Jehovah’s witnesses showed such a good feeling towards the brethren. One military police officer who investigated a case told one pioneer, “I know the government is wrong. I have no more interest in my position now. I wish to quit my job and help Jehovah’s people ’’ One chief of police of a city said “When I am not in the uniform of the chief I agiee with jour sajnngs fullj<sup>-</sup>.” One policeman of a village said “I haie ncier met a more pleasant people than your Jehovah’s people ” One detective said: “My, this is the most wonderful thing I ever heard. Of course, I cannot believe what you ha.e told me right now, but I can tell you that I shall neier forget all through my life,’’ etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dear Brother Rutherford, of course we cannot tell what will happen the next moment Howeier, we are under full protection of Almighty Jehovah and his Anointed King We are so happy to know the meaning of the name of Jehoiah lie will do everything for us. The only piaj'er of the faithful ones here is to be faithful until the utmost end and His name to be glorified We, under the Lord’s dnection, push the battle to the enemy’s gate</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amidst all tins persecution prior to the destruction of the stock of books on hand, the faithful workers in Japan placed in the hands of the people bound books to the number of 30,456, and booklets, 101,692. In addition to this there were placed in Korea books, 4,105, booklets, 26,208.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Satan’s agents in Latvia have been exceedingly busy, as in other places on earth, and have put forth a desperate effort to prevent the testimony work of Jehovah’s witnesses from being performed. In the face of all this opposition in that small and benighted country, during the year 20,428 books and booklets have been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year just closed has been an eventful one m connection with the woik in Latvia The year began well, the increased activity which marked the last few months of the previous year in no way abated, and dunng the first quarter there was an increase in the quantity of literature placed of more than 93 percent, compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. This activity was evidently not pleasing to Gog, for towards the end of January he caused an effort to be made to stop the work entirely in Latvia and, in fact, it was stopped for four and a half months. But thanks be to God, who always leads us forth to triumph in the Anointed, the work was restarted in the middle of June; and although we had only one booklet at first (now increased to three), the monthly average spread during the last quarter was greater than that of the first quarter of the year and the number of full-time workers in the field was also larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our difficulties here, as elsewhere, are directly traceable to the opposition of the clergy. On February 10, following an “inspned” article in the Kiga newspapers of the previous day, a search of the office of the Society was made by members of the political police. About ten or a dozen men were engaged in the search, which lasted for seven hours, and at the conclusion they removed all the Society’s books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font4"> correspondence, hectograph apparatus, typewriter, money, etc. Similar raids were afterwards made at the homes of some six Latvian brethren in different parts of the country, and all books and papers found were removed into the custody of the police. Notwithstanding all this display of force and the removal of so many of the Society’s documents and books the political police have found no evidence on which to formulate any charge, and they now have little interest in us. Some of the members of the political police, after reading some of our publications, expressed surprise that there should be any difficulty encountered in importing and spreading the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The events related in the foregoing paragraph took place about the time some brethren from the German, office were here in an effort to have the Society registered. The search and consequent excitement caused by newspaper accounts were responsible for some delay, but eventually a Latvian Society was legistered, and now we have three booklets printed in the country, and a fourth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font4"> will be ready very soon. With regard to books printed in Latvia, the Minister’s powers are not quite so autocratic as with imported books; his actions can be contested in the courts, with whom the final decision rests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stoppage of the work for more than four months has naturally had an effect upon the total output for the year; but the activity of the brethren, both before and since the interruption, has been such that the number distributed is only 20 percent short of the total for the preceding year, the actual number placed being 20,428. During those four months it was necessary for the pioneers to find other situations, and the joy they have in being once again in the Kingdom service is clearly seen in the letters written since. One such letter reads: “I am very happy to write to you now, I am again in the Lord’s work. It is a great privilege and real joy to be again in the Kingdom service, after so long a time of waiting. I am only very sorry I did not begin to work immediately the first booklet came out, but I was in a very bad condition of mind and fearful that it would not be possible to make so much that I could hve. But, now that I am again going from door to door telling what is right, all the fear and trouble is away and I feel again as one of the remnant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four service conventions were held during the year, with a total attendance of 125. Three have been held since the work was resumed and have proved a means of help and encouragement to the friends. They were held at different places in the country to serve better the convenience of the friends who are not able to make the journey to Riga on account of the expense. The number of books placed during the conventions was 650.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Lithuania Baal’s agents have put on the garments and thoroughly identified themselves ready for the conclusion. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses has been severe in that country during the year, but in the face of all this 23,899 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people. In addition thereto a number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> have been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses will read with interest and appreciation the following extracts from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the first six months the work progressed favorably and we were well over our quota. Then came the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, with 13 workers in the field instead of the customary half dozen, while m Memelgebiet 58 reported for service, to compare with the average of 15. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font4"> in Lithuanian had just arrived, and the prospect was indeed encouraging. Then the forces of Gog became active and confiscated a number of books. As the possibility of other books’ sharing the same fate was realized, an extra effort was made the following day with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet; but that evening the three British workers were arrested and kept for eighteen hours in a filthy, unfurnished cell. They were refused permission to communicate with the British consul, and every effort was made to get them quickly and quietly over the border, where action for redress would have been difficult. At the last moment the consul got to hear of the matter and, through his intervention, an extension of time was obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No charge whatever was preferred, although the newspaper reported that the arrests were made owing to the spreading of “pure communistic” literature. When the matter was brought before a meeting of several ministers of the government, however, the only complaint made was that the books were badly translated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Visas and permits to reside in Lithuania were ultimately restored; but the enemies of the truth have taken advantage of the opportunity afforded to ban a number of the books and to withhold the permits necessary for us, as foreigners, to work in this country. One native worker has been able to continue in the work to some extent, and we hope that others will soon be added to the ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart from the arrest of two workers for “disturbing the peace of the sabbath”, the work in Memelgebiet continues without interference. The disruption of the work in Germany, and the pro-Nazi attitude of so many of the people in Memel-gebiet, has hindered the work considerably. As the Nazi government in Germany has opposed the work, many of the Germans in this district feel that they must follow suit with the same cry of “communistic” and “pro-Jewish”. Nevertheless, the quota has been exceeded by nearly 25 percent, 17,652 books and booklets having been placed by an average of 17 workers, who gave 19,736 testimonies. The difficulties experienced have had the usual effect. The zealous have been spurred on to greater activity, while the lukewarm have grown cooler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A service gathering was held in the town of Memel, when 460 books and booklets were spread. The largest number attending a meeting was 90; but less than half this number took part in the convention in the real sense, by seeking to honor the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two court cases are pending m this district. In one instance an attempt is being made to withhold from us the right </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the ministers of the government admitted that the opposition to the work in what is known as “Greater Lithuania” was brought about at the instigation of Roman Catholic priests; but from later information it seems that pressure has been brought to bear from some higher representatives of the Roman Catholic “church” outside Lithuania, probably from Rome itself. It is quite possible, too, that the publication of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet helped to bring matters to a head. A copy of this booklet was sent to every clergyman whose address was obtainable. Some sent for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> which was specially advertised when the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets were sent; and it is interesting to note that the first batch of books banned as being “against the interests of the government” were those advertised in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets to the clergy and higher-ups was responsible for a young man’s making a journey of 170 miles to the office to inquire regarding the pioneer work. This young man was the hbranan, under the direction of the priest, of course, of a village library. On receipt of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, the priest passed it on to the librarian without reading a page. The young man read the whole booklet, however, and sent for further literature. It is hoped that it will be possible for him to engage in the work before long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although, owing to the above-mentioned opposition, woik in ‘•Greater Lithuania” has been possible during only six months of the year, the total number of books and booklets placed is 23,899, or only 6 percent below the year’s quota and 18 percent below the figures for last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is therefore much cause for gratitude to Jehovah for his blessing and protection. Now that the forces of Satan have been permitted greater activity, the protection and ministry of the “angels m Zion” in past years is more clearly realized. It is certain that, in such a priest-ndden country as Lithuania, the work would have been stopped long ago had that protection not been exercised on behalf of the witnesses of Jehovah. Truly “the name of Jehovah is a strong tower”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further encouragement is found in the realization of the fact that these very circumstances and conditions have been foretold in the prophecies drawn to our attention in the pages of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Even as Jehovah has promised, “before they spring forth I tell you of them.” Surely the time is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">near when the Greater Jehu will make an end of the enemies of Jehovah who are now so clearly identifying themselves.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As is well known, Luxemburg is strictly a Catholic country. The clergy exercise a strong influence and bitterly oppose the message of the Kingdom. It is nearly impossible for foreigners to do any work in the country, as most of these are expelled. Some pioneers have gotten in there, however, and stayed for a short time. Some new ones are found in the country who have devoted themselves to the Lord and are doing some work. During the fiscal year, bound books have been distributed in Luxemburg to the number of 706, booklets, 3,138; while testimonies to the number of 6,782 have been given, and 3,000 persons have obtained literature and 8,692 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font5">have been distributed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The country of Mexico is an exceedingly interesting place from many viewpoints. The early history of the Aztecs shows that they were a very intelligent people. The mixed people who are there now, the Spanish and those who are particularly Mexicans, all have been kept more or less in the darkness because of the influence of the Papal hierarchy. For a long period of time the Papal hierarchy extracted from Mexico approximately 30,000,000 Mexican dollars per year that went to Rome to help keep up the institution there. The people knew little or nothing about the truth. The revolutions, however, have opened the way for a better education to be given to the people, and some of them are now understanding God’s kingdom message. Early during the fiscal year the president of the Society made a trip to Mexico city and by invitation used five radio stations in giving broadcasts, which were well received by both the management and many people who expressed themselves through the mails and otherwise. A new location for the office was obtained during the year and the work was organized and put on a better working basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year just closed there have been 105 workers actively working in the field, composed of 41 pioneers, 11 auxiliaries and 53 company workers, and these have placed in the hands of the people literature to the amount of, books, 20,835, booklets, 32,609.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fiscal year 1933 has been a year of greater activities and better results than 1932, especially during the last six months, thanks to the Lord. This can be demonstrated by the fact that the output of literature of the last six months, April to September inclusive, was superior to the entire output the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A total of 46,024 hours was reported as worked, of which 19,845 were worked the first six months and 26,279 the last six months. During the entire year the workers left worked with greater zeal, giving more time. The total of testimomes given was 273,346. Comparing the number of workers of last year with those of this year, each worker this year did the work of three or more, for the number of testimonies was larger than last year, and the workers’ average was about one-third. Workers at their best this year, as per September’s figures, are, pioneers 41, auxiliaries 11, company workers 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Comparing the hours with the testimomes given and the results, we find that the workers are working slower, but the results have increased almost 200 percent; this can be proved by comparing last year’s report with this report. The total of persons obtaimng literature last year was 22,491. This year, 29,839. Of this last total, 19,824, or almost two-thirds, belongs to the last six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total literature placed this year was 53,444, or 21,220 more pieces than last year. Of the total, almost two-thirds was placed during the last six months of the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions and Radio; Several</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fiscal year registered the second general convention in Mexico, with the added feature that it was the first time Brother Rutherford visited the friends. Also, during this year the radio was used for the first time m Mexico for the proclamation of the truth The lectures were heard all over the country, and Brother Rutherford’s voice was heard plainly at Bethel. Nine stations were used, four of them in chain. Lectures were discontinued, but the Lord has now opened the way once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the Society has been at last duly registered; has nicer and more central headquarters and a more businesslike office. We are aiming to systematize things in such a way that it will be of mutual help for the workers and for the office, and though it is a haid task, all are responding, for, though unaccustomed, they are willing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Present Conditions; Prospects</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last month of the fiscal year was a rather hard month for Mexico in its entirety, but especially the zones where more friends lived or pioneers were at work. It may be necessary to mobilize some. Cyclones, floods, etc., caused lots of trouble to the people at large. However, the friends are not dismayed, and at this writing they are enthusiastically engaged in Kingdom Proclamation Period, and by the looks all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets sent to this branch will be in the hands of the people at the end of the period. It was rather difficult to get the booklets in time for the campaign, on account of custom houses’ being closed for ten days; but we are able to have the booklets in the hands of the friends, if not before, at the very beginning of the campaign. At some places nothing could be sent, for the roads were washed out or the district flooded. Strange enough, in this month we had the largest receipts had during the entire year (no booklets were paid for in advance). The pioneers and other workers at the affected zone were spared of injury or loss of life. Of course, some went through lots of trouble. Perhaps the results will be felt later on; but we hope to do all we can to offset these difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some difficulties that eould hinder the work are gradually vanishing away; the friends more and more see their privilege; we are better equipped to do the work; so, taking all these things into consideration, we are praying the Lord to add his blessing for the increase of the results while we go on heralding the message and find ourselves busily engaged in vindication work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To facilitate the Society’s work and that it may be done more efficiently, a central office is maintained for Northern Europe at Copenhagen, Denmark. The manager of that office has immediate jurisdiction over the countries of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. The brethren in that north land, like Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere on earth, have been pushing forward against great odds. This is exactly as we should expect it to be, because the Lord specifically told us that all who would continue faithful would suffer persecution at the hands of Satan’s representatives The faithful in the north land are not discouraged, but rather they have received much comfort from the Scriptures as unfolded to us by the Lord, and with patience are continuing steadfastly to do the work which the Lord God has given them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report made by the general manager of the Northern European office the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We spend our years as a tale that is told, singing forth the praises of Jehovah and pausing at intervals to enjoy the precious privilege of reporting the matter So we can measure the depth of the stream issuing from under the threshold of the temple and fulfil Ezekiel’s prophecy as opened up for us in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font4"> How strengthening it is to our faith!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The past year has been one of wars and alarms in every country of Northern Europe, for the Devil knows he has but a short time and makes the best of it. In Denmark, Gog would limit our activities, and this week the highest court will decide whether we are peddlers or ambassadors [Before going to press, we had the report that the court decided in our favor.] In Sweden </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">clergyman M. P. brought in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">bill against the “godless” (meaning Jehovah’s witnesses), but it was thrown out, and he was told if his religion needed so much protection it was not worth much. In Norway several cases against our pioneers are hanging fire. Long may they do so! &amp;&nbsp;Finland we were compelled to move our printery, and so had to build a house. In Estonia, when our Finnish and English pioneers retire sick, we are now unable to get others, for on account of the severe economic depression they are keeping out foreigners. In Latvia and Lithuania we have been charged as anarchists and communists and the work stopped entirely. We have begun again in Latvia and hope soon to overcome the difficulties in Lithuania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the enemy tries to discourage us, the effect is the exact opposite of what he intends, because this state of affairs was portrayed in the year’s calendar, which reminds us that “the name of Jehovah is a strong tower”. When our books were confiscated in Latvia and we were refused permission to import more we printed three booklets in Riga, and it was refreshing to see with what eagerness the pioneers, driven to take worldly jobs for four months, returned to the fray. The message was as a fire in their bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average number of brethren out each week was 1,086, as against 1,030 last year, so that bad times were met by having more soldiers in the field and working longer hours. We have still a large army of camp followers, and it is hoped their bones will soon catch fire. 1,853,292 testimonies were given, as against 1,652,025 last year, and there were sent from the offices 105,978 books and 1,014,294 booklets, of which 571,258 were </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis.</span><span class="font4"> The numbers placed were 103,814 books and 878,180 booklets, a grand total of 981,994. We are down 65,000 on last year, due to the fact that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet arrived a month late and m June hosts of people in Norway, Sweden and Finland, those lands of far distances, were scattered over the countrysides when our effort began. Last year 603,803 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> went out, but only 435,658 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> have gone so far, for we began with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> in March and with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> in June. Conditions are, of course, worse; but that is general all over the earth, and, generally speaking, they are good yet in Scandinavia. However, in the whole of Northern Europe only two countries show an increase: Estonia, where there is a small one achieved in difficult circumstances, and Denmark, where there is a good increase. There the organization method, after the removal of some hindrances, is coming into its own. Week in and week out the regional service directors have done good solid work and, the country being a very tiny one, the service conventions have encouraged every single soldier in the fight. No wonder the Devil seeks to prevent our work both on Sundays and week-nights unless the bishop approves our literature. Bishop, forsooth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we had 213 pioneers and auxiliaries out each week, on average, as against our previous highest of 185 last year. They spread 445,614, against 460,705; and but for the stoppage of our work in Latvia and Lithuania we should probably have shown no decrease at all, for it was not great in any country. Our best effort was in Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, when 1,641 brethren spread 104,689 pieces of literature, mostly Cnsw. Each of the world-wide periods was thoroughly enjoyed. The flood of light coming to us through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> from our glorious Leader is proving a wonderful stimulus to the brethren everywhere. It is a real joy to go out in the work and tell the people that neither Hitler, nor Mussolini, nor Eoosevelt, not to mention spineless individuals like MacDonald, can help them in the slightest degree, and that only the kingdom of Jehovah will provide the remedy for earth’s woes. The wonderful success of the World Economic Conference in drinking beer, tea and coffee and doing nothing else, somehow specially grips the imagination of the people and makes it easy to slip a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4"> book into their hands It is no wonder, Brother Eutherford, that the brethien everywhere are in splendid form. Then, too, in Scandinavia and Finland we have just got a composite </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font4"> which you named “Jehovah’s Testimony’’, and which will last us for four or five years, as our small editions are expensive The brethren are delighted with it, and it will surely be a constant source of refreshment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Fleet</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last year our motor boat on the Norwegian coast spread about 7,000 pieces of literature, and additionally there are about seven more boats, owned privately by the brethren in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. A brother in Denmark has recently bought a 34-foot motor boat and is now living on it with his wife and child He hopes to visit many islands in the coming year with the Kingdom message. As an illustration of what can be done in some places not often touched, a young brother in a small boat off the Norwegian coast spread, in 213 working hours and 151 hours’ traveling, 225 bound books and 1,060 booklets, as well as taking a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">GA</span><span class="font4"> subscription and spreading 112 copies of that magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the little town of Skien, in Norway, with its 16,000 people, 67 took part in the memorial but 81 have been out in the work, proving there are some Jonadabs there. Forty of them were at Oslo service convention, and on their return 29 went to a near-by place in the following week and gave 1,000 testimonies and left 50 books and 659 booklets. Their bones were well alight. The English pioneers have done good work in Norway also and have reached many out-of-the-way places in a motor ear. In Estoma one of the English pioneers built himself a house-car, which was spoken of in a leading daily as ‘the chariot of the heavenly kingdom’. In Lithuania two English pioneers did good work until the ‘right’ to work there was withdrawn. However, before they went the English part of the Devil’s orgamzation at our request got after the Lithuanian part thereof, with the result that their foreign office and home office officials had to read through our books and make a report upon them. One man, whom I saw, said they contained “many interesting matters’’. So officialdom gets its witness, including Mr. Ramsay McDonald, Sir John Simon and Mr. Neville Chamberlain. I pitched into them, and at all events we have the right to stay in Lithuania, and hope soon to get busy again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We still send out the message in Russian, Estonian, Swedish and Finnish each week from Ta</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">llinn</span><span class="font4">. What the effect is in Russia we know not, but it is God’s Word and will surely prosper. So we continue strong in faith, but desirous that the flesh of the whore should be eaten soon so that the clergy should be cleared off the radio boards. I often pray, “Oh, that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Golden Age”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1930-1931 we had, roughly, 47,000 subscribers; in 19311932, 48,000; and now we have 52,000 aside from single copies; so we are encouraged, because this paper breaks down prejudice and keeps on pointing to the Kingdom. I would like to see our editions doubled and still some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And so on we go, doing with our might what our hands find to do, and praying the inspired words: “Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. And let the beauty of [Jehovah] our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon ns; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s valiant witnesses in Norway have put forth a vigorous effort during the year to fulfill their commission. In doing so, they have placed in the hands of the people books to the number of 18,442, and booklets, 126,264; making a total of 144,706.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following excerpts from the local manager’s report will be read with much interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are indeed a privileged people whom the Lord is feeding with ‘‘fat things full of marrow”. The articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> ‘Ruth-Naomi,’ ‘Spiritually Minded,’ ‘Moses’ and ‘Daniel’, have been wonderful and glorious. Book One of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> which we now have m our language, has strengthened and encouraged the friends to go harder against the Lord’s enemies. We are also especially thankful for ‘‘Jehovah’s Testimony ’ ’, the daily texts and comments. The friends have missed the daily texts up to date. They have until now had the old Manna texts. The new booklets we are gradually translating. They give us new exploding ammunition; and as the people very often are so poor, they can more easily afford a booklet and thereby take their stand for Jehovah and be marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The few active friends in Norway have also this year put forth great zeal and endurance m bringing the message of the Kingdom out. The economic pressure </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ib</span><span class="font4"> just as hard as last year. Satan’s agents are also as hateful as before, but the shadow of Jehovah’s mighty hand has protected us; so Satan doing his worst has not been permitted to harm us. Satan has tried to disturb and weaken some brethren; but till now he </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font4">not succeeded, and we know that they that are chosen, anointed, humble and faithful shall not be deceived. Our hearts are filled with thanks to the Lord not only for being permitted to believe in him, but also to have the privilege to suffer with him. We rejoice in being able to walk in the light with heart and intellect and stand whole-heartedly on the Lord’s side, loyally following the Lord’s leading by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have sent out, in all, 144,706 books and booklets, 4,900 Bulletins, 4,220 circulars and letters. There are 11 companies organized for service, and 157 friends have been participating in the work; average number each week, 84. Twenty pioneers and auxiliaries have been out. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> has 4,588 subscribers; 15,869 copies distributed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is still doing a good preparing work for the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our motor boat “Ester” has now only two brothers. The distances were so great and the people spread around, so it was difficult for three to manage. They are now going in the fjords around the islands along the coast with the thousand rocks. In the wintertime there are hard storms. The boat is now in good condition, equipped with electric light and radio with loud-speaker, which one of the brothers on the boat had made himself and given to ‘Ester’, before he knew that he was coming on board. It has been very useful and also </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">comfort for them in the long and dark winter nights. The weather reports by the radio have been of special use to them. The brothers are of good cheer. They say that 75 percent of the people are against the clergy. But the economic pressure is so hard; many of them can’t afford to contribute for the books. They have met many people who have never before heard of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the largest groups are often driving out to the nearest small towns and villages in buses and motor lorries. The enemies are terror-stricken by this swarm of “locusts”. Usually we have “Jehovah’s witnesses” in big red letters on the buses or lorries. It has been very effective. We appreciate being worthy to bear this wonderful name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">August 26-29 we had our yearly convention in Oslo. The highest attendance was 238. Of these, 120 friends went out and spread 3,173 books and booklets. Twenty-six were baptized. From Skien came forty friends in two open lorries. They drove 260 miles. When going home they drove the whole night and went direct to their places of work. From Bergen 27 fnends came in 2 buses and one car. They had to drive 960 miles over very difficult mountain roads and on ferry boats. Many have written that they went home very encouraged. This convention was in many ways the greatest we have had. Indeed, we are the happiest people now on the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Dominated by Catholic influence for many years, Poland has been kept in the dark, and now, when the Lord sends his messengers into the land with the light of truth concerning his kingdom, much opposition results. This opposition comes almost exclusively from the Catholic hierarchy. The people are becoming very poor, and it is difficult for them to provide the things necessary. The result has been, during the year, that, while the brethren have been zealous and earnest in their work, the distribution has not equaled that of 1932. The brethren have put in more hours and worked harder, and this is the result: books, 7,193; booklets, 110,236, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine, 160,651.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That others may see how many difficulties are encountered by Jehovah’s witnesses in this Catholic-ridden country, the following is quoted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The workers in the field have shown much more energy and zeal than before. The difficulties caused by Satan’s organization continue to grow, and we often wonder how the Lord overrules the conditions so that we can still continue the service. The clergy are wrathy, and it happens that clergymen even steal the correspondence addressed to the brethren. They get this mail at the post office and use it for their own purpose. One such ease we had to turn over to the court. It also happens frequently that priests incite the people to attack the friends in the streets, rob them of their literature and burn it publicly. One of such cases was turned over to the court and the priest condemned. Yet the Catholic Synod is trying to have the first verdict canceled. In one section it happened that workers suffered violence at the hands of such bands. They were left on the ground in an unconscious state and had to be carried away by fellow workers. In one place the friends, pursued by a frenzied crowd, took refuge in a castle The aristocratic resident of the castle called the police to deliver the friends. The police came with cars from eight different headquarters and drove away the sinister crowd. I had the opportunity to talk to brethren who were thus beaten upon the battlefield, the same as Paul was stoned, and I could convince myself that these brethren appreciate the suffering as a great privilege, and they continue to serve with even greater zeal, and this spurs others on to serve likewise courageously. The rage of the clergy appears to have reached the boiling point. They charge the brethren with selling without a license. We have had about 100 of such cases, but in most of them the brethren were acquitted. According to Brother Rutherford’s instruction, the brethren defend themselves in the courts, as is suggested in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font4"> The subject matter was given to the Polish friends in letters of instruction, and the court officials received a wonderful witness in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently the brethren were charged with spreading disquieting reports of evil when they speak of the Kingdom, but they were acquitted. When these attempts fail, they use another method of attack. They now try to prove that our books contain blasphemy. A brother in Komz was thus charged. He was about to commence with his work and talked to the family about the Kingdom without distributing anything as yet. The policeman, who had been in hiding, took him and arrested him. The books were taken from him and sent to the priest. The priest compiled six sheets with extracts, which were supposed to be sacrilegious. At the trial five priests from the vicinity appeared, and one chaplain as major. The latter would run during each intermission into the conference room of the judges to influence them and to convince them of the ‘danger threatemng the country’ through the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. He also feared that by this work public opinion is being divided and that that is ‘a danger to society in case of war against another nation ’. The judge was not convinced, and he asked the priest about the origin of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, which the witnesses of Jehovah reject. The clergyman had to admit that this doctrine is not contained in the Bible, but that it came from Babylon and was taken over as a fact by all civilized peoples. The doctrine of purgatory he tried to prove from the apocryphal writings, but the defense of the Catholic faith appeared rather ridiculous. A man came out of the court room occasionally and said to the crowd waiting outside: ‘ ‘ The priest is getting the worst of it ”; and another one remarked: ‘ ‘ Up there hell is being divided into lots.” Finally, because of the pressure brought to bear upon him, the judge announced the verdict of six months in prison for the brother, who was about to distribute alleged &quot;sacrilegious literature”. The district attorney, however, was not satisfied, because the punishment was not severe enough; and so the matter is coming up before a higher court, and here we have great hopes of having the brother acquitted, because he was doing that which all the witnesses of Jehovah are doing throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In our report last year we expressed the hope of having the confiscated literature released. It pertained particularly to literature which had been sent by brethren from America to private addresses in Poland. However, this caused the confiscation of most of the literature at Lodz and at Warsaw. This matter was now decided upon by the highest court at Warsaw and all the literature at Lodz and at Warsaw and at other places was given back to the brethren and all the doors of service were opened, which has encouraged the Lord’s people in this country very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another form of attack is this, that the priests and their accomplices distribute papers in which the Lord’s people are charged with communism This is a vicious attack of the enemy and renders the work more difficult in certain sections. However, the Lord knows how to protect his people Recently a Roman Catholic priest wrote a long article m a Catholic journal, in which he stated that there is a big difference between communists and Bible students and that it would be wrong to get the two mixed. He then drew attention to the citations in our literature, where it is stated that anarchy or communism will never make mankind happy. He also pointed out that there is a big difference between prophesying the threatening world catastrophe and causing it. It would be wrong to accuse the Bible students of causing the trouble. The priest had written this in an official paper and to defend Jehovah’s witnesses, and this called forth a controversy between the bishop and the archbishop and they called the priest to task for having expressed a different view from what the two bishops had approved of. The matter is not yet finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The distribution of literature in this year, however, has somewhat decreased. On account of the great crisis and poverty of the people it becomes more difficult to place a book. A number of pioneers were forced to leave the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is seen from this report that more hours were spent in the field and 50 percent more testimonies were given this year, but because of the crisis not so many books and booklets were distributed. At the same time more literature may have been distributed in reality, because it is rather difficult to get the Polish brethren to report regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding the coming year we have full confidence that the Lord will protect His work against all subtle attacks of Satan and his crowd and that we shall continue to give an even more thorough witness for the truth. Many of Satan’s most cruel attacks have been turned back We pray the Lord to help us in the future. There is one battle after the other, and we feel like being in the trenches all the time. We want to use the privileges which the Lord has given us in this land. A small but very courageous company of witnesses is raising the banner of the truth, even though the brethren here have not as yet received the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tear Boole</span><span class="font4"> and the newer publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in this country have participated in all the international service weeks. Now we have only two regional service directors, who have held 519 company meetings, with an attendance of 13,684 people, and also 172 public meetings, with 23,469 attendants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Portugal has never made much progress, due doubtless to the fact that the people have been kept in darkness there by the Papal hierarchy so long that it is difficult to get them interested in anything. Added to this, most people are quite poor. During the year there have been placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 3,860.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">After many long, hard and difficult fights and the destruction of much of the Society’s property in Rumania, the Society was, during the year, admitted as a corporation within that land. Then, at the instance of the enemy, the distribution of the literature was prohibited by a judgment in court. The case was appealed, and a higher court reversed the verdict and the Minister of the Press was forced to release the booklet for distribution. The clergy howled against this decision and forced the Minister of Cults to withdraw the permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year, however, 122 organized companies, in which there are 420 workers, engaged in the field service a total of 30,430 hours and placed in the hands of the people 1,190 books and 59,248 booklets. In addition to this, 212 Bibles and 339 New Testaments were placed. In spite of all the opposition the brethren continue to put forth their best endeavors to prove faithful to their commission as witnesses to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The spiritual famine is great in this land. In some places, inhabited by Russians, the people follow Jehovah’s witnesses in groups from house to house, in order that they might hear as much as possible of God’s kingdom. Those who read the books and booklets take all the literature published, when they are called upon a second time. The service report shows that the results of the second visit are better than of the first. Those in high positions have a great responsibility before God, and also the pnests who, with devilish instruments, seek to prevent the preaching of the Gospel. These godless men for a time even caused the distribution of Bibles to be forbidden, and Bibles were confiscated; but later this decision had to be canceled because of the intervention of a high statesman.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>SARRE BASIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Sarre Basin is another country directly under the supervision of the Central European ofiice for the conducting of the Lord’s witness work in that land. During the year 154 workers there spent 16,805 hours in the field and placed 4,480 books, 33,812 booklets, and 15,428 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service weeks served to encourage the brethren, and the result was accordingly. One company, during Thanksgiving Week, placed 52 percent more booklets than during the previous </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">half year, which proves that the Lord blesses the special ef</span><span class="font4">forts of such weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The exhibition of the revised Creation Drama pictures was very successful. They were shown in six towns and were attended by about 5,000 people, who listened with great interest to the proclamation of the Kingdom message. The clergy had warned against the attendance and had arranged other entertainments at the same time; but our halls were overcrowded and the doors had to be closed before the opening timfe. The attendance was so remarkable that we had to give the lectures in the afternoon and in the evening in one place; and 150 friends who had become interested in this way are continuing to come to the meetings. Some say they would like to be of the Jonadab class, and they participate regularly in the service from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is our experience that the people in territory often worked have made their decision for or against the truth. It follows that our territory can be worked now much more quickly because the people decide more quickly whether they accept the literature or not. The measure forbidding the work in Germany is a reason that many are now ready to occupy themselves with this matter, while others, on account of this measure and threats of the clergy, fear to take the literature The economic conditions are also growing worse, and that renders it more difficult to place the bound books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries Spain has been a benighted country by reason of the darkening influence of the Papal hierarchy. In more recent years the government has cast away the Papal hierarchy, and some of the good people of that nation are getting their eyes open. Occasionally a Catholic priest, honest of heart and mind, gets hold of the message of the Kingdom and accepts it. The work in Spain has progressed slowly but surely, and it is gratifying to report that the work during the past year is an increase over the previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this report year the distribution of literature has been 2,429 books and 40,574 booklets, making a total of 43,003, as against 12,713 during the previous year. The number of books is about the same; the increase has been in the booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is due in a great measure to the facilities which you granted us a little O', er a year ago, which enabled us to pi mt the booklets here. Since then we have printed 78,000 booklets of eight different titles on our little “Vertical Miehle”, all but 10,000 of these falling within this report year. In addition, we have, of course, published </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad</span><span class="font4"> every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This has been a heavy financial burden on the Society, especially as the Spaniards, with few exceptions, continue to be slow to rise to their privileges of service, so that the work has been done chiefly by five pioneers, only one of whom is a Spaniard. But these are all young, zealous and active brethren who “see visions”, and Jehovah’s blessing and protection oier them has been manifest all along</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The way the young Spanish pioneer came along clearly showed the Lord’s overruling He was a shepherd in a tiny village up in the hills, to which not even a road led. But even in that isolated spot the message had found its way in the shape of a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad,</span><span class="font4"> Number 1, which he found in a ditch. As a consequence, he ordered the books, and shortly after, when everybody turned against him and began to tell him lies about us and to attack the truth, he determined to come here and find out for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time in his life he left his native village and undertook a journey of over 400 miles for the sole purpose of coming to see us Being satisfied that this was the tiuth, he straightway offered himself unconditionally to serve the Lord in whatever capacity he might be used, and since then he has been faithfully engaged in vindication work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have received frequent inquiries as a result of the literature left with the people, and sometimes even from the cleigy. Just recently a former Catholic priest and missioner ordered all our books and subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad.</span><span class="font4"> He had read a few of our booklets, which he praised highly, and said that, being also a lawyer, school teacher and author and in spite of his own studies of the Bible, he had not been able to understand it until he had read our booklets. In vain had he sought the path of light, both in his own and in the Protestant churches, and which he now had begun to discern, thanks to our booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outlook for the future is hopeful, and by the Lord’s grace we hope to carry the witness into every part of the country into which we have not hitherto been able to get. The political situation is unsettled and a dictatorship does not seem to be very far away, although not imminent. The trouble is beginning to make itself felt in this country, and the people seem more receptive to the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude to Jehovah for the rich food which has been our portion during the past year and the way in which the truth is becoming clearer as time goes on.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Sweden there are 47 companies organized for service and which engage therein. There are 44 pioneers engaged in the service, and 21 auxiliaries. These have been working faithfully together during the fiscal year, and their record is 308,234 books and booklets placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is quoted from the report of the local manager :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking at the disturbed conditions prevailing in the world today and seeing how the enemy has been permitted m some countries to greatly hinder the lemnant, one must surely feel and express great gratitude toward Jehovah and his glonous </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font4"> for the privilege we have been enjoying in this country, in that we have had perfect freedom to walk about and proclaim “this gospel”. And even if the depressed conditions have made themselves felt here also, so that longer hours have been required in order to place the same amount of literature as formerly, and the placements of bound books have been a few less, yet we have evidence of some real interest being awakened in many. At the same time others have shown that they have taken their stand against the Lord, just as we should expect in this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the friends do appreciate the privilege of service is evident from the fact that we have had 60 more workers than last year, the total being 654, excluding pioneers. And including the pioneers we have had an average of 338 out in the work each week; which means 32 more than last year. They have worked, all of them, a total of 103,349 hours (direct woik, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">excluding time for </span><span class="font4">coming and going), as against 96,720 the previous year. The number of testimonies delivered was 546,764, which is 31,645 more than during 1931-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are now 47 companies organized for service. This is five less than last year, the reason being that some small companies have dropped out from this list and are now to be found under the sharpshooter arrangement. Company and sharpshooter friends together have placed a total of 147,865 books and booklets and, additionally, many subscriptions and single copies of the Swedish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of pioneers we have had three fewer this year, as some have had to leave this branch of the service on the grounds of ill health. But the average number of pioneers out each month has been one more. Among the auxiliaries we have had 3 more, and the average number out has been 4 more. These two divisions of the little army have placed, between them, a total of 141,966 books and booklets, besides a goodly number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions and single copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This last summer we have made a special effort to reach, through the pioneers, all remote corners of the country, and two brothers m possession of a motor boat have also been calling on the isolated people on islands, etc, along the coast They have had good success and met with many who never before heard anything of the message, especially among the fishermen and pilots in the archipelagoes above referred to To some of the lighthouses and other really isolated spots </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age is</span><span class="font4"> now going regularly, as well as books being left there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we have no access to the radio, we are still arranging public meetings according to the old fashion (no talking machines are available either), and 265 such meetings have been held this year, with a total attendance (of strangers) amounting to 20,250, which is an increase of 8,061 above last year’s attendance. There seems to be a tendency now among the public to go and listen to direct talks, more than for some years past. They seem to begin to get tired of constantly listening to the stuff they get over the radio. For this autumn and winter we have planned and asked all the friends to cooperate in an effort to get public meetings arranged in such places, little hamlets and villages in the country in the first hne, where there has not heretofore been delivered a discourse by Jehovah’s witnesses. These meetings, are often a good means of stirring up interest. One pioneer reports that he has often had to gather the population in the mountain villages to a meeting in the evening, when they are through with their jobs for the day, and talk to them all before he could place any literature. And after listening they have taken all they could get, in some cases all he had along, which made it necessary for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> to borrow back a booklet, which he afterwards used in taking orders for the books there advertised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have tried again to get in over the radio, but with no success. They told us in the Radio Corporation that they themselves had nothing against letting us in for an occasional lecture, if only we could persuade the church board in control of religious broadcasting to agree I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year, as previously, the little gatherings at conventions have been much appreciated by the ones benefiting from them. In this country, where traveling is rather expensive, it is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">great blessing to have small conventions at convenient points. There have been 28 such, as against 26 last year, attended by 1,261, which is 258 more than last year; and 176 more friends took part in the witnessing work during these conventions (874 against 698), and some 2,000 more pieces of literature were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the convention we were working with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Cnsis, </span><span class="font4">which had arrived from the printery two weeks before. It came in very handy in this respect, that we had just time to hand it in at the Riksdag (parliament) right before it closed down its sessions for the season. The last session was devoted to discussing and passing some bills re relief work because of the great financial cnsis, and that very day this booklet reached the members of the Houses. Out in the work a few days afterwards one brother met an M P. who stated they had all got it and that it had aroused quite a bit of interest. He thought the message sharp but thought-awakening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> work we have had much encouragement. The number of subscriptions has gone up by 2,917 to 22,179, and 17,878 more single copies have been spread. It is very encouraging to read the correspondence coming in to this jour</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nal </span><span class="font4">from readers all over the country, asking questions, etc.; and some, beginning to take part in the work, have had their first impulse to do so from answers to their questions in this journal. In one case two pioneer sisters experienced this: When starting their work in a factory village it was discovered by the people in one home that they came from the same Society that is editing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> And upon this information the youngsters of the house ran out and told all the families that they ought to get some of this literature, as the ladies </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were from The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the Bethel family join me in sending warmest love to you, dear Brother Butherford, and we want to thank you for all your faithful service, and ask Jehovah’s blessing and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be your portion continually that you may keep on in the noble fight and see the glorious triumph, where we all desire to be found among lus church of the firstborn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The territory of Switzerland is small. Although most of the ground is largely mountainous and hard to work, Jehovah’s witnesses frequently get over it. During the fiscal year the average number of workers in the field was 585. They put in 67,105 hours; an increase of 5,573 over last year. The output of literature during the year was, books, 26,374; booklets, 282,991; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazines, 122,863, and Bibles, 94. In addition thereto 1,000,000 copies of the Declaration were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last year we reported that the cantonal government of the Gnsons had forbidden the distribution of our literature in that canton. The chief governor had stated that he would ariest every one of our workers if we came. Knowing that the people there always were glad to receive the truth, we recently organized a surprise attack to come to their aid. In order to do our work quickly, only brethren with cars and a certain number of workers were invited. Shortly before the time of the attack, this move was made known. The organization and the cooperation worked wonderfully The brethren proved that they have learned to decide quickly and that they are always ready for action: 119 workers came, most of them in 20 cars, several by motorcycles and some by railway It was a wonderful day. There was no interference, and during three hours of service 2,450 booklets were distributed and also 4,000 Declarations, which Brother Butherford wrote while here in Europe The trip into the territory was extraordinary Theie are deep valleys and canyons dividing the mountains, but the difficult roads were overcome easily, and the people ot the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This office employed two regional service directors during the year, and Bent out 26 brethren to serve the companies. In our territory 49 public lectures were held, with 7,665 attendants; 398 company meetings, with 9,944 attendants, and 9 regional service conventions, with 1,920 attendants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is some interest in the Kingdom message in Syria. The Society has a small depot at Aleppo, and some work is carried on from there. Those who are interested are chiefly Armenians The literature placed during the year, books and booklets, aggregates 2,330.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Those interested in the Kingdom message in Trinidad, Port of Spam, are quite poor in this world’s goods. In fact, that is true almost everywhere. The • work still continues, however, and the zeal manifested by the workers is greater than ever, even though results are not so great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two days ago I returned from the island of Barbados, where </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">had been visiting the brethren. During the time we had the privilege of putting on three programs of your speeches, “Kingdom Blessings,’’ “Holy Year,’’ and “Way of Escape”, records of which had been taken from Trinidad. At the large theater the attendance was on one occasion more than 850, and at the other a few less. “Holy Year” was put on at a smaller theater, the large one being not available to us that day. The audience gave excellent attention on each occasion, and, at the last, attention was called to your statement regarding the transcription machines and the people were further invited to hear you by that means the second Sunday of each month at the Bridgetown company’s meeting room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding the year just over, would report that somewhat less literature was distributed than the year previous, but that the number of testimonies was greater. This, together with the fact that there were a few less workers, shows that greater effort was put forth; also, there were many more obtainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The island of St. Vincent had a better witness than formerly, due to visits of brethren from other islands; all, including the sister resident there, did good work. Three sisters from Barbados took time and covered the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Lucia has also had the privilege of getting some of the good news of the Kingdom. A pioneer brother has been there now some months and was pleasantly disappointed in the way that the literature went out. There was also some free advertising, for Cathohcs were warned against the hterature, from both the pulpit and the confessional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine is steadily gaining in popularity amongst the people who dare to think, so that from time to tune we have had to request small increases of the quantity being sent; 635 distributor copies are now being taken care of, besides those which go direct to subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An intercolonial convention was held here during the month of April. Brethren assembled from the neighboring islands of Barbados, Grenada, St. Vineent, Tobago, and from British Guiana; also, of course, from the various companies in this island. A good witness was given and much encouragement and refreshment resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This island has had very unusual weather during the past few months, and there has been loss due to damage by wind and water; also there has been much anxiety. We seized the opportunity to instruct the people by special efforts to distribute amongst them the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities: The Cause; The Eemedy.</span><span class="font4"> Many now reahze that, instead of thus afflicting them, Jehovah is going to bless them with the kingdom for which they have so long prayed, and that the calamities come from the enemy of God and mankind.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Not a great deal of witness work has been done in Turkey; but during the past nine months one pioneer has been actively engaged in the service there. He reports 10,070 testimonies and placed in the hands of the people 361 books and 2,759 booklets, or a total of 3,120. Other literature is being shipped to Turkey, so that we hope the work will increase there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font5">Yugoslavia is a very poor country and the people are much downtrodden. The conditions are unfavorable. Notwithstanding this, there was an increase of 7,591 books and booklets distributed over last year. The office is now located at Belgrade, and the country is more accessible therefrom. During the year bound books were placed to the number of 3,106, and booklets, 38,100. The brethren in Yugoslavia are showing increased zeal for the service and are pushing the work with greater vigor than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is copied from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aside from smaller difficulties when representatives of Gog tried to wrongfully accuse Jehovah’s witnesses in the press and from the pulpit, we have not had much trouble. The people in general receive the truth gladly, and even the ruler appears to be sympathetic towards the truth, for he has received seieral personal testimonies and also the books. Of course, there are some who are blinded and who oppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At present we have 8 pioneers, and 70 company workers from 10 companies, and these have distributed during the year 3,106 books, 38,100 booklets, 1,728 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and 72 Bibles. There were held 72 company gatherings, with 1,732 attendants, and 56 meetings for interested persons, with an attendance of 3,918. Letters and cards received, 240, letters and cards sent out, 762.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has declared that all shall know that he is God. It seems clearly to appear that now is the time when those who have been taken out from the world for his name’s sake must deliver Jehovah’s message to the rulers and to the people that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is here. The enemy and his agents on earth, particularly the Catholic hierarchy, continue to fight desperately against Jehovah’s witnesses This is to be expected. Regardless of all opposition Jehovah’s organization, like a great war chariot, moves majestically forward The ivorld is in a great economic depression and steeped in crime, and this condition continues to grow worse. The people of good will desire to hear the message of truth; hence the work of advertising the King and the Kingdom has progressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the year ending September 1932 slightly more than twenty-two million books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. For the year ending September 1933 more than twenty-four million books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people; an increase of approximately two millions over the preceding year. In the report for 1932 it appeared that from the year 1922 to the year 1932 the distribution of the books and booklets carrying the message of the Kingdom aggregated 132,779,040. For the year 1933 the output exceeded any previous year, as above stated, bringing the total distribution since 1922 up to 156,853,441.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These figures do not take into consideration, however, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which during that period of time has been devoted exclusively to present-day truth published twice each month, and would aggregate the equivalent of 1,309,040 bound books. In addition thereto are also the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Books,</span><span class="font5"> issued once each year since 1926, and the distribution of which up to the present time aggregates more than 214,204 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the praise of Jehovah and his King has been sung by those who love him and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to be regretted, however, that with a few of the companies of Jehovah’s people there are some who formerly held the office of “elective elder” and who still think that they should spend their time by giving addresses before the companies or others that might be assembled. Such do not seem to have an appreciation of the way the Lord is carrying forward his work. Jehovah’s capital organization is functioning according to his will. Every one in that organization must be a witness, and the method which the Lord is blessing ought to be sufficient evidence that the work is being carried on according to his will. The radio and- transcription machines advertise the truth and open the way for approach to the people, and then the individual workers carry the message into the homes of those who wish to hear. Personalities do not enter into the matter at all. If the Lord has assigned one part of the work to some and another part to others, then each one should be glad to do his or her part and not covet the work that is assigned to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the brethren have expressed their opinion that the president of the Society is given too much advertisement and that others should be advertised somewhat. Be assured that the advertisement is not of an individual, but only in connection with the truth. Probably somebody else could do it better, but let each one be content with what the Lord gives him to do. There are very few munnurers, however, walking along with the real ones. The Lord’s parable concerning the laborers in the vineyard clearly shows that there would be some murmurers, and we should expect to find some; but this will not at all disturb the ones who really delight to do with their might what their hands find to do and not worry about what somebody else is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the teachers, and all in the temple are taught by them and not by men. Some in the organization are used to print and manufacture literature, while others are used to put it out; but there is no preference to anyone. All are one compact body engaged in a common cause, and those who really love Jehovah and his kingdom are following organization instructions without murmuring or complaining. With all such the year has been filled with joyful service, and the faithful workers today are strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year concludes with Jehovah’s witnesses fully united in spirit and in the service of the Lord. Those really of the temple are avoiding all controversies with those who oppose the method of carrying on the work. The faithful fully appreciate the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the capital organization of Jehovah, that he is the great Prophet, and it is the privilege and duty of each one of the faithful class to be obedient to his commandments, as it is written; “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory,” and not of the glory of men. The faithful remnant have but a single purpose, and that is to do faithfully the will of God. They keep in mind the precious words written for their comfort: ‘‘Jehovah sitteth as King for ever. Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.” (Psalm 29: 9-11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> With full assurance of faith, and strong of hope, the faithful continue their onward march, giving praise to Jehovah’s name. With gratitude to the Giver of every good and perfect gift, and to his Chief Executive Officer, this report is respectfully submitted.</span></p><img src="yb1934_E_files/yb1934_E-3.png" alt="" style="width:74pt;height:29pt;">

<p><span class="font5">Pursuant to the charter of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and the by-laws governing the corporation, the annual meeting was held at Pittsburgh, N.S., Allegheny County, Penna , on the 31st day of October, A D. 1933. In the absence of the president the vice president presided. The meeting was opened with the usual and customary invocation to the Lord. Thereupon the vice president stated the purpose of the meeting and caused to be read a communication from the president of the Society. On motion duly put and carried it was ordered by the annual meeting that the annual report of the president be printed in the usual form. This was unanimously carried. There being no business at the meeting except the usual and customary routine, upon motion duly put and carried the meeting adjourned sine die.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark148"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">his name shall the nations hope” —Matthew 12:21, R.V., margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH is not trying to save anyone. He tries to do nothing. Having purposed a thing he does it in his own due time. His way is the only way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many are the worldly schemes now being made known, for which great claims are made as a means of world recovery. All such schemes are certain to fail. The people are now greatly discouraged and distressed. None of the worldly schemes give them any hope. They must now be plainly told that world recovery is an impossibility. The reason it is impossible is that Jehovah has entered his final judgment for the complete destruction of Satan’s world. There is no appeal from that judgment. It will be executed at Armageddon. Until then Satan will continue to bring woe upon the people in an endeavor to turn them all away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time is here when all must come to know that Jehovah is God. Those devoted to Jehovah know that Christ is man’s Redeemer and that the way to eternal life and blessings is through faith in God and in Christ and a full devotion to his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jonadab class, meaning those people who have good will toward God, now learn that Jehovah’s kingdom is the only hope for the human race. Many of them are carrying this message of good news to their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peoples of the nations must now learn that the name of Jesus Christ is the only one through which they can receive the gift of life and attending blessings. (Acts 4:12) Jehovah has laid upon his witnesses the privileged obligation to point the people of the nations to the way of escape and to the only hope for them. The text for the year is especially appropriate now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of the old world’s being recovered, it shall pass away and be succeeded by a new world wherein dwelleth righteousness. (2 Pet. 3:10,13) What the people need, and what the obedient ones will get, is regeneration. Let all who believe the truth tell the people now of and concerning God’s kingdom under Christ and point them to the great truth that ‘in his name shall all the nations hope’. The day is at hand for the deliverance and blessing of the people; and let those who love God and his kingdom rejoice and continually sing forth his praises. So far as you are concerned, make the year one wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thy name, 0 Jehovah, enduieth for ever; thy memorial name, 0 Jehovah, throughout all generations —Ps. 135: 13, A R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s name is the greatest memorial ever given nil 'a.men. “This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.” (Ex. 3-15) Jehovah expressly sent an angel from heaven to declare the name unto men. (Ex 3: 2-5) Before that holy and memorial name even earth’s most haughty and powerful ruler, Pharaoh, Satan’s representative, must bow abjectly and acknowledge that Jehovah is the name of the One who is almighty and whose word is of supreme authority and cannot be challenged and opposed successfully. The first declaration of that name brought conditions that required an early vindication of it. The complete vindication of that memorial name, soon now, will cause it to be cherished forever in the memory of those who live.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the Lord said unto him, 'What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the ground —Ex 4: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1914 the time had come for Jehovah to send forth his beloved Son, whom Moses pictured, to make for himself (Jehovah) a name. It was then that he sent him forth to rule amongst the enemy. That was the appropriate time for Jehovah to propound the question to Christ: “What is that in thine hand?” He is sent to shepherd the nations, and his rod appears then to be a “rod of iron”. (Ps. 2: 9) The rod is a symbol of authority and power which Jehovah has delegated to Christ Jesus to be used to carry out Jehovah’s purpose. Moses’ casting the rod to the ground pictured the projecting or extending of the active power of Christ Jesus to things pertaining to the earth. Thus he did when the war in heaven took place and Satan was cast down to the earth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/33</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; according to all that thou de-siredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb.—Deut. 18:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah had given Moses this knowledge nearly forty years previously, and in all of that time Moses had kept it to himself. At Sinai Jehovah told Moses of his purpose to raise up the Great Prophet. Moses’ words concerning the coming of the Great Prophet were spoken to the Israelites shortly before their entrance into the land of Canaan. After Moses had delivered Jehovah’s message to the Israelites, he served notice upon Egypt and her ruler. The prophetic work of Moses was to make known the will of God by delivering Jehovah’s testimony. The work of Christ during the Millennial reign will not be to bear testimony to Jehovah’s people and to then serve notice upon Satan’s world. All this must be done now, before the restoration of mankind begins. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/33</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(52)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daniel spake and said, 1 saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. — Dan. 7:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The invisible part of Satan’s organization is pictured as the four winds of heaven. That invisible power was exercised over the human race, which was already alienated from God. As a result “four great beasts came up”. These are four world powers, beginning with Babylon, which is the first and which is followed by Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome, all different from each other, but all being borne up and supported by the people alienated from God and hence under Satan’s control. Thus Jehovah pictures the world powers from Babylon down to the British Empire, manifestly to identify that part of Satan’s organization which defiles Jehovah’s sanctuary. This Jehovah reveals to his faithful ones now. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/33</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">January 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(267)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourcis into his vineyard—Matt. 20:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The parable of the penny applies to those who have been called and have responded to the call for the kingdom and to those taken into the covenant for the kingdom. A number of such become murmurers, while the others respond with gladness to whatsoever they received from the Lord’s hand. The householder mentioned here is Jehovah. Early in the morning when the householder goes out to hire laborers is sometime between dawn and sunrise. (Mark 13- 35) Jehovah gets his work under way early in order to get in a full day by all the workers. It was in 1918 that Christ Jesus came to the temple as the official representative of Jehovah, and “early in the morning’’ would be shortly thereafter, corresponding with A D. 1919, which was really early in the “new day’’. Just preceding this was a dark time of persecution. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Ilar-Magcdon.—Rev. 16:16, ARV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Has the battle of Armageddon begun? Senpturally the answer is, No A mountain symbolically represents Jehovah’s organization. The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mageddon</span><span class="font5"> means a place for the assembly of troops, while the prefix </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ar </span><span class="font5">or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Har</span><span class="font5"> in the word Armageddon means mountain or hill; hence the word Armageddon means the high mountain or hill where Jehovah’s troops are assembled or gathered together. These troops assembled at Armageddon are Jehovah’s troops, including the remnant on earth. In Revelation 14: 1 the Lord shows his troops to be made up of the 144,000 with Christ Jesus, and assembled on Mount Zion, that is to say, gathered together in Jehovah’s organization. Satan, knowing that soon the final battle must be fought, and the issue determined, proceeds to gather together his forces to bring them against Jehovah’s organization. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1 /33</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou wilt keep him tn perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in thee.—Isa. 26: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “higher powers” are those of Jehovah’s organization to whom Jehovah has delegated authority to do work in his name. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the “higher powers”, while Jehovah himself is the supreme power. In the invisible part of Jehovah’s organization are the faithful saints who have been raised to glory with Christ Jesus; while on the earth there is a visible part made up of those who are wholly devoted to God and to his kingdom. These latter ones are called “the remnant” and must have the mind of Christ if they will receive God’s final approval. With such all instruction from God’s organization must be carried out, not to please men, but to honor and please God. God’s servant keeps his mind set upon knowing and doing the will of God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. —Ps. 5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one would want the name that Jehovah confers upon his witnesses unless he loved God. Others are ashamed to bear the name of the Most High. This is proved by the fact that those who delight to be known as Jehovah’s witnesses are the objects of scorn and ridicule by those who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pretend</span><span class="font5"> to be followers of Christ but who in fact are not. In giving the new name Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s steward pays the wages and acknowledges before Jehovah those not ashamed to be called by his name. “For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s.” Only those who love the Owner of the vineyard would be entirely satisfied with the wages received and would rejoice on receiving the same.

<p><span class="font5">Knowing God and his commandments, Satan permitted his own selfishness to harden his heart in the face of God’s loving-kindness. It is even so with those who since have received the enlightenment of truth from Jehovah God and who have then permitted self to rule them. It is not the loving-kindness of God that hardens the heart of the wicked, but it is selfishness on the creature’s part exercised in the face or light of God’s loving-kindness that hardens the heart pf the creature. Love is the perfect expression of unselfishness. Hence selfishness is the very opposite of love; and selfishness persisted in and followed in a lawless manner shows that the creature is devoid of love. He reaching that condition, “there is no fear of God before his eyes.”—Rom. 3: 18. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s vengeance is against every part of Satan’s organization because that organization has defamed God’s name, deceived the people and turned them away from God. The offenders must have notice served upon them, and those deceived, but who may desire to know the truth, must have an opportunity to hear it, that they may take their stand on Jehovah’s side. Those who fear man or desire to please men, or who, to avoid the criticism of men, fail or refuse to obey the Lord in declaring his vengeance against Satan and his organization, cut themselves off from Jehovah’s organization and are gathered out and set aside. Until God sent forth Christ Jesus to reign, even he was commanded to say nothing and do nothing against Satan, but when the due time came Jesus began his vigorous action against Satan the enemy, and the Lord declares that ‘in that day all the faithful must willingly do the same thing’.

During that period numbers of the consecrated became careless of their covenant with the Lord and indulged in many speculative schemes and prospered; and because of their love for money such have lost their vision of God’s purposes and have perished, being ‘drowned in the sea’.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the express image of the Father Jehovah. At all times Christ Jesus has had his mind in harmony with Jehovah. All who are in Christ Jesus, and who continue to please Jehovah, must be in full accord with the mind of Jehovah. Jehovah is righteous, and with him all things are right; he always does that which is right. His mind is reflected in this, that he provides light for those who have a mind attuned to righteousness. It is from the Word of God that man learns what is the true mind of Jehovah. Men learn of God and of Christ Jesus through the Word, and this they must do in order to live. (John 17: 3) Those who love God, and who call upon him in truth and in sincerity, he hears because he loves righteousness and those who seek to know the way to do right.

They fear God, they are anxious to please him and to continue for ever in his favor. Therefore they pray the above prayer. It is only those who know Jehovah and are upright in heart that present this petition in sincerity and with certainty of receiving a favorable answer.

<p><span class="font5">Above all peoples on earth the remnant should use discretion. It would be foolish to tell everyone you meet who is occupying a position in the world that he is of the Devil and that the Lord is going to kill him. Remember your commission and preach what you have been instructed to preach, that is, says Jesus: ‘What I have told you in the darkness [the secret place, the temple] that go out and speak in the light, and preach it from the housetops.’ Let the remnant deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ, and not the distorted views of some others, nor take a foolish and unwise course. Those who faithfully follow the Lord’s instruction are certain of persecution.

<p><span class="font5">The hand of a creature on earth who is in a covenant with Jehovah symbolically represents the divinely provided ways and means or equipment of that creature to actively engage in the service of Jehovah. Moses was sent to Egypt, not to deliver his own message, but to deliver Jehovah’s testimony. Jehovah had provided the ways and means and had equipped Moses to do that service. For Moses to become negligent or slothful in performing that service would be illustrated by putting the hand in his bosom, even as Moses did. “A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. ‘ ’ (Prov. 19: 24) He who would thus do would become poor and an unfruitful servant.

<p><span class="font5">There has been a tendency on the part of all men to receive honor of other men. Almost all men when assigned to a position of trust delight to keep their own name before others, that they might receive honor of men. Such was not the mind of Christ Jesus. His speech proves beyond all doubt that he was never selfish. He told those about him that his Father had appointed him to judge the world, and had given him authority to execute judgment; then he added: “I can of mine own self do nothing.” He magnified his Father’s Word by saying to his hearers: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” Thus he shows how his own mind was fixed, and also the only proper means by which a man can ascertain God’s will. Jesus had come to earth to do honor to his Father’s name, and not to receive the approval of men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses made up of the faithful remnant have issued a challenge to Satan’s organization. The clergy and those once in the truth, but who are now opponents, claim they have the right to speak for Jehovah and that therefore the remnant are presumptuous in claiming to be Jehovah’s witnesses. They enter into a conspiracy to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. Gog, Satan’s chief officer, forms a conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses and draws others into it. By faith in God’s Word, and by the extraneous evidence showing the fulfilment thereof, Jehovah’s witnesses now see that this conspiracy has been formed and that overt acts are being committed in furtherance thereof.

<p><span class="font5">Satan’s organization is powerful and wicked beyond the description of words. That organization is fatally bent on the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses. Satan and his agents use all the power they possess to accomplish that wicked end. Doubtless the enemy will succeed in killing some of the faithful, but not even that fact will in any wise deter the faithful witnesses from rendering full obedience to the Lord. If members of the remnant should die at the hands of Satan and his agents at the time when they are failing or refusing to obey the Lord, then the wicked one would ‘touch them’ fatally. If Satan kills some of the faithful while they are in the performance of the duties as commanded by the Lord, then “that wicked one toucheth him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not”.

These are not opened for the accommodation of the great Judge, but the opening means the illumination of the prophetic books contained in God’s Word, which are opened for the understanding of Jehovah’s faithful people taken into the temple, that they may, according to his will, declare his judgments previously written. They must make known that Jehovah’s name will be vindicated, and that is now being done. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/33</span></p>

Under the law of God given by Moses adultery was punishable by death. Adultery, in the higher meaning of that term, is illicit relationship between a member of Christ’s body and Satan’s organization. (Jas. 4: 4) For any member of the body of Christ to compromise with Satan’s organization, and which wrongful act is done while in the body of Christ, is a disobedience of the law of Christ subject to be punished by death. Let no one of the remnant think that because he is in the body he can lead a loose or indifferent course.

<p><span class="font5">At the Columbus convention in 1931 Jehovah made known to his people that he had given them a new name and had constituted them his witnesses and made them a part of his elect servant, to whom alone he gives this honor. This manifestation of his loving-kindness is too great for us to fully comprehend. Those who have seen and appreciate this favor from Jehovah have joyfully entered into his service to testify to his name. Regardless of all hardship and vicissitudes that now beset them these faithful ones go on in the Lord’s strength, knowing that soon victory will be complete. Only the faithful anointed appreciate that they are the children of Jehovah by his woman Zion and that they are all taught of God.

<p><span class="font5">The serpent is a symbol of evil, but not always a symbol of wickedness. The “rod”, or power and authority which Jehovah delegated to his beloved Son, now takes on the form of evil to the things pertaining to the earth, that is, Satan’s organization, which is now confined to the earth. Evil is that which is hurtful and brings distress, affliction and sorrow upon the one against whom it is used. Jehovah God exercises his power to inflict punishment or to enforce his judgment, and such results in evil or that which hurts the wrongdoer; but that evil is righteously used. When Jesus punishes his enemies, that is evil administered in righteousness. Therefore easting the rod to the ground and its becoming a serpent foreshadowed the extension of Jesus’ power to the earth, which becomes hurtful to Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/33</span></p>

This is clearly illustrated in the destruction of Korah who rebelled against the truth of Moses which Jehovah had given to him; and this Jude cites to show that there is a class of the consecrated people of God who go into destruction after having been enlightened. (Jude 11) Because of their greater enlightenment and greater privileges the responsibility resting upon the anointed must be far greater than that which will rest upon the people during the Millennial reign; hence the most important part of the fulfilment of this prophecy relates to the time when Christ Jesus is at the temple for judgment of the house of God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/33</span></p>

Even though they are not anointed of the Lord, yet it is certainly God’s will that everyone who hears the truth and loves it may have the privilege of telling it to others.

That means that they must be entirely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom in order to be clean; as it is written: “Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (Isa. 52: 11) The faithful remnant, without slacking of the hand, must continue to deliver the testimony of Jehovah until Satan’s organization is destroyed.—Isa. 6: 11.

Likewise the Lord Jesus as the great ^Executive Officer of Jehovah now causes the representatives of Gog and the Devil on earth, and who claim to be worshipers of God and whose claim is false, to fully identify themselves This they do by taking action against God’s anointed ones.

The oppressive power of the Anglo-American imperialism, particularly against the people of the Holy One, will continue until the final judgment is executed.

He is obedient to the “higher powers”. That which is pleasing to God is faithfulness in the performance of assigned duty. The remnant are specifically commanded now to be obedient to the “higher powers”, to wit, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, which includes the orders that are sent to the remnant through Jehovah’s organization.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s announced purpose is to have for himself a dwelling place, or palace, upon which he places his name and which shall magnify his name for ever. Such place or palace of dwelling is designated in the Scriptures as his “sanctuary”. Jehovah’s sanctuary is his capital organization, or chief part, of Zion. ‘ ‘ For the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation.” (Ps. 132.13) The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the temple of Jehovah in 1918 marks the time of Jehovah’s taking his place in his sanctuary. Then it was that he builded up Zion. It was in 1922 that the remnant began to see the going of Jehovah and his “Messenger” into his sanctuary. The sanctuary is that which is wholly and completely devoted to Jehovah. It is his holy temple. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This could not be applied after the faithful are taken to heaven, but must have fulfilment while the faithful remain on earth as representatives of Jehovah and his kingdom. Earth’s nations could not see the honor Jehovah conferred upon the witnesses after they are removed from earth to heaven, and this prophecy shows that these witnesses are observed by the nations. The peoples of the nations of the earth must know that Jehovah is God, and that he has a people on earth who are faithful and true to him and who maintain their integrity toward him. God’s purpose to destroy the nations forming Satan’s organization must be made known, and he confers upon his faithful ones the new name, and they are granted the honor of going forth and announcing Jehovah’s judgments before they are executed.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">thy wrath is come.—Rev. 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wrath of Jehovah here mentioned is against the wicked Satan, who refused to vacate and to give way to Christ and who is therefore ousted for ever from heaven. Jehovah did not make the nations angry and cause them to go to war and kill each other. This is proved by the faet that their killing each other is a violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant. All the suffering and death resulting from the World War is properly chargeable to Satan. That war was not an expression of Jehovah’s wrath against the nations and peoples of earth. The war in heaven between Christ and Satan was an expression of Jehovah’s wrath, and the casting of Satan out of heaven as a result thereof was the occasion for great rejoicing of all the heavenly host. War between the nations could in no way whatsoever vindicate Jehovah’s name. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The taking away of the continual sacrifice, the casting down of the sanctuary, and the setting up of the abomination, take place practically at the same time. The commercial element, military power, and strongarm squad of the seventh world power, supported by the religious “arms”, or power, and by the political ruling power, did “pollute the sanctuary of strength ”, which is Jehovah’s sanctuary, because He is their strength. At the time of bringing forth the League of Nations compact the faithful people of God on earth had been “cast down” to the earth, and their opportunity to offer the continual or daily sacrifice of praise and service to Jehovah was taken away, and Jehovah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’s </span><span class="font5">name was therefore defamed.

<p><span class="font5">The householder of the parable is Jehovah God. The steward is the Lord Jesus Christ at the temple. The laborers are those at the temple for judgment, and who engage in the service of the kingdom. The hire or penny is the honor of being given the new name which Jehovah gives to his people. The time of fulfilment of the parable is after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment. The parable has its fulfilment while the faithful are on earth, and eternal life is received at the end of a faithful course on earth. (Matt. 19: 27-30; Mark 10: 30) In order to enter into the resurrection inheritance one must be a son of God and be faithful while on earth. It is the faithful son that inherits with Christ, sharing with him the glories of the kingdom. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The trumpet of God is not the same as the “seven trumpets”. The seven angels that had the seven trumpets are the angels of the Lord Jesus Christ at the temple who are sent out by him with a definite message, and this is done while the trumpet of Jehovah is sounding. Mark that the Scriptures make a clear distinction between the trumpet of God, which begins to sound at the coming of the King, and the seven trumpets which the King himself caused to be sounded by his angels sent out from the temple. The facts and the Scriptures show that Christ Jesus appeared at the temple to build up Zion in 1918, at which time the trumpet of Jehovah was sounding. Thereafter, beginning 1922, the seven angels sounded. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The faithful witnesses of Jehovah see that the day of entering into their everlasting inheritance is now </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font5">hand. They know that there must first eome, however, the battle of the great day of God Almighty and that they must bear the testimony of Jehovah until the great battle is fought. The enemy has come up and encamped against them, expecting to block their advance movement. Jehovah’s witnesses, small in number, have no strength within themselves, but their faith and confidence in their leader Christ Jesus and their King Eternal Jehovah is absolute, and in that strength they can accomplish God’s purposes. They see that the name of Jehovah which they are now privileged to bear is their high tower of refuge, and into it they run and are safe.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.—Luke 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the follower of Christ desires the approval of men he is certain to become disturbed and discouraged. What man’s opinion is of and concerning another is wholly immaterial. Whatsoever is God’s finding concerning the creature is of all importance to him. The approval of Jehovah is the only thing worth while. If one is wholly devoted to God he will not become discouraged by reason of what others may say or think of him. When one knows he is diligent in obeying God’s commandments, and that he has Jehovah’s approval, the esteem or lack of esteem in which others hold him is wholly immaterial. Satan has undertaken to turn all against Jehovah, declaring that no man will be wholly faithful and true to Jehovah God. Therefore high esteem of the creature is to that extent a support of Satan’s boast. The approval of God is what one must have to be safe.

<p><span class="font5">If the new creature in Christ has his mind set upon God and his kingdom and his heart devotion is wholly to God, even though his organism is flesh and he is very imperfect yet in God’s sight he is not in the flesh. He who has the spirit of Christ has the mind of Christ, and is therefore spiritually minded. He is devoted to God’s kingdom and is not at all lifted up or disturbed by the things of men. Satan the invisible one and his wicked host are warring against the new creatures in Christ Jesus, the same as they did against Christ himself; and the follower of Christ, in order to be spiritually minded, must be against Satan and his organization and wholly for Jehovah and his organization. There can be no compromise. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare. —1 Tim. 6: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the Elijah period there was a class that stressed the importance of “character development”, deeming that to be great gain and therefore godliness, because it would insure the developer a place in heaven. Another class, meek and humble, desired only to please the Lord, and while these looked forward also to a place in heaven, and that properly, their chief and great desire was to serve Jehovah and Christ Jesus. At Christ’s coming to the temple for judgment the two classes began to be made manifest, to wit, the class moved by selfishness and which class quickly developed into the “evil servant” class; and the other class, moved by unselfish devotion to God and his kingdom and which class Jesus formed into the “faithful and wise servant”. To this faithful class the Lord committed his testimony on earth, and he invites them to enter into his joy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As the Son of God Jesus was perfect, but as a Son who was at all times obedient to his Father he had not suffered and there was no occasion for him to suffer. He was made a perfect man, and now Jehovah would have him prove that a perfect man can be subjected to all manner of suffering and still maintain his integrity toward God. This being done, such would prove Satan a liar and would be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus must therefore go through all manner of suffering and through it all he must be, and was, obedient to his Father. If he had not suffered there would have been no proof that he would be obedient under suffering. His constant obedience under the most terrible suffering proved Satan’s boastful challenge absolutely false, and hence was the vindication of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">In the covenant confirmed by Jehovah with Israel at Sinai the people were asked if they would perform their part thereof. They expressed their willingness to do so. In the covenant made in Moab there was no such request for them to agree to do God’s will, because they had already agreed to do God’s will, when they left Egypt. Likewise those in the covenant to do Jehovah’s will at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple must be willing to accept the terms of any additional covenant, which is in fact a covenant of faithfulness, and they must prove faithful before entering into their inheritance. The covenant for the kingdom includes continued faithfulness and obedience unto God and his kingdom. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This prophecy refers to something that is based upon the ransom sacrifice, growing out of it and in addition thereto, to wit, the daily, continual presentation of the bodies of God’s faithful servant class, publicly giving testimony to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom. Mark that the British-American empire system, which is “Christendom”, in which both Catholics and Protestants operate together, did take away the daily presentation of the testimony of Jehovah and his kingdom, and did thus cast down the sanctuary class to the ground; and this was done in the year 1918.

<p><span class="font5">To think more highly of oneself than one ought to think is pride, and this causes one to deport oneself haughtily. Pride is therefore the fruit of selfishness and is the very opposite of love. One who really loves Jehovah cannot be proud. It is selfishness resulting in pride that has led some into the “evil servant” class. Jehovah shows his faithful saints the wicked and what has led them in the wrong way, that the faithful may avoid a like course of wrongdoing. Seeing this the faithful walk humbly before God and pray: “Do not suffer to invade me the foot of pride.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> This prayer is accompanied by watchfulness, and they walk circumspectly, refusing to give honor to any creature and to think of themselves in a lofty manner, but thinking of themselves as creatures of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and giving to him all honor and glory. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Co're led a rebellion. (Num. 16:1-35) Jehovah organized Israel according to his own will and directed Moses and Aaron what to do, and they did his commandments. Korah challenged that arrangement, claiming that he had a right to perform certain things. Therefore he put himself against God. Korah and his allies professed to be the safeguards of the liberties of Israel by insisting that God’s work be done in a different manner from what the Lord had pointed out. By taking issue with Moses and Aaron, Korah and his allies put themselves openly against God, who had made the order. Jehovah destroyed those rebels. This proves that the “sin unto death” is committed by those who willingly disobey God’s commandments, and by putting themselves in opposition to God they make themselves his enemies.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah employs signs or miracles to bear testimony; hence it is written that ‘the sign has a voice’. The term “voice” means a proclamation or address. It is a message bearing testimony concerning Jehovah’s purposes. Jehovah at times has given his creatures the power to perform miracles or signs, which signs bear testimony of Jehovah’s purpose and from which testimony the wise derive profit. Man has no power to interpret such signs. The Lord makes them clear in his due time, and he usually reveals the same to his people by having them perform something in fulfilment of the prophecy and then discloses to his faithful the meaning thereof. This is always a strengthener to their faith. All honor and credit is due to and is gladly given to Jehovah God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It was 1918, after the Lord’s coming to his temple, that the bitter opposition against the kingdom message and those who deliver it began to be especially marked. Since that time the arrest and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses has continued with marked hatred and malice expressed by the powers of the various nations. As the witness work has greatly increased Satan and his representatives have been more vigorous in their opposition and the persecution of the faithful has increased with intensity. It is within “Christendom’s” realms that the witness work must be done and is being done. It is the nations which compose “Christendom” that maliciously hate and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses.

That men have been taken out of the world and made a part of the elect and have maintained their integrity toward Jehovah disproves Satan ’s contention and is to that extent a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The purpose of selecting this company of elect is that Jehovah’s name might be made known before the final battle. ‘Jehovah at first did visit the nations to take out of them a people for his name.’ The elect must be used for Jehovah’s purpose at the time he ‘plants the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth ’, at which time he makes it known that Zion is his organization.

There his faithful organization follows him in his righteous cause. The acts of these must be righteous and clean and must so continue if they would remain in the organization of the Lord. Indifference, slothfulness or slackness of duty will mark such as disobedient, and disobedience means destruction. In the Lord’s army no one of the faithful has a thought of compromise with the enemy. The fight to the finish is about to take place, a fight that will vindicate Jehovah’s name.

When on earth he refused to speak anything except as the instrument of his Father, and that to the honor of his Father. His doctrines at all times are according to godliness, that is, always to the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, which means a course of complete righteousness. There are those who indulge in severe criticism of the remnant; they oppose the work of the Lord’s servant class in delivering the kingdom message and have therefore specifically rejected Jesus’ words that this gospel of the kingdom must be preached as a witness to the nations. Such presume that their selfish gain in personal attainments is godliness.

The setting up of the League of Nations, “the abomination that maketh desolate,’’ occurred at the end of January, 1919. Therefore the latter date marks the beginning of the 1,290-day period, or three years and seven months. Counting three years and seven months from that time would necessarily bring the end thereof to the beginning of September, 1922. At this latter date God’s faithful people announced the King at the temple, and this was done by a resolution declaring Jehovah is the only true God, Jesus Christ is the King, the kingdom has begun, and the League of Nations is the product of Satan. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Jehovah puts his hand upon a creature, that means that Jehovah has selected that creature and clothed him with authority to perform certain duties in the execution of God’s purpose. Ezekiel had a vision concerning which he said: “An hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein.” The roll or book is a symbol of a message or testimony of Jehovah, and its being in a hand symbolically says: ‘This testimony is provided by the power or spirit of Jehovah, and this is his means of making it known.’ The “hand of the Lord” upon his prophet clearly means that Jehovah has bestowed upon his creature divine favor and authority to represent him in bearing testimony, and this he has done by Christ Jesus, his chief means of carrying out his purposes, or his right hand. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/33</span></p>

This disclosure doubtless has the same effect on the class composing that enemy as Jesus’ words had upon Judas, the type thereof, when Jesus said to him: “That thou doest, do quickly.” From that time Judas was definitely identified as Satan’s instrument, and he let the Devil take complete possession of him. Since the publication of the truth concerning the “man of sin”, clergymen have uttered the most vicious and wicked speech against Jehovah’s witnesses and have used their power and influence to have these witnesses suffer bodily harm.

It is not correct to say that Armageddon has begun and that the worst part is yet future. There is a wide distinction between the trouble that is upon the world and the battle of Armageddon, the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Jehovah has had no part in the trouble now upon the world. When he does take action in that connection, it will be so emphatic that there will be no reason to doubt that it proceeds from him and who is responsible. All will then know that Jehovah is God and that he is taking action and that Jehovah is supreme.

<p><span class="font5">Now the facts show beyond all question of doubt that the papal religious system, the Protestant religious system, the “evil servant” or “man of sin” class, and all other institutions of Satan’s commercial organization are in a conspiracy against Jehovah’s faithful servant class. Satan knows that the faithful servant class are God’s representatives and prospective members of Jehovah’s new nation. Therefore Satan seeks to prevent such from becoming a nation. This is another evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses have God’s approval and that all religions, religious workers and other agencies that oppose the work of giving testimony to God’s kingdom are a commercial organization, carried forward under Satan’s deceptive influence and direction to defame Jehovah’s name and turn man away from Him.

<p><span class="font5">The fulfilment of this prophecy corresponds exactly with the Lord Jesus’ coming to the temple and the gathering together unto him God’s covenant people, which dates from A.D. 1918. From then on Christ Jesus the Great Prophet has instructed and enlightened the temple class and thus has especially shown to them the meaning of the name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> and that the primary issue is the name of Jehovah, and that the work of greatest importance is the vindication of that name. Jehovah put his words in the mouth of Christ Jesus, and that Great Prophet has instructed and enlightened those who are of the anointed class. All the facts show beyond a doubt that the greater fulfilment of the prophecy begins with the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, and King greater than Nebuchadnezzar, addresses his proclamation to “all peoples”, which means primarily those people on earth who as his followers are maintaining their integrity toward Jehovah, and secondarily the Jona-dab class, meaning all those of good will who desire to know and to do the will of the Almighty God. This includes particularly the “sheep” class, who are pleased to do good unto others because they believe and understand that such others are servants of the Almighty God and his beloved Son. Here then are shown also the faithful followers of Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s witnesses bringing the message of the proclamation to all others who have a hearing ear. These are messengers of peace and, quoting their Lord, they say: “Peace be multiplied unto you.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The issue is now squarely before every one of the remnant. About that issue there cannot be the slightest doubt. Each one of the remnant must courageously and confidently face the issue Moses prophesied that Jehovah would raise up another prophet, of whom Moses was a type. Peter repeated that prophecy at the temple shortly after Pentecost, which prophecy has its fulfilment at the present time while the Lord Jesus Christ, the great antitypical Moses, is at the temple for judgment. The responsibility of obeying him rests upon those of the temple class Disobedience on the part of such means their destruction, as the apostle Peter put it: “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Having completed his petition regarding the enemy, the psalmist then gives expression to a fixed determination to be faithful to the Lord in service, and expresses his satisfaction and approval of the Lord and says: “I in righteousness shall behold thy face, shall be satisfied when awakened by a vision of thee. ’ ’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Let me be satisfied with the display of thy glory.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Sept.)</span><span class="font5"> This clearly has reference to the faithful ones’ meeting the Lord at the temple and learning that they have the Lord’s approval. Thus they appear before him righteous, having received the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation; and this is evidence of approval. Such full assurance brings them great satisfaction, and in the psalmist’s words they exclaim: ‘We are satisfied.’ W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/34</span></p>

With Jesus the great and important part of his work was and is to vindicate the name of Jehovah, which Satan has defamed With those who have the mind of Christ the great and important work of theirs is to have some part in vindicating that name. Up till now Jehovah has permitted Satan to remain and to continue to pursue his wicked course. Now he has enthroned his beloved Son as King and sent him forth to rule Jehovah’s judgment is that Satan and his organization must be destroyed, which work Christ Jesus will shortly do.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.—1 John 3: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Transgression” (Dan. 8-13) means a ‘revolt, or rebellion’, that is, a willful violation of God’s law. The willful disobedience of God’s law is sin. Paul wrote: “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” (Rom. 7: 7) That means that the responsibility for rebellion or transgression attaches to the wrongdoer completely from the time that the wrong is committed and the wrongdoer receives knowledge that the wrongful act so committed is a violation of God’s law. One might do wrong and not know it was a violation of God’s law at the time; but when this knowledge is brought home to him the responsibility particularly attaches from that time forward God holds men responsible only after they have received knowledge.

The scripture seems to say that the wicked one know<sup>r</sup>s that the name Jehovah means “I will be what I will be”, and therefore he deliberately sets himself in opposition to Jehovah by refusing to give heed to Jehovah’s commandments and hence in effect says of himself: ‘‘I will be what I will be.” The oracle of transgression in his own heart thus prompts him and moves him to action He has no fear or dread of Jehovah. Being impressed with his own importance he follows the dictates of his own selfish heart. A prompting power in his own selfish heart, which is contrary to God’s law, directs his course of action.

<p><span class="font5">Satan began the tribulation in 1914, and Jehovah stopped the wholesale slaughter in 1918 and thus shortened the days of tribulation for his own purposes. The tribulation was begun by Satan and carried on in unrighteousness, but soon Jehovah will take an active part therein, by Christ Jesus, and will “cut it short in righteousness”. That part begun by Jehovah will be the battle of the great day of God Almighty, sometimes called “the battle of Armageddon”. Only Jehovah’s restraining hand has held back Satan’s forces and thus prevented destruction of the remnant Jehovah declares he will remove this restraint and let Satan’s forces under Gog and Jehovah's forces under Christ join battle, and the result will be the complete destruction of Satan’s forces. That will be the worst tribulation ever on the world, and the last. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These words of Job are prophetic and refer to the fall of mankind and of his overlord, and Jehovah’s gracious provision for the recovery of fallen man that he may again live. Doubtless Job had observed the peculiarities of the cedar tree, which under certain conditions will produce a new tree out of a dead stump. His prophecy is an expression of Jehovah’s purpose to again give life to the obedient ones of the human race, even as He caused the new tree to grow up out of the roots of the old stump. God works in a plain and simple though mysterious way his wondrous acts to perform and to reveal them to those who love him. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/34</span></p>

He having purposed to do a thing and having given his word as expressing that purpose, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">failure to accomplish that purpose would prove that his name does not stand for everything that is good, pure, holy, righteous and all-powerful. The experience of Job discloses that the question or issue raised by Satan involved the name of Jehovah God, and the record there shows that his holy name must be completely vindicated. Jehovah God accepted that challenge and permitted the test to proceed. Should Satan eventually prove the truth of his boastful challenge the name of Jehovah would stand for ever blemished. But if Satan fails the name of Jehovah God stands completely and for ever vindicated. Satan is doomed to complete failure. The victory is given to the Most High.

It was the day on which his name was exalted and proof was given beyond denial that his name means just what it imports The Lord spoke to Moses in marking off and establishing that day. Centuries after Moses that same day marked a further vindication of Jehovah by his only begotten One, Christ Jesus; hence the Son of God decreed that the day should be observed by his devoted followers as a memorial day. On that day the powers of darkness and wickedness seemed to triumph; but not actually so, for The Man whom Jehovah had put on earth as an answer to Satan’s defiance proved his integrity to his God, even though God apparently slew him.

To submit God’s message of truth to any part of Satan’s organization for censoring or examination that permission might be given to deliver it, or to ask permission to preach the message, is a gross sin against God, rendering the offender unclean because he is thus touching a dead body, that is, Satan’s organization. The only way to be cleansed from such sin, even if committed inadvertently, is by deep humiliation, supplication and prayer before Jehovah, acknowledging the sin, and by the washing of the Word, and then following faithfully the instruction of God’s Word.

<p><span class="font5">The hands of the anointed cannot remain clean if they ‘touch the unclean thing’, that is to say, Satan’s organization. There can be nothing in common between the Lord’s people and the enemy organization. The witnesses of Jehovah are God’s people, taken out for his name, and they must remain true and faithful to his name. Their love for him can have no qualification or limitation. They must and will give Jehovah all of their love. Thus the apostle expresses it in behalf of himself and his brethren who are devoted to Jehovah: “I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, . . . nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s name continues to be enlarged in the mind and heart of his anointed remnant on earth. Once we believed that the chief purpose of the passover in Egypt, and the institution and celebration of the memorial of Jesus’ death, was to magnify the importance of the ransom sacrifice, the deliverance of the body members of Christ, and the ultimate deliverance of all the obedient ones of mankind from bondage to sin and death But the paramount truth taught thereby is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The chief purpose of sending Moses to Egypt was to vindicate Jehovah’s name. All the precious doctrines pertaining to the ransom sacrifice, the selection and deliverance of the church, and the deliverance and blessing of mankind, are incidental to the vindication of the name of the Most High.

<p><span class="font5">Like the passover lamb, Jesus was, as it were, roasted in the broiling heat of fiery trials to the limit, but maintained his wholeness, his integrity to the last. Those in the world (Egypt) now receiving the benefits of his death must publicly profess faith in God’s arrangement respecting his blood. They must nourish themselves by feeding on him, and thus strengthen themselves to march out of Satan’s organization. No leaven of sin may be indulged in while they feed on him. The herb-like bitter things experienced in Satan’s world must not discourage them, but sharpen their appreciation of the faithfulness, integrity and merit of the “Lamb of God”, and cause them to feed on him the more and strengthen their determination to keep their integrity.

In 1914 the great wonders or signs began to be made manifest when Satan’s mighty organization met in conilict the still mightier organization under Christ Jesus in the war in heaven, which resulted in ousting Satan and his wicked crowd from heaven.

Jesus was a faithful and true witness respecting Jehovah’s agents and arrangements, and hence could not truthfully put himself out of the picture. If one loves, worships and praises the great Jehovah, one cannot ignore and set aside Jehovah’s appointments and arrangements, namely, that Jesus is his great executive officer, “the way, and the truth, and the life.” One must accept and feed upon him whom Jehovah provides upon the great passover table. Jesus is Jehovah’s chosen instrument for vindicating his name; hence it is Jehovah’s will that all creation shall honor and worship him, the “bread of life”.

It is the name of Jehovah that is involved, and now his beloved Son, having been appointed to the office of vindicator and executioner, bears the name of his Father. Jehovah honors him above any and all others. Jehovah puts his spirit upon his beloved Son, and the Father and Son are one, that is to say, in complete unity for the accomplishment of Jehovah’s purpose. The Father is Master, and Christ Jesus his Son is the Servant, hence subject to Jehovah. “Christ” means the Anointed One of Jehovah; which means that Jehovah has commissioned this mighty One to carry out his purposes.

<p><span class="font5">As a cleanser from sin Jesus’ blood is that in which he washes us from our sins. (Rev. 1: 5) But to drink that blood, symbolized by wine, symbolizes something more than remission of sms. It symbolizes death out of which there is a resurrection to a fuller life. In John 6: 53-56 Jesus shows that those who drink his blood are those in unity with him, and hence in unity with his Father, for he and his Father are one. Such, Jesus said, he would raise up at the last day, thereby showing that “life in you” would be gained first after death, after which death there would have to be a raising up again. The “life in you” conferred is immortality, and is given only to those who feed upon Jesus and drink of his blood. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Clearly these words have to do with the judgment upon the faithful and the unfaithful. Hypocrisy means that one professes to be what he is not, or conceals what he is in fact. This is determined by his course of action. If one claims to be a witness of Jehovah, then he must, in order to be consistent, give testimony as to what he has learned in Jehovah’s temple or secret place. Jehovah has taken out a remnant people for his name, and the only way for these to be consistent and faithful is to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah. It is in the secret place or temple that these witnesses have been taught, and now they go out as Jehovah’s witnesses and speak with authority, not their own message, but the message from the Lord.

God commanded Moses- “Thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the Lord) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel ” (Num. 3-41) Moses as a Levite was included in this exchange and hence was used as a substitute for a firstborn.

That which they have in common with Christ is a joint participation in the work and sufferings of the Christ, together with Jesus and with one another. One who drinks Jesus’ blood in symbol at memorial ought consistently to be keeping the picture faithfully by drinking Jesus’ blood figuratively, and that is by suffering with him even unto the death, keeping unity and integrity.

<p><span class="font5">Gathering the REMNANT to the temple and teaching them is not necessary for their salvation. What, then, is the real purpose of gathering them there? The Scriptures answer that such are gathered to the temple for the purpose of bearing testimony. They are made the witnesses of Jehovah and to them is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ. They are brought into the temple and instructed, that they may know what to say as such witnesses. The instruction the Lord now gives to his people is not merely for their own edification or encouragement or self-indulgence or self-development. It is given to them to use as directed. Their commission is to preach concerning the kingdom and to tell the people of Jehovah’s works, and hence they receive instruction at the temple that they may do this w<sup>r</sup>ork intelligently and properly according to the Lord’s purpose.

<p><span class="font5">The symbolic bread and wine were used at one and the same time. There is no Scriptural authority for separating the one from the other, as far as the memorial is concerned. The bread was eaten and the wine drunk only by the faithful eleven who had been invited into and who w<sup>r</sup>ere in line for the kingdom. Thereafter those who have properly kept the memorial according to the Scriptures are those in line for the kingdom. Such constitute the bride class. The bride welcomes the* Bridegroom and rejoices at his coming, and it is wnh the bride class that Christ Jesus drinks the wine of joy after coming to the temple. The faithful remnant yet on earth continue to ‘show forth his death’ even though the Bridegroom has come, because they know they must die with him and get life immortal by partaking of his resurrection.

<p><span class="font5">There is absolutely nothing in this world upon which the people can hope, hence the nations are in despair. Standing out boldly in contrast to the miserable condition of the world is Jehovah’s gracious provision for obedient mankind. He has made Christ Jesus his vindicator and has placed the name of Christ above every name save that of his alone, and he calls upon the people to hear his great King and to learn the importance of his name. The remnant yet on earth are made the witnesses of Jehovah and are commanded to point the people of good will to Jehovah’s kingdom and his great King. The name of Christ Jesus stands for the kingdom of Jehovah, which will vindicate Jehovah’s name. There is no other name in which they can hope or whereby they can possibly be saved. Jehovah’s witnesses must therefore point the people to this one and only hope. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/34</span></p>

His suffering and the manner of his death came because of persistent activity as “the faithful and true witness” of his Father Jehovah. Therefore his faithful footstep followers cannot truly “ drink his blood ” unless they “ know . . . the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death”. That means activity as a faithful witness and servant of Jehovah down to the end, and that in the midst of a world alienated from God. Their faithfulness in serving as Jehovah’s witnesses draws the enemy’s fire against them. Jehovah’s witnesses must expect and receive persecution and suffering as long as Satan’s organization exists. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/33</span></p>

The bread loaf symbolizes not only Jesus’ body once broken, but also the oneness now existing between all who are “partakers [members] of that one bread [loaf] ” and the oneness of all the body members of Christ with their Head now present at the temple. What strength of heart this unity imparts to all who eat worthily at the memorial! It is indeed now the day of deliverance, the deliverance which comes together with the everlasting vindication of the memorial name, JEHOVAH.

It is also, in larger measure, now an occasion of unbounded joy. The kingdom of God has come. The Vindicator-King has come to the temple and is at the feast.

This does not mean the gospel merely of ‘Christ Jesus and him crucified, but it says “this gospel”, meaning the good news that the kingdom is here and that now Jehovah will make a name for himself. This is the very purpose of the Greater Moses in setting up the kingdom. No one who remains in the body of Christ and receives the crown of life will side-step that commandment. All the faithful will delight to take up the glad news and herald it to the world as a testimony, declaring it to the people of good will and serving notice upon Satan's organization.

This fact has been vigorously challenged, the contention being that there are sincere ministers who preach and who are preaching the gospel as they believe it. The answer to that is that sincerity in belief does not make one a servant of Jehovah God. It must be conceded by those who defend them that such ministers preach doctrines that are selfish and never tell the people about the vindication of Jehovah’s name by Christ Jesus, and that their hope rests in faithfulness to God and his kingdom. The preaching of error, even though done in all sincerity, tends to turn the people away from Jehovah God and thus makes the preacher of such error a servant of Satan.

The definition of the word “money” cannot be properly limited to the com of the realm or the thing which is used as a medium of exchange or measure of value.

He knew what Jehovah had done and was doing toward him and what he had sent Jesus to do. He had learned how his Father had exercised his own mind, and he was determined to do the same thing in the same manner.

All human creatures are imperfect, but when such creature, relying upon Jesus’ blood as his redemptive price, is brought into the covenant with Jehovah and brought forth by the spirit of God, he is counted a new creature, even though in an imperfect organism. He can become holy then by entirely and completely devoting himself to Jehovah, and to do this he must have the mind of the Lord.

During the period of time which Jesus was commanded to sit on Jehovah’s right hand and wait his true followers on earth must obey his words: “Pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you ’’ This they have done and have made no attempt to retaliate, having in mind always that Jehovah said: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.” During the period of waiting above mentioned, by praying for their enemies the followers of Christ have shown themselves in exact harmony with God’s will, to wit, to wait for his due time to execute them. The time of God’s forbearance comes to an end and he sends forth his great Officer against the enemies, and now his witnesses pray he will destroy his enemies and do it now.

The “faithful servant” class sees the lawless completely broken down and without ability or strength to ever rise again. This will be a further vindication of Jehovah’s name. The loving-kindness of Jehovah is ever about those who truly love and serve him. The kingdom is here. The forces are gathered for the final determination of the great question long at issue. The enemy now appears to be strong and very formidable. Danger appears to the faithful remnant; yet with full confidence in Jehovah they now say: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower, the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” Let Jehovah be for ever praised!

<p><span class="font5">No man properly takes honor or dignity to himself. Jehovah has declared his purpose to give his specific honor or dignity to his “servant”. Nor does it appear from Scripture that Jehovah gives honor to individuals aside from his beloved Son. While Jude used the word “dignities” in connection with creatures, yet manifestly the reference is to the office filled by creatures, and not to the creatures themselves as such. The “faithful and wise servant” class on earth is counted a part of Jehovah’s ‘elect servant’. It is that “servant” to whom Jehovah gives honor and glory and who therefore as such “servant” is a dignity. Evil speech against Jehovah’s “servant” is therefore speaking against God, because against God’s honored one. The “evil servant” class hesitates not to speak against God’s “faithful servant” class on earth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The greatest of all questions for determination is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. All other matters are subsidiary thereto. The salvation of the human race or any portion thereof will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name and prove his supremacy, but the salvation of the human race is not the important thing. On the other hand, by placing the truth before his creatures and giving life everlasting to those who willingly obey him, such is a vindication of his name and results beneficially to the creature that obeys. When the wieked are destroyed, and those who love God and are obedient are given life, such proves that Jehovah alone is the Supreme One and worthy of all worship and joyful service. That will settle for ever the question of supremacy, and then all creation will see that only the obedient ones are given life everlasting by the Most High. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the Lord Jesus from the beginning was ‘daily the delight of Jehovah’, we must conclude that there has been at all times a confidential relationship between God and his beloved Son; hence Jehovah would disclose to his Son each successive step of the outworking of his great purpose. The Son would early‘learn that the redemption of man from death, in which Satan had plunged the race, the setting up of the government of righteousness, and the bringing of man into harmony with God, in which men would then maintain their integrity toward God, would be a vindication of his Father’s name. He determined to do his Father’s will at any cost. The all-important thing with Christ Jesus was and is to do his Father’s will, the doing of which he knows will vindicate his Father’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/33</span></p>

When mankind had grown in numbers Satan brooded over that symbolic sea of human creatures and brought forth the wicked, beastly organization by which he has since ruled the world In his organization he has made prominent three elements, to wit, commerce, religion and polities, and with this organization, all of which is mercantile, Satan has filled the earth with violence.

His kindness is his favor bestowed upon his creatures, and such kindness unselfishly bestowed by him is called his loving-kindness. The Most High is “kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil”, but the selfish creatures spurn God's loving-kindness and go on in their wrongful course.

The worldly “wise men” of Satan’s religious, commercial and political organization had completely failed at that time to solve the mystery concerning the human race, and in 1918 Jehovah installed his Son as Judge at his temple and gave commandment to the nations that they should hear him.

(Lev. 23: 24) The sounding of the trumpet also signifies war, battle and victory, and with the Lord’s coming it means war against Satan and his organization, a great battle and complete victory for Christ.

Jesus answered that question and said: “If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? Fear them not therefore.” (Verses 25, 26) As Jesus suffered contradiction and persecution at the hands of Satan’s agents, so he makes it clear that all his faithful disciples must be subjected to the same thing, for the reason that it is enough for the disciple that he do as his Master.

Concerning the sanctuary and its cleansing Jesus said that he would send forth his angels and gather out the offenders and lawless ones, “and shall east them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 13: 42) It thus appears that after the sanctuary is cleansed those on the outside of the temple will weep, wail and gnash their teeth.

(Rom. 8: 9) It is the love like unto that which Christ has that constrains or binds together the members of Christ’s body, causing each one to have uppermost in mind the doing of Jehovah’s will, that they may honor his name and have a part in its vindication. No one who is looking for greater honor for himself could have such love for God and for his brethren in the Anointed One. Those who have been long in the service, seeing the later ones enter, who are pictured by Esther and Ruth, delight to know that their younger brethren share equally with them in the honor conferred by Jehovah upon his people of bearing his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/33</span></p>

For the same reason the apostle wrote: “I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.” (2 Cor. 7:4) As Jehovah’s witnesses go forth and with boldness declare Jehovah’s name and his King and kingdom persecutions and sufferings will be their lot. But the people of good will must be told that their only hope is in the name of Jehovah’s great Vindicator and they must identify themselves as being on his side.

Clearly these are the people who become Jehovah’s witnesses and who must continually and faithfully perform their part of the covenant before entering fully into the inheritance.

It is at the present time that Jehovah’s words apply to the faithful remnant: “Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. ’ ’ The kingdom of heaven is here because Christ has begun his reign.

This is where the “little horn” stands up against the Prince of Peace and attempts to change times. By his law Jehovah has decreed that all shall worship the King of Eternity and give their allegiance to earth’s rightful ruler, Christ Jesus, and he commands his saints to tell the people and the rulers of Satan’s world that God’s kingdom has come.

Would the men of the Radio Commission look over the message of truth and approve it and say, Speak on? They would not; but, on the contrary, they would turn on Jehovah’s witnesses and denounce them. Why then insult the Lord by disobeying his commandments? Shall God ask the Devil or anyone of his representatives if his message shall be delivered to the people?

The cleansing of God’s sanctuary, therefore, must mean the complete separation of all of God’s people from those of Satan’s organization. Only the cleansed can offer an acceptable sacrifice unto Jehovah. Therefore the cleansing of the sanctuary must mean the removing from that company once in line for the kingdom every one not wholly devoted to God.

Jehovah’s name is greatly magnified in the mind of each one of the remnant because they now see that the vindication of his name is the all-important matter.

<p><span class="font5">The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is carried on particularly in those countries claiming to be “Christian” and by means of organizations and the action of men who profess to be followers of Christ. Why, then, does Jehovah permit his anointed thus to suffer persecution? Manifestly there are two separate and distinct reasons. One is to give those who are opposing God’s kingdom an opportunity to identify and mark themselves, even as Jehu caused the Baal worshipers in his day to identify themselves. Another reason is that such persecution affords the opportunity to Jehovah’s witnesses to prove their love and complete devotion to Jehovah. Christ Jesus suffered the contradiction of sinners, and likewise the faithful remnant must suffer. Otherwise they could have no part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

Without a question of doubt one who first believes in Christ’s blood as the ransom sacrifice, and who enters into a covenant with Jehovah, and who then renounces the blood of Christ as the purchase price of man, thereby for ever deprives himself of life. The greatest part of the sin, however, is the willful transgression against God’s will, and hence that is the sin unto death. It is an insult to God and a repudiation of God’s provision. There are other ways of committing the sin unto death than by denying the ransom.

Necessarily that means that all the anointed members of Christ’s body must be fully obedient unto him if they are finally approved and given immortality. The coming of Christ Jesus to the temple is for judgment, which judgment he conducts as the duly appointed and anointed one of Jehovah.

This part shows that Jehovah determines the tune when the final battle of the day of God Almighty, Armageddon, is to be fought and when it shall end.

This being accomplished there is no further need for the rod to be used as a serpent. Jehovah’s power and authority delegated to and used by Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Moses, ceases to operate as a serpent at the conclusion of the battle of the great day of God Almighty.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God did not suffer bodily pain or mental anguish by reason of the wrongdoing of his creatures. He is at all times serene and self-contained. There would be no reason why he should suffer bodily or mentally. “Suffer,” as used concerning Jehovah, means he has permitted without hindrance the wicked one’s continuing his work. In other words, Satan operated by the sufferance or permission of Jehovah. Man being left to exercise his own free will, almost all of human creation have yielded to Satan, and to that extent it would seem that Satan had largely succeeded in his boastful challenge. Jehovah in due time will prove to all that he is the only true God, the Giver and Sustainer of everlasting life, and that he gives life to those who love, serve and obey him.

Those who keep his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one great commandment</span><span class="font5"> now are certain to find in him complete refuge and safety. “There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

This prophecy fulfilled on a greater scale at the temple judgment shows that there would then be a class to whom the name “Jeshurun” once applied and who would afterwards become unfaithful and forsake Jehovah. The name “Jeshurun” signifies a close relationship between Jehovah and his people. Such a close relationship is promised to those who enter into the covenant to do God’s will, and which they receive upon condition of faithfulness. Those who had responded to the call for the kingdom, and who stood before Christ at the temple for judgment, therefore were all at that time included in that name “Jeshurun”, but the name continues only with those chosen and who continue faithful.

The creature that hears his testimony and becomes obedient thereto is wise. The creature may be very simple, and yet if he inclines his ear to the testimony of Jehovah and deports himself in harmony therewith he becomes enlightened and wise. There is no reason to be in doubt about the testimony of Jehovah. It is unchangeable, sure, solid, steadfast and immovable.

It was his will that Satan and all his army should remain in heaven until the end of the waiting period; and that the rebel army should then be ousted from heaven, and this was promptly done by Christ Jesus. At the present day earthly ruling powers, acting wrongfully, try to interfere with the giving of the testimony which Jehovah has commanded shall be given by his witnesses on earth. By so doing these earthly rulers are saying to Jehovah: “What doest thou?” but they shall certainly be brought low and learn that Jehovah is supreme.

The Lord Jesus now says to his faithful remnant: ‘Do not fear to tell the truth in the presence of the enemy and his representatives. The Lord has nothing to hide. Let the truth be told.

No one laboring in the vineyard could possibly accept more than a penny, because that was the wage promised those first entering and they certainly had no right to demand any more. If it pleased the Owner to pay all the same amount, regardless of time engaged in labor, that was his own affair. No one could rightfully demand more, whether that be in the way of honor, position or other preferential treatment Those in the foremost positions in the service of Jehovah’s organization have no right to demand something for themselves.

There never was a time that Jesus was disobedient to his Father, but he must suffer in order to learn obedience </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">under suffering</span><span class="font5"> and thus prove that under suffering he would be obedient. Therefore in all his sufferings Jesus learned obedience and steadfastly maintained his integrity toward Jehovah. In Gethsemane Jehovah gave Jesus assurance that his death as a sinner would not be a reproach to the name of Jehovah, but that eventually Jehovah would use that very thing to the vindication of his name. “And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.” Thereafter Jesus exhibited no fear whatsoever.

A separate and distinct covenant was made with them in Moab; it was not a mere repetition of the one confirmed at Sinai, but relates to the covenant for the kingdom. After one is called to the kingdom, he must be chosen or taken into the covenant and then must prove faithful. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/33</span></p>

These earthly rulers, being a part of Satan’s organization, are likened to ferocious beasts. As part of the roots of the old tree stump in the earth these rulers have not reached out for the life-giving waters of truth, and hence have learned nothing. As it is written: “Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.

None on the earth can have an appreciation thereof now except those entirely devoted to God. For the benefit of the last members of Christ’s body on the earth Jehovah made many pictures. He confirmed a covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai, and forty years later he made another covenant with them on the plains of Moab. This latter covenant corresponds to the time when Jesus gathers together those called to the kingdom and who are approved and brought into the covenant for the kingdom. Thus being chosen they must remain for ever faithful God’s covenant people, gathered at the temple, are all designated at first as “Jeshurun”, but only the approved ones retain that name.

<p><span class="font5">If it be contended that both the sleeping faithful saints and the faithful ones on earth are changed in the same instant, then resurrection of the dead could not precede the change of the living; but when we understand that “at the same time with them” means within “the day of Jehovah”, which began in 1914 and continues until the close of Armageddon, the matter is entirely clear. Christ shall descend from heaven “with an archangel’s voice”, which means the chief angel or chief messenger of Jehovah, which office Christ Jesus fills. He comes “with a shout”, which means an authoritative command. Being sent as earth’s rightful ruler, Christ Jesus is in command and his commandments are given with absolute authority.

If now he is moved by a selfish desire for greater personal ease for himself or for others and leaves the Lord’s service and engages in a worldly business, he walks right into the enemy’s snare, which often causes the one taking this course to be ‘drowned in the sea’.

There is a close relationship between the Lord and those of the temple class, which close relationship was not discernible until the Lord came to the temple, gathered the faithful ones there, and taught them; and it was then they became satisfied.

Jesus Christ, the Head of the temple class, there sets them in this place obscure to the world, and says to them: ‘What you hear in this place, you are to go out and tell to others, even shout it from the housetops.’ In the secret place, the place obscure to the world, they have been instructed.

As the Egyptians thought the Nile waters were good to drink, so the people of the world, including many of the consecrated, have thought that the commerce of the world is vitally essential, refreshing and life-sustaining; and hence some of the Lord’s people have engaged in the world’s commerce and later have come to sorrow.

Their fight is not with carnal weapons, but consists in faithfully resisting the enemy, and faithfulness in bearing the testimony of Jehovah and declaring that his vengeance shall be executed upon Satan’s organization.

Those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah, therefore, can have no part in the selection of such rulers. The fact that Satan has been permitted to continue exercising overlordship of man does not contradict this. Jehovah has suffered it to be so, having fixed a time certain to permit Satan to work out his strongest practical argument to support his beastly challenge of Jehovah’s position. Thus Jehovah has bided his time to prove Satan the most fertile liar in the universe. Jehovah’s directing Jesus to remain inactive and wait until 1914 to begin his work of interference with the enemy proves that Jehovah is “the Most High [that] ruleth in the kingdom of men”, and is supreme.

The purpose and honest hope of the laborers who entered the vineyard service was to receive Jehovah’s approval as workers that need not be ashamed, and that is exactly what the new name means to those now joyfully engaging in the kingdom service.

For centuries Jehovah has permitted Satan to pursue his course of wickedness, and to the limit In all that time of wickedness among creation Jesus Christ has boldly upheld and exalted Jehovah’s name At all times he has maintained his integrity toward Jehovah. That action on his part makes manifest the mind of Christ. The greatest thing before his mind has ever been the vindication of his Father’s holy name.

<p><span class="font5">The one thing that the wise do and will continue to do is to love Jehovah. The great commandment which is first in time and first in importance is that the creature must love Jehovah God. This question was propounded to Jesus: “Master, which is the great commandment in the law?” The answer of Jesus proves that there is one primary commandment. This commandment Jehovah made of paramount importance, and it is emphasized by the wicked challenge flung into the face of Jehovah by Satan the Devil. When God had led Israel out of Egypt he gave this commandment to his people, that they must love him if they would live. As secondary to the great commandment Jesus says: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself”; no more and no less. All the law and the prophets depend upon these commandments because a failure to keep these would make the keeping of others of no real value. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W12/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All reasonably sane persons desire to have life and to dwell in peace and to enjoy the things which God has provided for them. No human creature can realize such desired blessings until he learns whence they come and what he must do to obtain them. Jehovah God sent his beloved Son to earth that man might believe in him and live and not perish. That means that without knowledge and without belief mankind must perish. The life of the perfect man Jesus provided the redemptive price for man, but in order for man to reap the benefits thereof he must know Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and choose to be obedient to the righteous laws of his kingdom. Jehovah has made provision for the people to learn, and he lays the privilege and obligation upon his witnesses to now declare to them that their hope is in his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">The judicial decree is rendered by Jehovah and is announced and executed by the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are also “the watchers”; they are the watchers over Jehovah’s name, and that pertains to its vindication. The purpose of the decree is “to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men”. Hence the supreme purpose is the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the settlement for ever of the question of his supremacy and inherent rulership. When Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah that marked the beginning of the time when the world’s rulers shall no longer plead ignorance but must know that Jehovah is God.—Ps. 83: 18.

<p><span class="font5">Who could question the right of Jehovah’s doing with his own according to his will? The Steward would not think of doing contrary to his Father’s will; hence he would pay the wages as directed by the Householder, Jehovah. Jehovah needs no one to give him advice as to the manner of disposing of his gifts or paying his wages: “For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?’’ Selfishness is the very opposite of love, and hence results in injury or evil. The improper motive manifested for moving one to action is another way of stating that the creature has a bad or evil heart. The desire to have something better than one’s brethren is selfishness, leading to darkness. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The clergy magicians of Satan’s organization make the waters of truth to appear bloody. They and their allies in wrongdoing cry out that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a commercial enterprise of selling books for pecuniary profit, and that by going from house to house and doing this without obtaining a license from worldly authority these witnesses are violating the commercial laws of the land. In this manner the modern magicians attempt to turn the waters of Jehovah’s testimony, now being delivered by his witnesses, into that winch is death-dealing. The commercial, political and religious elements attempt to prove to the people that they have power to rule and to remedy the present evil conditions.

A failure or refusal to thus pray would prove that they were not loyal to God. The remnant, therefore, do not hesitate to utter the prayer set out for them by the words of Jehovah’s prophet. They pray for the complete destruction of the wicked that all who desire righteousness and life may see that Jehovah is the righteous One and the Giver of life.

In various places laws have been enacted to govern the peddling of merchandise. It never was the intention or purpose of the lawmakers in framing such laws to interfere in any wise with the preaching of the kingdom gospel. But particularly since 1918 the enemy has seized upon these laws long ago on statute books and uses them as an instrument to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses. Because they call upon the people with books containing the kingdom message and accept from people a contribution less than cost to make and deliver the books, Satan’s religious representatives cause such gospel preachers to be arrested on the charge of ‘peddling without a license’. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/33</span></p>

It is a spiritual reward or wage, having a peculiar value to those who are in the covenant with Jehovah and which wage can be turned to their account on earth in having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. No greater wage could be paid to creatures on earth than that of receiving a name at the mouth of Jehovah God and which name shows the close and confidential relationship between Jehovah and his faithful people. Never before has he given such a wage to creatures. He will never give it to others than the faithful followers of Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">At Eden God had foretold the destruction of Satan. Now the judicial decree recorded in Daniel’s prophecy foretells the destruction of Satan and his organization. Although the decree was made and entered of record immediately following Satan’s rebellion, his overlordship of man was not at that time taken away, but Jehovah suffered Satan to continue in that office until his own due time, that is, until the coming of him ‘‘whose right it is” to take the overlordship. This period of time is the same time mentioned in Exodus 9: 16, during which Jehovah permits Satan to remain in order that He might demonstrate his own great power and in order that his witnesses might proclaim this fact before Satan’s destruction.

It has often been necessary to stir up the Lord’s people to greater zeal and activity. In harmony with this Jesus spoke the parable of the virgins. These virgins were looking for and waiting for the coming of the Lord, the Bridegroom, but they had fallen asleep and were slumbering. “While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.” Some of the watchers were asleep, that is, lying down at rest, while others slumbered, nodding because it was hard to keep awake; and when it was discovered that the Lord had come to his temple there was a cry for them to awake and arise.

Since 1918 the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Moses, is at the temple, and he affords the people the opportunity to take their stand against or on the side of Jehovah. The “sons of Levi’’ stand before the Lord at the temple for trial and purging, and those who come through the fire and are approved are made a part of the Lord’s house that they may offer unto Jehovah an offering in righteousness.

The lesson there to be gained is that when one becomes unfaithful to God and turns against God’s organization those who remain faithful and true to the Lord God are not to weep or mourn nor to regret the loss of the companionship of the wrongdoer. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/33</span></p>

To love means to be unselfishly and wholly devoted to Jehovah God without qualification or compromise. There can be no division of one’s love, part being given to Jehovah and part to a creature. If one’s own self stands in his way or interferes with his love for Jehovah, then self must be put on the side. If one’s neighbor or any creature stands in the way of complete devotion to Jehovah that neighbor or other creature must be put aside.

That there is great danger of bodily harm there is no doubt; but let the remnant always have in mind that Jehovah has taken them out from among the nations as his witnesses to bear testimony to his name and has given them his name, and to them the name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Let the testimony work which the Lord has committed to his people continue to be given; let the remnant in doing this work be moved by the zeal befitting the sons of God. Those who will share the kingdom glories must now be faithful and true witnesses to Jehovah’s name, telling boldly and joyfully what they have learned at His temple.

<p><span class="font5">The ‘ ‘ watchers ’ ’, Jehovah and his Logos, commanded that the tree stump should remain, and the manifest reason is for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The original stump pictured the human part of the organization of which Lucifer was made overlord. Leaving the stump was a guarantee that mankind and his home on the earth would not be finally destroyed, but that Jehovah would create another overlordship which would guarantee to the obedient ones of men a righteous government, under which they might live forever. This shows that the “stump” is directly related to the kingdom of Christ and that the recovery of mankind must be by and through the redemptive blood of Christ Jesus and his kingdom.

Jehovah is now causing his testimony to be given before the world’s rulers, both visible and invisible, that they may never have excuse to say that advantage was taken of them. He is also causing this information to be given to the people desiring righteousness, that they may take their stand on His side and live. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord brought to the attention of his people their relationship to him and caused them to adopt the resolution concerning the new name, on July 26, 1931. No greater wage or honor could be conferred on any creature on earth than to bear this name as given by Jehovah. The Scriptural argument in support of the resolution at its adoption called attention to the fact that the “white stone” is given, not to individuals, but to the “faithful and wise servant” class collectively as a class and is a token of Jehovah’s approval and the designation of such class as his official representatives on earth. No individuals are singled out and given a preferential place, but all together the remnant constitute the servant, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses to declare his name in the earth. The length of time the first laborers in the vineyard have been serving is not material. The degree of faithfulness to kingdom interests was of all importance.

The paramount reason for sending the prophet Moses to Egypt furnishes the key to the understanding of the above prophecy. That purpose was the vindication of Jehovah’s name. When Jehovah sent Moses to Egypt he carried his rod in his hand, which symbolically corresponded to the time of fulfilling the words of Jehovah, to wit: “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” This fixes the time of the coming of the Great Prophet foreshadowed by Moses and of the fulfilment of the prophecy on the grander scale, and which time began with the year 1914.

That adverse judgment does not mean merely the death of the body, but the complete destruction of the creature; that is the end of the existence of that creature. Now the question at issue with the remnant is, Shall we fear that Satan’s agents may kill us, and because of that fear refrain from going forth and boldly proclaiming the truth, which truth we have been taught by the Lord at the temple? and if because of such fear we do refrain from going out and telling the truth, what then?

The will or determination of the wicked is to carry out his own selfish purposes, and this in utter disregard of God’s expressed law; hence he is properly called a willful or lawless person. He is moved to act by reason of his own selfish desires, and, such desires being lawless, it is properly said an oracle or moving power of lawlessness or transgression is in his heart and this moves him to action.

That great hope is that the creature might receive eternal life in a spirit organism, be made partaker of the resurrection of Christ, and therefore ‘‘belike him” and be for ever in the favor and service of Jehovah God. Such is the “hope set before us” and which is “an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the vail, whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec ’ ’.

When the remnant are gathered by the Lord to himself at the temple, the organism of flesh is not that which is gathered, but the creature, which now has only an organism of flesh; and the natural eyes of that organism cannot see that which is in the spirit, but those of the remnant can discern spiritual things. How do the anointed remnant know they are now gathered to the temple of the Lord? Because they have the witness of the spirit, and the Scriptures and facts. They are with “the Lord in the air’’, that is, in the condition where the natural eye cannot see that which is present. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The spirit of selfishness was apparent in the days of the apostles, and in the present time selfishness is more rampant than ever and the apostle’s words apply with stronger force. The apostle admonishes all who will please God and find complete refuge in him that they must separate themselves from all who are moved by a desire for selfish gain, whether that gain be the accumulation of earthly wealth and power or a gain that comes by the honor, plaudits and approval of men and causes the gainer to shine amongst men. (Verse 11) The apostle therefore distinctly points out that those who will receive God’s approval and find in his name a complete refuge must separate themselves from all others that pursue a selfish course.

<p><span class="font5">The reward was strong in the minds of the laborers who were first hired to go into the vineyard. The vindication of Jehovah’s name, which is the all-important thing, was not then seen by those sent into the vineyard in the early morning. Approximately A.D. 1919 God’s organization Zion gave birth to her children, which children here constitute the laborers sent forth “early in the morning”. Since the laborers could bring no value to the householder, the wages paid them is a gracious gift from Jehovah God which he pays to them while on earth and at the close of a specific time in which they are engaged in the kingdom work. All the laborers at the close of that particular time received the same wages or hire, regardless of how long they were employed in the service and worked in the householder’s vineyard.

<p><span class="font5">It is not necessary that one be brought forth as a spiritual son of God in order to commit the “sin unto death ’ ’. He who receives some enlightenment concerning Jehovah and his beloved Son the Redeemer of man knows what is right and what is wrong. If, possessing such knowledge, that creature then willfully, that is, knowingly and intentionally, persecutes or opposes the brethren of the Lord Jesus Christ, because they are proclaiming the truth of Jehovah’s kingdom, the deeds of that creature are wrong and done against the Lord. Jesus laid down this rule, which rule he declared would be enforced when he appeared at the temple for judgment, when he said that the doing of wrong to the least of his brethren was doing it unto him: “And these [wrongdoers] shall go away into everlasting punishment.”—Matt. 25: 46.

Addressing the consecrated the apostle says: “For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit.” (Rom. 8: 5) The visible creatures of Satan’s world are flesh, hence called “carnal”. If one who is in a covenant with God to walk in Jesus’ footsteps has his mind divided between the things of Satan’s organization and the things of Jehovah’s organization, he is unstable; and unless he takes his stand wholly on the side of Jehovah, and sets his mind and affections on the things of God’s kingdom, he cannot live, but must die.

<p><span class="font5">The faithful sleeping ones, such as the apostles, were first resurrected and gathered unto the Lord at the temple, that is to say, built up into Zion. This was followed by the assembling of those who remain alive, that is, the remnant. The fact that they are gathered to the temple and are there taught of Gcwd is proof conclusive that they are with the Lord “in the air”, that is, in the condition where it is impossible for the natural eye to see that which is present. If they are at the temple with the Lord, then without a question of doubt they are with the Lord, and he is invisible to their natural eyes Thus the words “caught up . . . to meet the Lord in the air” fully describe the condition.

The words further show that Jehovah’s witnesses, to maintain integrity toward Jehovah, must now amidst much opposition and suffering make known to the peoples that Jehovah is the Most High, that the time for his kingdom is here, and that the King has come and is upon his throne.

In the Lord’s vineyard are laborers in various positions. According to the divine rule, when the paying-off time arrived, everyone in the service, regardless of position occupied in the vineyard, must be treated exactly alike.

The Society is, by the Lord’s grace, bearing witness to Jehovah’s name as he has commanded. If the Society is doing this according to the will of God, then the eomplainers are murmuring against God, just as the parable of the penny discloses when it says: “And when they [the first workers] had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,’’ who is Jehovah.

Jehovah anointed the temple class, gave to them a new name and made them his witnesses in the earth. In order to maintain their integrity toward Jehovah these witnesses, otherwise called “the remnant”, must now go forth and bear testimony to earth’s rulers and to the people that Jehovah is God, and that his kingdom is at hand, and that the kingdom is the remedy for suffering humankind.

<p><span class="font5">This shows that Jehovah would use the members of the elect on earth for a specific purpose during the time of tribulation, and this honor he gives to none other. The ‘shortened days of tribulation’ must take place while some of the elect arc yet on the earth, for the witness work they do by the Lord’s grace must be done on earth before the final end. Therefore Jesus said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations' and then shall the end come.” The good news to all lovers of righteousness is that Satan’s rule has come to an end, that Jehovah’s kingdom, which will vindicate his name, is here; that Christ has been placed upon the throne, and that all must know that Jehovah alone is the Almighty God.

Within a short time he will take these faithful ones into their everlasting inheritance, and these are informed that before receiving that inheritance they must fight faithfully and truly under the name and banner of the eternal King. The assembling of the tribes before Moses seems to have a correspondency in the sealing of the tribes of Israel, as stated in Revelation 7. Jehovah’s covenant people are now before him to hear all that he might say unto them by Christ Jesus, and then to render full and loving obedience to his commandment.

The others well picture the elements that make up “organized Christianity” which opposes those who boldly proclaim Jehovah’s name. The avowed purpose of the combine is to cut the remnant (who claim to be and are now a nation) off from being a nation. The conspirators say in effect: “We will set up the kingdom for ourselves, and we will rule the world.” At their head is Gog, and back of him is Satan, who says: ‘The world is mine; I have made it for myself.’ The conspiracy and all the conspirators are anti-Jehovah and against his kingdom. They are therefore against Jehovah’s witnesses Jehovah says to the enemy: “I am against you.” Therefore the issue is squarely drawn, and the day of battle is near.

He is the “beginning of the creation of God” and has always been the delight of Jehovah because always with him. He is the one that leads the creation of God in the way of righteousness By the exercise of his mind the beloved Son of God ascertained Jehovah’s will, and then with delight proceeded to act accordingly. “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 8) The chief purpose of Christ Jesus at all times has been to make known to others the righteousness and glorious name of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s anointed therefore must fully trust him and fearlessly declare his name. The time approaches now when Jehovah will give opportunity to the people to determine in whom they will trust and whom they will serve. Because he has made Christ Jesus his vindicator Jehovah now speaks to his great Servant and Witness (Isa. 42- 5-7) He does not say that Christ Jesus is commissioned to take the people to heaven, but does say that he is commissioned to open their blind eyes and inform them of the truth, that they may have an opportunity to choose whom they will serve. Those who believe on the name of Christ Jesus, the great Redeemer and Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, have reason for a hope. Every one who maintains his integrity toward God, to that extent, therefore, will prove Satan to be a liar and hence will have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font5">The facts show that the murmurers or complainers have become blind to the truth in recent years. The eye of the true servant of Jehovah is single in its purpose. The servant’s eye is blind to all things save only one, and that one the doing of Jehovah’s will for the vindication of his name: “Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant?” (Isa. 42: 19) The laborer in Jehovah’s vineyard who murmurs has a selfish heart and a selfish desire to be honored above others. This proves that the ones who murmur must have been defiled. One who is defiled and remains in that condition could not be of Jehovah’s temple or sanctuary class.

At the time of his ascension to heaven angels from heaven stood by and said to the disciples: “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. ’ ’ Thereafter the apostles earnestly and with anxiety looked forward to Christ’s coming and admonished their brethren so to do. The Scriptures assure the faithful that for them there is in heaven an inheritance incorruptible awaiting them, but do not say that the faithful are going to heaven to meet the Lord.

Then was set up the royal court of Christ Jesus: “And again, when he [Jehovah] bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world [in 1914], he [Jehovah] saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.” (Heb. 1: 6) Then followed the awakening or resurrection of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who had died and who must await God’s due time.

<p><span class="font5">The wholesale slaughter of human creatures stopped with the end of the World War. Neither Satan nor any of his worldly organization had anything to do with causing it to cease; but the sorrows upon the world that began in 1914 continued. Since then the Devil by and through his organization has continued to harass the people in his endeavor to turn them against Jehovah. Jehovah God exercised his power and authority to stop the World War. Satan never would have stopped it, because his purpose was to destroy the human race; but that destruction would have brought no honor to Jehovah nor a vindication of his name. A work having to do with vindicating Jehovah’s name must be done before the end of the great tribulation which would result in the destruction of Satan’s organization.

Jona-dab rode with Jehu in his chariot to observe his zeal for Jehovah, foreshadowing how the Jonadab class now join Jehovah’s organization and thus identify themselves as being on the Lord’s side. Jonadab was not an Israelite. He was a Rechabite of the Kenites of the tribe of Midian, which Kenites entered Canaan with the Israelites. To them the Devil worship was offensive. They showed much more zeal and faith in God than many professed Israelites did. This foreshadowed that at present people of good will have more faith in God than the professed ones in the so-called Christian organization. The faithfulness and devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses in delivering the testimony concerning the kingdom is partly for the benefit of the Jonadab class, and these should be invited to join in proclaiming the name of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/33</span></p>

Note that the record is that the first time he “took” his hand out of his bosom, but the second time Moses “plucked” it out, which latter action indicates that he did so quickly and with energy and with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house.

Satan piled persecutions upon Jesus in an effort to prove his side of the question at issue and to prevent Jesus’ giving testimony concerning God and his kingdom. Amidst great sufferings Jesus continued to the end to bear testimony to the truth and to maintain his integrity and to thus prove God to be true. The remnant now on earth must likewise suffer at Satan’s hands because they are bearing the testimony of Christ Jesus the great King. At the same time they must maintain their integrity by learning obedience by the things they must suffer. But there is a real joy in tribulation when we know that it is because of doing right and if we continue faithful unto the end we shall prove our integrity and thus have a part in vindicating Jehovah’s name.

This should no more be permitted than to permit love for any other creature to stand in the way of service to Jehovah. The true disciple of Jesus Christ must take the same course that Jesus took as a man, which was unqualified devotion to the Almighty God. “He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. ’ ’ There can be no words of qualification added to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> when applied to Jehovah.

Let all those who have responded to the call for the kingdom give thanks and rejoice that they are now favored with the great opportunity of knowing Jehovah and having the privilege of being his witnesses and thus have some part in the vindication of his name.

(Isa. 40: 17) “None can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?’’ (Dan. 4: 35) The time has come now to settle the issue before all creation that Jehovah is supreme, that he is the King of Eternity, and the One who shall rule the earth and make it a place of righteousness, and this fact the great Prophet and King, Christ Jesus, will make known to the peoples of earth. Satan and his wicked organization must go and Jehovah God by his righteous King “shall reign for ever and ever’’. Let the proclamation be sounded throughout all the earth, that Jehovah’s Vindicator will not back down, but will march on to victory, continuing to exhibit the mighty works of the Most High God.

<p><span class="font5">It is the meeting with the Lord that is here emphasized by the apostle. Manifestly it is at the time of the gathering of the Lord’s own to the temple that he assigns to such the crown here mentioned by the apostle. This is assigned before the faithful ones go to heaven, because Jesus said to them: “Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.” (Rev. 3: 11) It is those who love the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, says the apostle, to whom the crowns are assigned. These show their love by joyfully obeying the Lord, and they unselfishly devote themselves to his service. If then they continue faithful unto death they receive the great reward of immortality.—Rev. 2: 8-11. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">What is the chief test that is applied to everyone called to the kingdom? The Scriptural answer is, Love for Jehovah God is first, and second is love for the members of his household. (Matt. 22: 36-40) Love is the complete unselfish devotion of the creature to the great Creator, Jehovah God. One who loves God delights to keep his commandments and is looking, not for some honor to be bestowed upon the creature, but for the opportunity to prove his integrity and full devotion to God and thus have participation in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. All in line for the kingdom and who really love God have but one prime objective: to have a part in vindicating Jehovah’s name and to be to his glory. What more could one desire on earth than to have Jehovah say to him, in substance: Because of your unselfish devotion to me and my kingdom I bestow upon you the honor of bearing my name as my witness?

<p><span class="font5">The faithful remnant are no longer in the dark as to the will of God. They are made a part of the host of Jehovah under the Greater Moses, and must hearken unto his every word and joyfully obey. (Deut. 18:18) As Moses said to the Israelites in Moab, so now the Greater Moses says to the eovenant people in the temple: “See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.” If the remnant would live they must now continue uncompromisingly against the enemy organization and wholly and completely devote themselves to Jehovah and his organization Into their mouths Jehovah has put his word, and as members of his organization they must finish the testimony of Jesus Christ committed to them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of thee.—Ps. 17:15, Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures more often apply the word “awake” to those who are in the Lord’s favor, enjoying the measure of life, yet who are inactive and need to be stirred up. Undoubtedly this text applies to the members of God’s organization upon the coming of Christ to the temple and the building up of Zion. It is then that the Lord covers these faithful with the robe of righteousness and clothes them with the garments of salvation, identifying them as members of Jehovah’s organization. When they were awakened and learned that the Lord Jesus was at the temple and that they were gathered unto him there and had the privilege of sharing in vindicating Jehovah’s name, they became satisfied and continue to be satisfied to do whatsoever the Head of the temple commands, realizing now that they must be faithful unto death.

<p><span class="font5">The “dry land’’ represents the consecrated people and those order-loving people on earth who have a sincere desire to see righteousness established amongst men. Jehovah first showed his anointed people that commerce is the mainstay of Satan’s visible organization. This he did that his people might be strong in faith and active in proclaiming the truth against that part of the enemy organization. This proves that Jehovah’s witnesses must pour the truth upon the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“dry </span><span class="font5">land”, and must do so in the presence and hearing of Satan’s representatives that all may have an opportunity to know that Jehovah is God.

<p><span class="font5">Probably many of the faithful will be killed because they continue to faithfully proclaim the truth they have learned in the secret place of the Most High. Jesus, of course, foreknew these facts, and the inference to be drawn from his words is that some of the faithful will be killed. Satan and his agents can kill Jehovah’s witnesses, and they are trying to do so, but they cannot destroy the very existence of these faithful ones. Only Jehovah’s Great Executioner can do that. The question is put squarely up to the remnant: Shall we fear man or fear Jehovah God? It is written, in Proverbs 29: 25: “The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” The fear of man will certainly bring the remnant into a snare.

It is certain that the cleansing of the temple, which is the house of God, began when Christ Jesus appeared at the temple and began judgment. The time must come when all who used the temple or organization of God to accomplish any selfish or personal service for personal gain must be gathered out, because the sanctuary class must be clean at the end of the fixed time so that a positive righteous offering of sacrifice and praise might be presented to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">Before leaving his disciples Jesus emphasized one great truth that they continually kept in mind, and that truth was concerning his return or second coming. Jesus did not say he would prepare a place and then send for his faithful followers, but he said, “I will come again and receive you unto myself.” The apostle John wrote later: “And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming ” Surely no one will be ashamed at the time he participates in the first resurrection, but there is a possibility of some to be ashamed at the time of the coming of the Lord to the temple, and the facts show that some were ashamed and are still ashamed.

<p><span class="font5">That must mean that the remnant is threatened with destruction and that Jehovah protects them by his almighty power and so informs them at this time that they may be fully assured of safety. It is Scriptural that those who hate Jehovah’s witnesses hate Jehovah in fact and are therefore God’s enemies. Jehovah enlightens his remnant, and in so doing he discloses to them his enemies and at the same time shows the remnant how they are related to the honor of his name. The well-being and preservation of the remnant because of their faithfulness and obedience and devotion to God will have to do with the vindication of his name. It will prove that Jehovah can put creatures on earth who will be faithful to him under stress and maintain their integrity toward him, and that he preserves those who truly love him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Paying the laborers at the end of the day, or A.D. 1931, would not mean there was no more work to be performed or that the work in Jehovah’s vineyard had come to an end. Rather does it show that those who receive their wages with gladness and appreciation are the ones to whom from that time on the Lord assigns the work of finishing the testimony and doing the work from then till and at the battle of Armageddon. All hire that was paid was and is a gracious gift bestowed by the Great Householder upon those who had rendered service in his vineyard. This hire or wage is paid while the workers are on earth, and not after they get into heaven.

Murmuring against the work which Jehovah approves is murmuring against Jehovah himself. God turns the mur-murers away from him and casts them out.

The casting down must necessarily refer to the faithful members of Christ’s body while on the earth, because there could be no such thing as casting down Jehovah’s organization from heaven.

<p><span class="font5">What God has been doing during the waiting period is “to take out of the nations a people for his name”. This people taken out and approved by Jehovah must bear his name. Since Jehovah confers this honor on none aside from his anointed, it follows that all thus taken out must follow the Lord Jesus not only for a time, but to the end, and that they must prove their integrity, must become members of God’s organization of which the anointed Jesus is the Head and must bear testimony to Jehovah’s name faithfully unto the end. To take men and women to heaven would be no honor to Jehovah’s name, but to select out from amongst fallen men 144,000 who would prove their integrity and unswerving devotion to Jehovah God even unto death is a vindication of his name, because such proves the Devil’s challenge is false.

Laborers are always glad to see pay-time arrive. One day’s work was done, and now they would have their wages and have a season of celebration and then go on to another day with greater zeal for their work. It was even so with the laborers appreciating their position in the Lord’s vineyard, in 1931. A time of special rejoicing came because the Lord of the vineyard was paying his laborers.

Manifestly one who desires to please God and at the same time to please and receive the approval of man. No man can serve two masters, and no man can receive the approval of the world and at the same time have God’s approval. If he seeks the honor of men he is God’s enemy. Christ Jesus had nothing to do with the world and did not receive honor of men. To be spiritually minded means to walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus.

(1 Cor. 11:3) Therefore the “heads” of Jehovah’s covenant people are Jehovah himself and the Lord Jesus Christ. At what time, then, were these “heads of the people” gathered together?

All the suffering that has been upon the world is due to transgression, and particularly to Satan’s wickedness, and the suffering of the people has resulted as a natural sequence to wrongdoing. Jehovah has no pleasure in the wicked. He is angry with the wicked at all times (Ps. 7:11), but he awaits his own good time to act against the wicked, and when he does act it is for the vindication of his own Word and name.

No one can obtain everlasting life except through Jehovah, and they must believe on the name of Christ Jesus and obey him, in order to receive life, because Jehovah has made this provision.

He tells them what they must do, and therefore they are not to look to some of their brethren to instruct them what to do. If you are one of the remnant and in the temple the instruction from the Head of the temple class is plain and clear.

The entire world is now in turmoil and distress and has nothing in which it can hope so far as the world’s schemes are concerned; but to those who desire to know God and his King the information is now given that “in his name shall the nations hope”. As Jonadab was brought into close contact with Jehu, so now the sheep class is brought into close contact with the bearers of this divine message of peace. In order for the Jonadab class to hear, someone must tell them of the King’s proclamation; and this privilege is assigned to the faithful remnant. —Rom. 10: 14,15.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A root of all the vices is the love of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim 6:10, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All religious organizations of the world are commercial; for all such organizations are created and carried on for the personal gain of Satan and his dupes and to turn the people away from Jehovah God. Beginning on the plains of Shinar Satan organized a religion the express purpose of which was selfish gain to Satan and to the people and for the turning of man away from God. The religion of the world is commercial for the reason that it is a primary means employed by Satan to traffic in human flesh and blood. Selfishness, or love for self and self-gain, led the people at Shinar into Satan’s trap. From then till now every religion of the world, regardless of the name of it, has been organized and carried forward for the selfish gain of creatures, therefore all such religions are commercial. This is proof that “the love of money” or selfish gain is the root of all evil. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the heavens do rule.—Dan. 4: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This proves that the stump must have a close relationship to the kingdom of Christ. In Nebuchadnezzar's dream the leaving of the stump in the ground, •which represents the human part of the original organization, would picture Jehovah’s purpose to make provision for the redemption and final deliverance of the obedient ones of mankind and that these may grow up into another organization and live forever. Beyond all doubt the “tree in the midst of the earth” which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream pictures Satan’s organization which must perish for ever, and then Jehovah causes a new tree to grow up which is his capital and righteous organization. Christ Jesus is the Head and Overlord thereof. Therefore the hope of man, who was a part of the original tree, is in the new tree. Christ Jesus is the tree of hope. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The mind of humankind is set upon doing the things of this world, by supporting the religious systems and being a part of the political and commercial element that rule and control the world, all of which are under Satan and against God. Such worldly creatures laud and praise men and exalt men and tell of the great achievements of men, but they do not honor Jehovah’s name. If a man who has made a covenant to do God’s will fails or refuses to obey the commandments of Jehovah in order that he may thus save himself from the criticism or persecution of the world, then he is a follower after the flesh and is carnally minded and against God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">It is the name of Jehovah that must now be exalted and placed where it belongs, that all may know who is supreme. Therefore the safety of the remnant could be nowhere else than in the name of Jehovah. For the remnant to now fail or refuse to proclaim the great name of Jehovah would mean that they would lose all protection and quickly fall at the hands of the enemy. Jehovah God is the true Friend of his &quot;servant” class, and the &quot;servant” class must remain true and steadfast to Jehovah if the &quot;servant” would live.

Likewise men once in the position of elective elders but no longer put in such position by votes, being placed on a common level with even the latest one coming to the truth, are offended and lodge complaint because of what they claim to be unfair treatment of themselves. No longer given a preferential claim to express their own personal views, they are chagrined and say in substance: ‘Behold, those who have been in the truth only a short while are made our equals, and that is not fair.’ They are not satisfied to see that God has brought all into an equal condition and has given all such a like part in the vindication of his name.

<p><span class="font5">The “evil servant” class will continue, by using what appear to be “good words and fair speeches”, to try to induce the faithful to enter their own assemblies and will then resort to subtle means to turn the faithful away from God’s organization. The wicked one is a subtle foe, and the “man of sin” is of the wicked one; hence he is wicked. These contemptuously say to the faithful: “You are engaged in a bookselling scheme. Why not come with us and enjoy sweet fellowship?” To give heed to such speech would drive one away from God and his organization. Such danger lurks in the pathway of the remnant; hence the Lord by his prophet gives to the remnant this prayer: “Let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.” They must remember always that Jehovah preserves only those who love him.

<p><span class="font5">This shows that while mankind is alienated from God, out in the world with no proper habitation, yet God would not permit the race to perish and become entirely hopeless, but that it should be kept wet with the dew from heaven, the refreshing promises which could be laid hold upon by those who love God and righteousness. As Deuteronomy 32: 2 declares: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew.” This refreshing coming from heaven would work beneficially to those humans who during that long period of waiting would have and exercise faith in God and his promises and endeavor to maintain integrity toward him.

Jehovah sent him to bear His message of truth to the people, and now Jehovah sends his witnesses to bear a like message to “Christendom’’. When Ezekiel went to Jerusalem the Jews blustered and bluffed and tried to frighten him, just as the clergy and their allies now attempt to do with Jehovah’s faithful witnesses.

<p><span class="font5">It cannot be said positively why the Lord permitted the thought of ‘going to heaven’ to have the chief place in the mind of so many of his people, but we do know that the Lord permits men to exercise their own free will. If one has a selfish motive in understanding the truth of God’s Word it is likely he will fall into error. Jesus and the apostles stressed the importance of love for God, which means an unselfish devotion to Jehovah; yet many deemed it of greatest importance to get themselves ready to go to heaven rather than to show their love for God. It may be asked: Does error or misconception matter much, as long as one is honest and does the best he knows how? Does it affect one seriously? It certainly does! Sincerity and honesty in following an error does not build one up. It is the truth that sanctifies. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The League of Nations was set up by the Anglo-American empire system. It was earlier than that, to wit, 1918, that Jehovah’s sanctuary class or devoted people were “cast down” and the “continual sacrifice” of service was taken away. In May, 1926, a convention of Jehovah’s people assembled in London, England, at which time a resolution was adopted: “A Testimony to the Rulers of the World.” This testimony was notice served upon the seventh-world-power rulers, setting forth that the League of Nations is not the expression of God’s kingdom on earth. That fixes the time of the beginning of “the transgression of desolation”, because from that time the rulers had notice in their own place of operation. The 2,300 days count from then.

Its trunk is cut off and severed from the earth; the stump is left in the earth and dies, but some of the tender roots survive and reach out for the water, and these are revived and an entirely new tree grows up and is more beautiful than the original or first tree. A tree is symbolic of a living creation or organization, the stump of which particularly pictures the earthly or visible part of that organization. The stump of the original tree, representing man, and the roots thereof in the earth have waxed old, and yet there have been some men, pictured by the roots, that have scented the truth, reached out for it and clung to Jehovah and his precious promises, and these have promise and hope of being brought into the new “tree”.

He knew there were many people on earth who claimed to be Christ’s followers and some who sincerely followed Him and maintained their integrity toward God. Now his purpose was to destroy the nations, and particularly those called &quot;Christendom”, rather than to see Jesus rule over them. For this reason Satan plunged the nations into the World War.

Mordecai and Esther confessed to being Judeans, i.e., those who praise Jehovah, and likewise those who are now rightfully bearing Jehovah’s name confess to being Judeans. Magnifying and vindicating Jehovah’s name is the primary thing to be done by those called to share in the kingdom work.

The great battle about to be fought is called ‘the battle of God Almighty’ because then is when he will take a hand. In Revelation 19: 11-16 a vision is given of Christ Jesus ready for the battle of the great day, supported by his hosts of holy angels, and riding a white horse, thus symbolically saying that his cause is a righteous one and ‘in righteousness he goes forth to make war’. Only the members of Jehovah’s organization will follow the great leader in that war, and the part to be performed by the remnant on earth is to sing Jehovah’s praises.

The beginning of the counting of the “seven times” must wait until the overturning of Israel’s last king, Zede-kiah, in 606 B.C. From that time the scripture applies: “It shall be no more, until he come whose right it is” to have the kingdom and rulership of the world. At Zedekiah’s overthrow this decree against Israel was entered and there it was that Satan became the god of the whole world. Then and there the seven times began to count; meaning that God would not interfere with the beastly rule of earth until the end of that specific period of time.

It is God’s ‘elect servant’ that is here mentioned, and that servant is blind to everything of the world, has nothing whatsoever to do with it, but is against it; and that servant is wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, hence is of singleness of devotion. The same thought was expressed by the apostle when he said: “This one thing I do.” Those who are of the remnant class now have their affections set upon Jehovah and his kingdom, and upon nothing else. Their devotion is entirely thereto. Being of the servant, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, these have the mind of Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">From and after the Lord’s coming to the temple there were those in line for the kingdom who became wise in their own conceits, self-centered, rebellious and lawless. The words “thick” and “fatness” mean “to shine and become gross”. There are those who have a great desire to shine before men and such have become unfaithful to the terms of their covenant. They become lawless or workers of iniquity and refuse to give heed to God’s way of carrying forward his work and instead follow their own selfish ways. It is this class that makes up the “evil servant”, the “man of sin” “the son of perdition.” The great Rock is Jehovah, and the “evil servant” class, “the son of perdition,” disregards the instructions given by Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giv-eth it to whomsoever he will.—Dan. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words “kingdom of men” do not refer to the petty kingdoms of Satan’s wicked world, but to the kingdom or invisible lordship set up over man. The fact that Satan has been permitted to continue to exercise overlordship of man is no contradiction of this. He has so exercised rulership, not because his power was superior to Jehovah’s, nor because he is higher than Jehovah, but because Jehovah has suffered it to be so. In his own due time he delegates this power of rulership to whomsoever he pleases, and he makes known now that he has given it to Christ Jesus and that he will associate with Jesus 144,000 others, his true and faithful footstep followers, who maintain their integrity to the end.

<p><span class="font5">For the creature to ignore the Creator and pursue a course that he hopes will bring him personal gain means to pursue an evil course. That which lies at the root of all evil and evil results to those who have once started in the way of serving God is the “love of money’’, the desire for selfish gain regardless of what that gain may be. If the truth finds a man with the obligation of supporting his family by engaging in some commercial pursuit, he is justified in remaining therein provided he can do no better to make provision of the things decent and honest for his dependent ones. But if the Lord provides for him and those dependent upon him and at the same time puts him in a position of service to the Lord, then faithfulness to God would mean that he must remain steadfastly in the Lord’s service and not take a contrary course to satisfy some selfish desire.

The whole matter reverts to the great issue before all creation, to wit, Who is the Most High? Long ago Satan raised that issue. Now it must be settled because it is God’s due time Knowing this fact the faithful witnesses of Jehovah pray for the execution of his judgment. Jehovah will not destroy his enemies to gratify a grudge, as many have taught. All of Jehovah’s judgments are just and right, and in him there is no unrighteousness at all. He will destroy all his enemies for the best interests of righteousness, because the universe could not be clean until they are gone. The wicked would never go voluntarily; therefore God must destroy them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">No one can faithfully and diligently obey the commandments of God at this time and at the same time “lead a quiet and peaceable life’’. (1 Tim. 2: 1,2) It is a fight from henceforth. The remnant cannot be faithful in delivering the testimony at places of opposition and at the same time lead a peaceable and quiet life. The temple class is being prepared for war, and their peace and quietness come not from earthly rulers, but from Jehovah God. They are at rest, but their rest is in the Lord, while they are fighting for that which is right. (Isa. 26: 2-4) Those who are in the temple, and hence on the side of Jehovah, willingly and joyfully sing his praises as they march forth to the war. They are good and faithful soldiers following the lead of Christ Jesus, the great Field Marshal. They do not look for peace and quietness at the hands of those who rule Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Like King Nebuchadnezzar, mankind was cut off from the princedom of earth and was put out of God’s organization, lost his true manhood and became brutish, which qualities have been specifically exhibited by earth’s rulers. Also the overlord, Lucifer, was cut off from Jehovah’s organization and became as a serpent and dragon and wild beast, “seeking whom he may devour.’’ The execution of the divine decree against Satan and his organization was suspended until 1914, the end of which time is definitely marked by the “seven times”. As Nebuchadnezzar was made to eat grass like oxen, so mankind has fed upon what the beastly rulers have served up to them. Only those who have diligently sought the Lord God through Christ have fed on the promises of God’s Word. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/34</span></p>

So the last shall he first, and the first last —Matt. 20:14,16. </span><span class="font5">The ones last called to the kingdom and who enter the vineyard service are to be found joyfully taking their place in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, and these are spoken of as the last that shall be first. This does not have the effect to puff them up, but they appreciate the loving-kindness of our God in giving them an opportunity to prove their integrity toward him and have some part in vindicating his name. They had to wait only a very short time to receive their wages, the “penny”, because they were only a short time in the vineyard service. They showed their appreciation of God’s goodness by gladly responding and continuing to sing forth his praises. Jehovah will have a cleansed and faithful sanctuary class to bear the fruits of his kingdom in this hour of great stress. Giving to his people the “new name” and bringing it to their attention has served to do this very cleansing work, shaking out the selfish.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">To he spiritually minded is life and peace —Rom. 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be “spiritually minded” the mind of the creature must be diligent in ascertaining God’s will, be set upon doing and maintaining an unbending determination to do the will of the Great Spirit, and then do it regardless of what any creature might think or say. The mind of the creature is that faculty with which God has endowed him for searching out the truth and reaching a conclusion thereupon, which conclusion leads him to act. The will is the fixed determination of the man to act and which is reached by the exercise of his thoughts. Having his mind set on ascertaining God’s will, and having an unbending determination to do that will when ascertained, he never willingly deviates therefrom. Paul wrote his brethren that the reasonable service of the follower of Christ Jesus is to devote himself wholly to God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the “last trumpet” because it announces the beginning of the reign of Christ Jesus, “whose right it is” to rule and who shall rule thereafter, and never again will there be a king installed in office, and hence no occasion for sounding another trumpet. Never again will there be need for vindicating Jehovah’s name and never again will there be another war and victory, because this shall be the last and righteousness will continue for ever under God and Christ. The “trumpet of God”, the “last trumpet”, began to sound when Jesus went forth to begin his reign in 1914, and must continue to sound until the organization of Satan is destroyed, the name of Jehovah vindicated, and complete victory given to Christ Jesus at Armageddon. Within this period of time the resurrection of the faithful dead and the gathering of the remnant to the temple take place. W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. — Dan. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus, although the beloved Son of Jehovah, must suffer humiliation in order to prove Jehovah’s side of the question at issue and to demonstrate his own qualification to become Jehovah’s Vindicator. Jesus was meek and lowly. He made himself of no reputation and humbled himself even unto an ignominious death, and was therefore brought low. Therefore it pleased Jehovah to set up over the kingdom or rulership of men “the basest [the low One] of men”. (Phil. 2: 7-11) Jehovah thus fixes the qualification of the One to whom he gives the kingdom. Those associated with Christ Jesus in the kingdom must possess similar qualifications and hence these are the low ones of earth whom the Lord uses for his purposes. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The remnant who meet together in their closets to study the Word of God there ascertain fully what they are to do, and such is the truth revealed to them through the temple; and then it is their duty to be obedient to the Lord’s commandments and make these truths known to others, as witnesses of Jehovah. The Lord with his angels is at the temple, and those who fail or refuse to be obedient to his commandments are denying the Lord before his angels and before men. The Lord lays the obligation upon the remnant class at the temple and emphasizes it when he says: “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God; but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">By his “hand”, Christ Jesus, Jehovah now sends forth his witnesses to bear testimony before the peoples and to serve notice upon the rulers that the time has come for God’s people to go to the mount of God, that is, to the kingdom, and to give their allegiance to Jehovah; and to tell them that God’s kingdom is the only hope for the world, and that Satan and his organization must cease to hold the people in subjection and bondage. When Jehovah turned the waters of the Nile into blood, that was notice to Pharaoh, and hence notice to Satan and his organization, that commerce is done for, and is as good as dead. Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to testify of Jehovah unlil every part of Satan’s organization shall go down. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/33</span></p>

The overlordship of earth (pictured by the tree) is changed, but this change does not take place until the end of the “seven times’’, which occurred in 1914, at which time Jehovah placed his Son upon his holy hill of Zion and sent him forth to rule. This proves that the great ‘ ‘ tree in the midst of the earth’’ as seen in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (Dan. 4: 10-18) is Satan and his organization over men, and that Jehovah’s capital organization is Christ Jesus and those under him, and that such is the new tree or organization in which the nations must hope.

The apostle refers to the faithful remnant on earth when he writes; “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him”; which gathering is to the temple. Being thus gathered they “meet the Lord in the air”, that is, in the condition which is not discernible by natural sight. If gathered to the temple, then certainly they are with the Lord and have been awakened and know of his presence with them at the temple; and therefore these faithful ones have a spiritual vision of his likeness, his face or similitude.—Ps. 17:15. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/34</span></p>

These self-constituted earthly rulers utterly ignore God’s Word, and they are as nothing. It was God’s will that the rebel army should be ousted from heaven, and this was promptly done by Christ Jesus. It is his will that Satan’s organisation be blotted out of existence. It is Jehovah’s will to destroy all earthly ruling factors forming a part of Satan’s organization, and in all these things his will shall be done. He will spare only those of good will and shield them in the time of the great battle.

<p><span class="font5">At the temple the remnant ‘have a vision of the Lord’s face’, because they discern his presence with the anointed. Concerning Moses it is written: “With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold.” (Num. 12:8) There is no evidence that Moses saw with his natural eyes the face of Jehovah when God spoke to him “mouth to mouth, even apparently”, but Moses knew of Jehovah’s presence, and ‘the similitude of the Lord he beheld’. Moses as a type of Christ includes at times the remnant as members of the body of Christ. Therefore there seems to be a direct connection between the scriptures as to God’s speaking to Moses face to face and the faithful remnant’s beholding the face or presence of the Lord after being clothed with the robe of righteousness at the temple.

Jehovah will have a sanctuary class which is entirely clean and free from selfish ambition. The cleansing thereof includes the removing from it of all who selfishly desire to have a position of honor or office that might enable them to shine among men. Such cleansing or separating work has been done by and since the adoption of the “new name’’ resolution.

This is the honor or glory which none other is permitted to have. As Christ Jesus is the great witness of Jehovah, likewise all those who are brought into unity with him and upon whom the new name is bestowed must be witnesses to the name of God and Christ. Hence Jehovah says to them: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God,’ that is to say, the Supreme One, besides whom there is no other.

Nebuchadnezzar boasted, Satan made the similar boast concerning the world organization, that it was his own. The proud of heart are abominable in God’s sight. Hence the kingdom was taken from Nebuchadnezzar, even as the right of overlordship departed from Lucifer at the time of his rebellion, and man was then and there moved out from under the protection of the “higher powers” of Jehovah’s organization; and since then only those of mankind who have maintained their integrity toward Jehovah have had his favor. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/34</span></p>

The work in his vineyard is not completed because now the parable of the penny is fulfilled. On the contrary, those who joyfully receive the “new name” find much work to do, and this they do with a glad heart. To such faithful ones the understanding of the parable is a comfort and encouragement because they are enabled to see more elearly that if they would maintain integrity towards Jehovah and ultimately share with Christ in kingdom glory they must be faithful and true in bearing the fruits of Jehovah to the honor of his name. Those who make the proper use of the penny, the new name, and do it faithfully and without murmuring, are the ones that will continue on Mount Zion with Christ Jesus.

No human organization has any right or authority to censor or stop the proclamation of that message, and those who do so will do so at their own perik W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Until two thousand and three hundred eveningmornings, then shall the sanctuary he vindicated.—Dan. 8:14, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This means vindication and victory for the right. It proves that the remnant takes a positive and unequivocal position on Jehovah’s side and is wholly devoted to him and his kingdom and is thus proved right. Jehovah would permit no one to be of that class who is in any wise out of harmony with the kingdom and its work. The Lord told Daniel that at the time of the end “many shall be purified, and made white, and tried”. (Dan. 12:10) This corresponds exactly with Christ Jesus’ coming to the temple for judgment in 1918. That marks the beginning of the separating work, or the beginning of the cleansing of the temple. The cleansing of the sanctuary class must be completed twenty-three hundred days after “the transgression of desolation”, beginning May 25, 1926, and not 2,300 days after judgment begins. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.—Deut. 33: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this emphatic declaration from the mouth of Almighty God ringing in their ears, who among the remnant should fear any part of Satan’s organization? Those who do fear men or devils will fall into a snare, but those who confidently trust in God shall not be moved. Jehovah’s precious promise to bear up his people with his everlasting arms has never applied until the gathering of his approved ones into the temple. These are made a part of Jehovah’s host under Christ that goes into battle, and before which mighty host the enemy is certain to fall. Jehovah now gives full assurance that he will thrust out the enemy and destroy him, and he commands his covenant people to sing out this great truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/33</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">December 31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">At the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me; and 1 blessed the Most High; and 1 praised and honoured him that liveth for ever.—Dan. 4: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nebuchadnezzar’s reason having returned, he now pictures regal power as exercised by Christ Jesus. The time had come for the inauguration of earth’s rightful King as ruler, and as such he is pictured by one acknowledging and extolling the name of Jehovah and declaring Him to be the Supreme One, besides whom there is no other. The proclamation with which the fourth chapter of Daniel opens was issued by the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses on earth are the ones privileged to give publication to this proclamation among the people. Therefore, Nebuchadnezzar’s giving the proclamation pictures regal power exercised by Christ, the King of kings, filled with understanding and the spirit of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font7">“WHO SHALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HIMSELF TO THE BATTLE?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—1 Cor. 14:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">' | “'HAT question, the apostle Paul’s, is nineteen hundred </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> years old. Why, then, raise the question now? Because it was written expressly for this end of the age. Preparation for the battle of battles is feverishly in progress and will soon reach a climax at Armageddon. The trumpets of world rulers, leaders and religionists are giving an uncertain sound; they clash discordantly. To which should you give ear to prepare yourself to line up on the right side, the winning side, the side of truth, safety, security, and divine protection and preservation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The only trumpet of certain sound is that of Jehovah’s living Word, written by inspiration for our sure guidance in this the world’s supreme crisis. Only a few books today faithfully sound the message of the &quot;sure word of prophecy”; these books are the works of Judge Butherford. Realizing from that prophetic Word, as no other man shows himself to do, that Armageddon is unescapable and very near, he has written the books listed below, that people of good will may prepare themselves and take their stand on Jehovah’s side: thus “it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger”.—Zeph. 2: 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE Devil knows he has but that much time to get ready for the final battle, Armageddon. (Revelation 12:12) That means there’s not much time left for any of us to prepare for the coming of that decisive battle, which means vindication for Jehovah’s name, destruction for Satan and his organization, and deliverance for the people of good will on earth.</span></p>
