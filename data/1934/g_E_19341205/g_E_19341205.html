<p><span class="font5">Broadcast over network on Atlantic coast, from WBBR, Sunday, November 18, 1934, by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">L</span><span class="font8">IBERTY of conscience, and freedom of speech and press, have ever been dear to the hearts of the true men of America. Love for those principles moved the men of the early days to build this nation. Today there is an organized and subtle movement to take away from the American people liberty of conscience and freedom of speech. The prime agency of that unrighteous movement operates from its headquarters in a foreign land. Already many Americans have fallen into its subtle snare.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">In the early part of this year a petition signed by approximately two and one-half million American citizens was presented to the Congress, demanding that affirmative action be taken to prevent selfish organizations from interfering with the rights of the people in hearing what they desire to hear by means of radio. That was the greatest petition ever presented to Congress up to that time. A law was enacted creating the Federal Communications Commission, one section of which instructs that Commission to hear evidence concerning the radio broadcasting methods and to report to the Congress not later than February 1935. Such hearing of testimony before that Commission was had in the month of October this year, and the official record thereof is now at Washington. The members of Congress are the servants of the people, and now the people are entitled to know what is contained in that official record, in order that they may instruct their congressmen at the next session thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses offered testimony before that Commission, which testimony constitutes a part of that official record. My speech on this occasion is to enable the people to gain some information concerning the situation, and therefore I shall quote from the official record. The substance of this testimony will be printed in booklet form and millions of copies thereof will be distributed a-mongst the people within a short time. If you desire a copy, write the station to which you are listening or to Watch Tower, Brooklyn, and you will receive a copy without charge. At their own expense Jehovah’s witnesses are now bringing this program to you that you may get some of the truth of this matter.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>A Radio Station Against Free Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One radio station* in this chain has threatened to cut off the program if any statement is made by the speaker which it would seem to that station should not be heard by the people. If that station does cut off the program, that will be evidence of an effort to suppress the truth. I shall say nothing about any person on this </span><span class="font5">Just as this leaves our hands a cable comes from Hemery and Burton, London, England: ‘ ‘ Thrilling reception Pittsburgh broadcast.” (Reception from W8XK, Pittsburgh.) </span><span class="font8">occasion except what appears in the official record at Washington; and all of such record the people have a right to hear. The two major broadcasting corporations in America could broadcast to you all of that record with very small expense; and they should do so, but they will not. That may be considered as circumstantial evidence that they do not wish the people to hear all the truth that is in that record.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">131</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Because this matter involves the right of the people to speak and to hear the truth, and hence is of such vital importance, you should write your congressman, demanding that the entire official record of the aforesaid hearing before the Communications Commission, Broadcast Division, be printed at the expense of the government and freely distributed to the people. You are entitled to know the facts which your congressmen have required the Commission to report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The aforementioned petition presented to Congress early in the year charges that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">National Broadcasting Co.,</span><span class="font8"> the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Columbia Broadcasting System,</span><span class="font8"> and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman Catholic Hierarchy,</span><span class="font8"> and others, have wrongfully, by threats, coercion and other improper influence, prevented many stations from broadcasting certain programs, thus depriving the stations of legitimate income and depriving millions of citizens of the privilege of hearing what they wish to hear. The evidence offered in support of those charges shows not only that said two major chain-broadcasting companies refuse to permit their facilities to be hired and used by Jehovah’s witnesses, but that they attempt to prevent other radio stations not owned by them from accepting and broadcasting such programs. The evidence also shows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has, during the past year, carried on a campaign of coercion by means of threats of boycott to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from using radio stations for broadcasting and have tried to induce many radio stations to refuse to broadcast programs offered to them in a legitimate way. Representatives of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in giving testimony before the Congressional Committee charged that the aforesaid petition was obtained by fraud. From the official record I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In keeping with Satan’s methods of false representations the statement has been made and widely published by certain religious papers that the names signed to that petition were obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. I here brand that statement as a deliberate and infamous lie, which has been published for the purpose of prejudicing this Commission and the Congress. The petition was plainly printed, submitted to the people, and was voluntarily signed by those persons who did sign it.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>People Should Be Free to Hear</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The official record shows that the programs which are broadcast by Jehovah’s witnesses are called Watch Tower programs and are devoted to explanations of the Bible concerning God’s kingdom on earth about which all the prophets foretold and for which Christ Jesus instructed His followers to constantly pray, and which kingdom is the only hope for distressed humanity; that Jehovah’s witnesses do not desire controversies with anyone, hut they are earnestly endeavoring to give information to the people concerning God’s kingdom because of its importance to them; that Satan the Devil is the great adversary of God and of His kingdom, and that such adversary uses selfish men whom he blinds to suppress the truth and to keep the people in ignorance thereof; that the people should be free to hear the message concerning God’s kingdom and then determine for themselves what is for their own best interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The law governing broadcasting emphasizes the fact that radio stations must broadcast programs of public interest, convenience and necessity. The words </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">interest, convenience</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">necessity</span><span class="font8"> should be clearly defined, and the definitions thereof should be according to the highest authority. The presumption must be indulged that Congress used the words according to the definitions based upon the highest authority.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Claims to Be a Christian Nation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this connection attention is called to the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Church </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">vs.</span><span class="font8"> United States, 143 U.S. 457, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer, affirmatively held that the United States is a Christian nation. The highest courts of practically all of the states have followed that decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. No lawmaking body of the United States could now be heard to say that the United States is not a Christian nation whether that claim is absolutely true or not. That decision means that the government recognizes Christ Jesus as the Master Teacher and Jehovah the Most High the supreme authority. Christ Jesus taught only the words of Jehovah God. Therefore the law of God as set forth in the inspired Scriptures takes precedence over man’s law, because God is supreme. We therefore ask the Commission and Congress to give due and careful consideration to the definitions of the foregoing important words according to the meaning placed upon them by the supreme authority. The proper definition of these words will aid in determining the value of the testimony offered at this hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Interest.</span><span class="font8"> According to the derivation of the word, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">interest</span><span class="font8"> means that which commands attention because of its importance and value. It does not mean merely that which entertains, but means that which is for the good or profit of those who hear it or receive it. Necessarily it follows, that which is of public interest is that which relates to man’s peace, prosperity, happiness and his life. Since all these desirable things proceed from Jehovah God, that which is of public interest is Jehovah God’s provision for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Convenience</span><span class="font8"> means that which is necessary, proper, profitable and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">for the</span><span class="font8"> building up or improvement mentally, morally, spiritually and materially of the people. At Proverbs 30: 8 the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">convenience</span><span class="font8"> is used in this manner: “Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me.” The original word from which the English word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">convenient</span><span class="font8"> is there derived means, “That which is good, righteous, and well for my person.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Necessity</span><span class="font8"> means that which is needful to meet a condition that exists. Where one is in stress or under constraint </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">necessity</span><span class="font8"> is that which meets his demands for his well-being or betterment, and hence is profitable to him.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Interest, Convenience, and Necessity</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foregoing definitions, based on the highest authority, therefore show that programs broadcast should be for the upbuilding of the public in things which they need, mentally, morally and spiritually, and which would advance them in the way of righteousness and best equip them to meet their life battles. It necessarily follows then that nothing could be of such public convenience, interest and necessity as that which is contained in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is written (2 Timothy 3:16,17, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.): </span><span class="font8">“Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness: that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the foregoing definitions of the words </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">public interest, convenience</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">necessity </span><span class="font8">there are very few programs that are broadcast in the United States that meet the requirements of the law. It is certain that the programs broadcast by Jehovah’s witnesses come nearer meeting the legal requirements than any other, for the reason that a large portion of these programs are based upon and fully supported by the inspired Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Further the official record says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Throughout the earth there is great opposition to the message delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses concerning the kingdom of God. This Commission and Congress arc entitled to know the reason therefor. Satan’s method of opposition is to deceive and thereby blind men to the truth and cause them to vigorously oppose the truth. Satan’s chief instrument used for this wrongful purpose is the religious organizations, their leaders and their allies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy used threats and coercion, expressed through various newspapers and other publications, to compel many station owners and managers to discontinue broadcasting Watch Tower programs of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Copies of such publications containing threats of boycott by agents of the Catholic Hierarchy were freely used in many parts of the country to coerce owners and managers of broadcasting stations and allied business enterprises. Such action was taken to enforce pressure upon those stations by means of organized letter-writing and personal visits of individuals and groups spurred to act by direction of the Roman Catholic clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a result of the nation-wide opposition conducted by the organized clergy and the subsequent action of members of the Federal Radio Commission in writing officially and specifically to hundreds of radio stations regarding the Watch Tower programs, many radio stations, induced by fear of losing their license, have broken their contracts with Jehovah’s witnesses and decline to further broadcast their programs until the matter shall be definitely settled by Congress or its duly constituted authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The official record of the Congressional hearing, which purported to show the methods of operation between the Catholic Hierarchy and its connection with the Federal Radio Commission to prevent radio stations from broadcasting Watch Tower programs, was mutilated, which mutilation tended to destroy the value of that testimony. The fact of the mutilation is not disputed. The question is, Who would be interested in destroying the record showing those connected with the Catholic Hierarchy in their campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The two major radio corporations have joined hands with the clergy not only to censor programs, but to prevent such programs’ being broadcast which might disturb the religious doctrines long held by some others, even though those doctrines are utterly erroneous. They have created what they call ‘The National Church of the Air’, and limited all religious broadcasting to Catholics and Protestants, recognized clergymen, and refuse to hire their facilities to anyone who tells the people what the Bible says on vital questions of the hour. A few men have assumed to tell the people what they may or may not hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Objections to programs of Jehovah’s witnesses are that their programs attack other religions or other persons. That charge is not supported by the facts or the evidence submitted. Before the Commission Mr. Bellows, for opponents, testified:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I do not believe it is legitimate to hold the things that are dear to other people, things that they care about, things that men cherish in their hearts, up to public ridicule.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a statement is broadcast, and which statement is fully supported by the Word of Jehovah God, that statement is not an attack upon men of the clergy profession even though such statement of truth makes the doctrines held dear by the clergy to appear ridiculous in the eyes of other persons. A statement of truth, fully supported by the Word of God, is of the greatest public interest, convenience and necessity, even though such truth holds up some men to ridicule and contempt. On this point the scripture says (Romans 3:4): ‘Let God be true though it make all men liars.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">People Entitled to Learn</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religionists have, for more than a hundred years, held to doctrines which are clearly contrary to God’s Word. If in the present time there is an advancement in the understanding of God’s Word, then the people are entitled to hear it; but if private corporations are permitted to determine that only those who advocate the ancient doctrines should be heard, then the people are prevented from hearing discussed that which is of interest, convenience and necessity to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As an illustration, the orthodox doctrine of both Catholics and Protestants is that when a man dies he is not in fact dead, but that he has an immortal soul that keeps on living and if that person was wicked his soul is in purgatory or hell torment. The orthodox doctrine is that persons in purgatory, undergoing punishment, may have the duration of punishment lessened by the prayers of men who are living and who are practicing the Catholic religion. The Bible, on the contrary, teaches that all who die are in the grave awaiting resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the dead are not in purgatory but are in the grave, then certainly no man, regardless of whether he is a priest or holds any other position, could pray him out of purgatory or lessen his punishment in purgatory, and anyone who would teach the people that this could be done, and would take money therefor, would be taking money under false pretenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Shocked Susceptibilities” vs. Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do this Commission and Congress wish to hold that repeating the plain statement of God’s Word on this subject shall be construed as an attack on religionists? Will this Commission and Congress conclude that the broadcasting corporation systems and the Catholic Hierarchy are justified in having these divine truths excluded from the people merely because the truths themselves “shock the religious susceptibilities” of some persons? If so, is this regulatory power of the broadcasting facilities being exercised in harmony with the spirit and intent of the Congressional mandate? Manifestly it is these plain Bible truths, clearly stated and broadcast for the benefit of the common people that they might hear and understand, to which our opponents object, because these truths expose errors of long standing, which errors are ‘cherished in the hearts’ of some persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If our opponents’ contention is correct, then it is more important to let the people go blindly on in the dark and not know of God’s gracious provision for them than it is to tell the truth which might disturb some time-worn doctrine that is ‘held dear to the hearts’ of some persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight with men, and whether any group of men is well thought of or little thought of is not material as far as this Commission is concerned.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Time-worn, Illogical Nonsense</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the light of the proper definition of public interest, convenience, and necessity, is it fitting and for the best interests of the people to know the truth as set forth in God’s Word, or to hold to the time-worn traditions of men which are ‘cherished by some persons’? Such doctrines of men as are mentioned above, and which are contradicted by the Scriptures, are not of public interest, convenience and necessity, in this, that they do not tend to the betterment of the people; but the truth of God’s Word is of public interest, convenience and necessity, for this reason, that it not only tends to lead but actually leads them into the light, builds them up materially, morally and spiritually, and shows them the way to eternal life. Here the words of Jesus are appropriate (John 17:3): “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How can the people know these truths unless somebody tells them? and if our opponents are permitted to prevent the people from hearing, then Congress is permitting them to use the radio facilities against public interest, convenience and necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even though Jehovah’s witnesses collectively may be in the minority when compared with the group of Catholics, Protestants, Jews and others named as our opponents, yet two and a half million American citizens have petitioned Congress that they might be privileged to hear the programs of Jehovah’s witnesses, which they declare are of aid, comfort, benefit, interest, convenience and necessity to them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Dare Congress Deprive Millions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will Congress permit our opponents to deprive these millions of persons of the privilege and liberty of exercising their God-given rights and duties of proclaiming the truth in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment merely because the proclamation of such divine truths “shocks the susceptibilities” of some who hold time-worn doctrines ‘dear to their hearts’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Congress permits this condition to persist and continue, then our forefathers labored in vain to lay the foundations of the nation as a place of freedom to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of one’s conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will this Commission and Congress desire to go on record as holding that if the unvarnished truth upsets some old and cherished doctrine the truth should therefore not be told lest it disturb the sensibilities of those holding such doctrines ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shall we assume that Congress meant that programs should be broadcast truly for the public interest, convenience and necessity, or that they be broadcast to please the sensibilities of a few individuals or corporations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This matter is squarely before this Commission, and will be before Congress. The lawmaking body must determine whether a few men will be permitted to set themselves up as duly qualified to edit and select programs and determine what the people shall or shall not hear and thereby appoint themselves as the mental and spiritual guardians of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shall the people have a free and open forum to discuss and hear discussed vital questions and to determine for themselves what is for their welfare, or shall America continue to be a paternalism?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Thing Desired to Be Covered</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Would it not be more appropriate to follow the principles originally adopted by this nation, to allow every man freedom of conscience and freedom of speech? Also to follow the admonition of the great Teacher, Christ Jesus, to wit (Matthew 23:8, 9): “But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this Twentieth Century of enlightenment, does it not seem that the American people are so advanced in knowledge and education that they need no company of men to pose as or act as their “fathers”? This is not said to hold up men to ridicule, but because it is the plain unvarnished truth. The American people are entitled to know the truth.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark35">1</a></sup> Paternalism is foreign to American principles.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Where the Washington (D.C.) Station Faded Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mere fact that a plain statement of the truth as set forth in God’s Word “shocks the religious susceptibilities” of some and appears to a few men as an attack upon “the religious convictions of millions of radio listeners” is no reason whatsoever why that truth should be withheld from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A most atrocious crime is committed in the land which shocks the susceptibilities of all order-loving persons. Yet these chain-broadcasting systems do not hesitate to broadcast the details of that atrocious crime. If the theory that they have adopted with reference to “religious” broadcasts is correct, then nothing should be published that might shock someone else, regardless of how true it .is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Truth is eternal, and always bears the closest scrutiny and investigation, and could never be shaken or disturbed by any statement that any person or organization might make. Teachings of orthodox religion, ‘cherished’ in the hearts of some men, have endured only a few centuries, and now in the light of God’s Word it appears that those things so held are erroneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The truth of Jehovah endureth for ever.” (Psalm 117: 2, XR.U.) Shall the eternal truth of God’s Word be denied to the people merely because the light from that Word plainly shows that previous doctrines might be disturbed? Of the two, which is of public interest, convenience and necessity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A reference to the definition of these words hereinbefore set out will at once demonstrate that the truth, and the truth only, is of public interest, convenience and necessity. Error could never free anyone. It was the great Teacher, Christ Jesus, who declared (John 8: 31, 32): “If ye continue in my word ... ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all the programs broadcast by Jehovah’s witnesses, not one person has been called by name and held up to ridicule. The record will bear out conclusively the truthfulness of this statement.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The truth which the great Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, has caused to be published and preserved for the benefit of the human race is of such paramount importance to all things else that it should have the widest publication of anything, particularly among the people who claim to constitute a Christian nation. To maintain the claim and past reputation of this nation the solemn duty devolves upon Congress to enact necessary laws to prevent all interference with the open, free and wide publication by radio, and by all other means, of the truths set forth in the Word of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By taking the side of those who oppose the message of God’s Word, all so doing align themselves with the Devil. By opening the way for free, unhindered discussion and consideration of the truth of God’s Word, those who so do, to that extent, place themselves on the side of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is written (Romans 6:16): We are the servants of him whom you serve.’ Let the Congress of the United States now choose to declare which side they take and whom they desire to serve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">ESTIMONY offered in form of affidavit by Anton Koerber before the Communications Commission charges the Roman Catholic hierarchy with mutilating and destroying certain evidence presented before Congress by Jehovah’s witnesses. “Father” Harney, of the Paul-ist Fathers, considering himself implicated, rushes into print stating that he never asked to see the evidence which was mutilated. Nicely stated, isn’t it? Here is something else not so nicely stated. In St Peter’s Roman Catholic church, New Brunswick, N.J., there was placed in the box the question: “Does the Roman Catholic church regard Protestants as heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even unto death, if necessary?” It was answered by the “Reverend Father” Harney, of the Paulist Fathers, as follows: “In a way I say Yes. Certainly the Church does consider Protestants as heretics, in a way. A formal heretic is one who knows he is perverting the truth of God and the Roman Catholic church. No one, by sinning himself, should be allowed to lead others into sin. I do not doubt, if they were</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*T'HB Paulin Fathers, while conducting a mission in St. / X Peter's Roman Catholic Church, in New Bruns' wick, N. J., in May, 1901, had as one of the features a question box. One Friday night the following question was found therein:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2^**'Doos the Roman Catholic Church regard Protestants ** as heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even unto death, if necessary ? &quot;&nbsp;It was answered by Rev. Harney as follows&quot;In a way</span></p>

A formal heretic is one who knows he is perverting the truth of God and the Roman Catholic Church. No one, by sinning himself, should be allowed to lead others into sin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“ I do not doubt, if they were strong enough,! that the Catholic people would hinder, even unto | death, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> necessary, the spread of heresy (such I errors), through the people, and I say rightly so.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; As human society protects itself against the murderer { and the man who proves to be a traitor to the Government, I so the Church of God has a right to protect itself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Sunday following this meeting, a reporter for the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> interviewed the priest and in that interview Father Harney stated that his remarks on the Friday evening, as given above, were correct. He said they expressed his personal convictions, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and were in accord with those of the Roman Catholic Church.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Washington Fe</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Evening Forum, May, 1934. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">~ Father D. J. Phelan, editor of the St. Louis </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Western Watchman,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> was received in special audience by the Pope in 1905 and 1913. Said this celibate in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchman: &quot;We </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">would like to rack and quarter Protestantism; we would like to impale it and hang it up for crows to build nests of; we would like to tear it with pincers and pierce it with red-hot irons; we would like to fill it with molten lead and plunge it into hell fire a hundred fathoms deep,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The only true Church” is quite as offensive in this Pro* testant country as it is abroad. Father H. Lester, SJ.» wrote as follows in the Pope-blessed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Universe of</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9th March, 1923: “We have said before and we say it again — Protestantism isn't a religion, it is a disease. The Church has to deal with those affected with the disease as a physician deals with a case of smallpox, or a dentist with a decayed tooth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Cardinal Bourne, the Pope’s chief representative in the British Isles, took a solemn oath (printed in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> of 1st December, 1911), in which he promised “to combat with every effort heretics and schismatics and those rebelling against our Lord the Pope and his successors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Public men, ignorant of Rome’s uncharitable speech and action, sometimes patronize Papal functions. The Chnrch of Rome teaches plainly that the Protestant Churches are “from the father of lies and therefore displeasing to the God of truth.'' They little know the sort of thing they are helping on—a grossly intolerant and offensive foreign system — “the Italian Mission” (to use the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Church Times'</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> description).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us hope that a perusal of the Bureau’s tracts will open the eyes of the offending public men and women (Rome vilifies the fair sex. See the Bureau’s Tract No. 4) —* and that in future they will have nothing whatever to do with what Charles Dickens (no bigot) rightly described as the “most horrible means of political and social degradation left in the world,” and John Ruskin as &quot;the most debasing and degrading of all creeds,” while that great Roman Catholic authority, Cardinal Newman, simply stated the truth when he confessed that “the Catholic Church is encumbered with its connection with moribund nations.” Let </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">that suffice I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Published</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> by the Protestant Press Barna (A. Leveque, Sec.), Word, King,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fP.T.O.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">strong enough, that the Catholic people would hinder, even unto death, if necessary, the spread of heresy (such errors), through the people, and I say rightly so. As human society protects itself against the murderer and the man who proves to be a traitor to the Government, so the Church of God has a right to protect itself.” On the Sunday following this meeting, this would-be murderer stated that his remarks on the Friday evening, as given above, were correct. He said they expressed his personal convictions, and were in accord with those of the Roman Catholic church. We need only add that any man who would murder would commit any other crime whatever, including mutilation of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Harney’s Amusing Denial</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font8">EWSPAPERS in New York, Philadelphia, New Haven, New Britain, and all over the country, have printed the Associated Press dispatch from Washington reiterating Judge Rutherford’s charge before the Communications Commission that agents of the Catholic hierarchy mutilated the record of Congressional radio hearings, thus destroying certain evidence. Hardly had these dispatches, dated October 4 and 5, been sent out over the country than other dispatches, dated October 8, also went out from Washington stating that “Father” John B. Harney, of New York, superior general of the Paulist Fathers, denied before the Communications Commission that he had asked to see the official record of radio hearings before a House committee last spring. Now just why “Reverend” Harney should rush into the case is for him to say. Seems as if it would be a good idea for the whole Catholic hierarchy, from the pope down, to make similar statements, equally truthful, and then the only unpleasant, stubborn fact remaining will be that the records were mutilated while in the hands of agents of the Cath-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This was the statement made by the Rev. Mr. Harney, a Paulist Father in St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church, in New Brunswick, N. J„ Friday evening. The Paulist Fathers have been conducting a mission for the&lt;-last three weeks in that church. Last week the services were for the benefit of non-Catho-lics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A feature of last week’s service* was a &quot;question box.&quot; This question was read by Father Harney on Friday night:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Does the Catholic Church regard Protestants as heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even with death if necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Father Harney’s answer was:—</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Paulist Fathers, while conducting a mission in St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church, in New Brunswick, N. J., had as one of the features a question box. One Friday night the following question was found therein:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Does the Roman Catholic Church regard Protestants as heretics, and does it not believe and teach that heretics should be punished, even unto death, if necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It was answered by Rev. Harney (present head of the Paulist Fathers, 415 West 59th Street, New York City), as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“In </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">way, I say yes. Certainly the church does consider Protestants as heretics, in a way. A formal heretic is one who knows he is perverting the truths of God, and the Roman Catholic Church. No one, by sinning himself, should be allowed to lead others to sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“I do not doubt, if they were strong enough, that the Catholic people would hinder, even unto death, if necessary, the spread of heresy (such errors), through the people, and I say rightly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“As human society protects itself against the murderer and the man who proves to be a traitor to the Government, so the Church of God has a right to protect itself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Sunday following this meeting, a reporter, for the New York Herald, interviewed the priest and in that interview Father Harney stated that his remarks on Friday evening, as given above, were correct. He said they expressed his personal convictions, and were in accord with those </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy plead, with crocodile tears, that the broadcasting of the truth of God’s Word, the Bible, might “offend the religious susceptibilities” of some listeners; and that therefore such broadcasting, meaning particularly Watch Tower programs, ought to be strictly prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the same time, is it any wonder that the susceptibilities of order-loving persons in every part of the land, who desire to know the truth, are ‘shocked’ and ‘offended’ when they are arbitrarily deprived of the opportunity to listen peacefully at home to broadcasting of the refreshing message of the true God, JEHOVAH, as that message is expressed by Him in the prophecies of His Word (the Bible) and as now being given to the people of this nation by Judge Rutherford and others of JEHOVAH’S witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the millions who are so ‘offended’ and ‘shocked’ is a listener in Virginia who has just written to Judge Rutherford. His letter, reproduced in full below, beautifully portrays the attitude of the two-and-a-half million who </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">protested</span><span class="font8"> to Congress last January against the atrocious practices of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the National Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting System, and others, in depriving Americans of the privilege of hearing Watch Tower programs, and whose PROTEST stands to this day unanswered. And here is Mr. Turner’s letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">c/o Watchtower, Brooklyn, N. Y. My dear Friend :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your talk of Sunday, November 18 (A.M.), from WCAU as regards the interference of the Roman Catholic clergymen with Watchtower broadcasts prompts me to write this letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">am not, never have</span><span class="font6"> been, neither will I ever be a member of any church, for the simple reason that their dogmas, doctrines, long-faced and impious moneygrabbing ways, and their hell torment and other ignominious twistings of the pure and simple laws of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Whose “Religious Susceptibilities” does this expressed desire to commit murder offend?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Almighty God and the teachings of Jesus Christ, nauseate me, and deepen my disgust of them daily, especially the Roman Catholic churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Watchtower broadcasts of the past two years have given me the utmost joy, and increased my belief in Jehovah God and the Bible, beyond measure. What a pleasure to hear the plain truth in plain words! No Romish priest with clothes the color of the rainbow, calling some man his holy father, and bowing down to his wood and stone image-saints!! No preacher with his collar turned backwards, and his belly filled, telling the poor to give their hard-earned money to the church, and just believe, then they shall be saved from eternal torment!!! No wonder the world is in such a turmoil, but I can see peace ahead, thanks to the truths of the Bible as shown by the Watchtower broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following words are taken from a letter written by me and addressed to the president of the National Broadcasting Company, dated October 22, 1934. Up to this present moment I have received no answer, although I specifically asked for one, which seems to prove, to me at least, that ‘ ‘ silence may be golden, but it can also be an admission of guilt ’ Quote letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">President N. B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New York, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">May I as one of the N. B. C. ’s most consistent supporters and enthusiastic listeners take just a moment of your time for a bit of constructive criticism in regard to one of your Sunday afternoon programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The N. B. C. ’s policy, I believe, is to give to its listeners an unbiased and non-partial review of such public problems relating to politics, economics, religion, etc., both pro and con. I am therefore writing in a spirit of helpfulness, I hope, as regards N. B. C. ’s treatment of Sunday religious programs. I am not a member of any church, therefore I trust that what I am writing will not be taken as being for the benefit of either the Roman Catholics or the Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your Sunday (P.M.) program (of the past few weeks), called the ‘ ‘ Catholic Hour ’ ’, seems and in reality is so obviously one-sided in the matter of religion that I am beginning to doubt very seriously the N. B. C. ’s non-partiality. I hope, however, that I am wrong in this conjecture, but it is impossible even for your most casual or non-partisan listeners to class this particular program as anything except partiality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Permit me to call to your attention the non-denominational and independent broadcasts of the “Watchtower Bible Society”, of Brooklyn, N.Y. You will find, I’m positive, millions of N. B. C. listeners, getting, as I do, much pleasure and comfort out of these (Watch Tower) broadcasts; at the same time becoming puzzled as to the N. B. C. ’s—shall I say, ‘ ‘ lack of cooperation,” i.e., not giving to a large portion of its audience that which they enjoy, namely, the Watchtower broadcasts. Why not give them a ‘ ‘ spot ’ ’ along with the others (religions) on Sunday afternoons? It is my honest belief that in doing so you will be doing a distinct public service, at the same time proving N. B. C. ’s non-biased and non-partial attitude, which, I’m sure, it is in reality. Hoping for an early reply, etc. Unquote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have quoted this letter to N.B.C., thinking that perhaps it may be of some slight interest in showing how the Watch Tower programs are appreciated. Trusting that I have not taken up too much of your time, and hoping that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty Himself</span><span class="font6"> will open the way for a greater number of people to hear the truth, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ADDRESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Diet a Simple Science </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By H. Sillaway (Tennessee)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE greatest difficulty in establishing a truth is in divesting it of the complexities we erect around it in its uncovering. The fallen human mind worships mystery and rejects simplicity. Dietetic truth is no exception to this rule, and no subject has ever experienced a worse maze of conflicting theory. There is little wonder that the average individual is perplexed. How can we expect people to take a subject seriously that not only is crisscrossed by and enveloped in theories that contradict one another in practically all essentials, but also creates tables, rules and regulations that are over the head of the average individual’s ability to comprehend and harmoniously apply ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, after all, diet is a very simple science. Does it look reasonable that the all-wise Creator has made man’s dietetic needs a matter of complex scientific study requiring years of more than average intelligence to get back of? Just a little common sense is all that is needed to answer this question. Our foreparents in Eden did not have to take a long course in dietetics to learn what to eat and how to eat it. They were told the foods they were to eat, and that was all there was to it. They were endowed by their Creator with the sense or instinct of food selection in proper variety and balance, and this was their unerring guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But mankind in general have long been on an off diet, and have formed perverted appetites, and some study and a lot of common sense are needed to get back on the right track. With most of us in the past it has taken years of experience in wading through theories and fads to arrive at the simple truths that common sense should have taught us at the start. But just ordinary, everyday common sense has little scientific ring to it; and because of that fact the majority of investigators of this subject are lured to the fads and theories with which it is beset, and each adds his own bit of theory to the mountain of mixed truth and rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, after all, that is fallen man’s roundabout way of getting at the truth, and the truth results though it takes a lot of sifting to get it. After years of this sifting of dietetic theory no small part of it is found to be rubbish. Another element of it is scientific truth that is of special value to the dietitian and scientific anthority, but of minor importance to the ordinary individual at the present time, who merely wants to know what and how to eat to maintain health. To such we trust the following pointers on diet and the pitfalls of theory will be of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While diet is one of the chief essentials to health, it is not the only one, by any means, and too much should not be expected of diet alone. Some authorities tell us that good health must and will result from the use of a proper diet where sufficient vigorous daily exercise is taken. But this is not always true; for many have not the constitutional foundation for perfect health, and the daily vocations of others are either of a character not healthful in themselves or are under conditions that cause nerve tension, mental depression or too great mental or physical strain. Again, many are subject to unavoidable worry which renders perfect health impossible. But whatever the handicap may be, diet is a long step towards health, and for that reason aione proper dietetic rules should be observed as far as reasonably possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">People suffering from subglandular weaknesses, as many of us do, cannot expect full vibrant health to result from diet; for no system of diet yet inaugurated has had the miraculous power to develop constitutionally undeveloped glands. But, on the other hand, there is no class of people to whom a proper nourishing diet is more necessary for the maintenance of even a measure of health than the subglandular one. But through recent scientific discoveries there is a ray of hope ahead for this class of sufferers. In subglandular troubles, especially of the thyroid and adrenal glands, a lack of magnetic nerve force results, which in turn results in an improper atomic arrangement of the iron in the blood. To the extent that this exists, to that extent the iron is deprived of its oxygencarrying nature, which appears to be the principal office of the iron in the system. The result of an improper functioning of this iron as an oxygen carrier leads to oxygen starvation of the tissue cells, which is the direct cause of much disease and weaknesses among subglandular sufferers. It ha-s been found that by placing the patient inside a magnetic field for a few minutes once to three times daily the atomic state of the iron in the blood is corrected and the glands stimulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tables of food values in their nutrient essentials are a valuable study in the selection of the necessary variety in the menu. But this very study often proves the very reverse of what it should, as more often its influence is towards faddism and theorism detrimental to sound dietetic rules. More often proper dietetic habits are better established by not giving these tables too serious consideration and by following simple rules, such as are here given, in food selection. After dietetic habits are once established on a sound basis a deeper study of the scientific principles involved will not endanger one so much to unsound theorism, and will be an aid in correcting minor irregularities in dietetic rules that have escaped our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wild birds and animals in their normal state are not subject to disease, because they live a natural life and eat what they should. Their food is selected through the food selection instinct with which the great Creator has endowed them. Man is subject to disease because he does not lead a natural life and either ignores the food selection instinct with which he is endowed or, through circumstances, is unable to use it. Perverted appetites have had the influence to crowd out his inherent sense of food balance and food selection. This sense is the only real guide we have for a proper and harmonious food selection, and for that reason it is necessary that we redeem it by a study and correction of our perverted appetites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These perverted appetites are our tastes or preferences for all kinds of improper and demineralized foods, as pork products, corn syrups, white-flour bread, white rice, potatoes peeled before cooking, etc., and also the extensive use of high flavorings, spices and condiments, tea and coffee, all of which create false appetites and render our sense of food balance and selection more or less useless. Even a light use of any of the above-noted products is often sufficient to seriously interfere with a proper functioning of our food selectivity instincts, and the failure to realize these can always be traced to indulgence in some of our old perverted tastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having rid ourselves of our perverted appetites we are now in a proper state for our food selectivity instincts to begin to function as our guide in what to eat and in the quantity of each kind of food to eat at each meal. And rest assured they will do it after a little rigid training, and far more nearly perfectly than can be done by the unnatural methods so widely advocated. For a time we shall be troubled by temporary returns of our old perverted appetites. These we must train ourselves to recognize. Remember, too, that our guiding senses in food selection will function only when we are really hungry. A strong desire for sweets at the beginning of a meal usually denotes a slight digestive derangement, and it further denotes that we are not really hungry, however faint at the stomach we may feel; for, normally, such a desire for sweets does not manifest itself, if at all, until the keen edge of hunger has been satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, the reader is wondering what this sense of food selection that we are discussing is and how recognized. But, after all, there is nothing at all mysterious about it, any more than there is about hunger, of which it is an accompaniment and to which it is directly related. When we sit down at the table we often see some article or articles of food upon it that we like, and though we are hungry these particular foods do not appeal to our appetite at this particular meal. This is nothing more nor less than the discriminating call of our system for the foods in their combination of nutritive elements which it needs at that meal. In other words, it is our instinct or sense of food balance' and selection in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have always possessed this sense, but if in the past our diet has been an improper one, its functions have been perverted; and because of this perversion some authorities fail to recognize the original office of it, and think it necessary to figure out a table of the average proportionate amount of each nutritive element the system requires daily, and urge that we see to it that our daily diet contains these in something near that proportion. But here are the facts of the matter: The depletion in the system of the various nutritive elements which our food supplies varies greatly in time. Some meals or days we may not require any of some nutritive elements as available in some particular combination found in a certain food or foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that divine providence has provided such a wide range of food products gives us a lot of material for thought. We have all noticed that when restricted to a diet limited in variety, some foods, which at the beginning were keenly relished, finally lose their savor to our appetites and oftentimes even become loathsome. The reason for this is that the system has been oversupplied with the nutritive elements in the combination in which they exist in this particular food, while, on the other hand, it has starved for the want of the nutritive balancing combinations found in certain other foods that sometimes may not even differ radically in chemical analysis. Food chemistry is not even yet the perfectly understood science we are often led to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that nature has provided such a great variety of food products is in itself proof that perfect health demands that they be used in as much variety as is reasonably possible. When possible, quite a range in variety should be on the table at each meal; for in no other way can a diet be provided in a harmonious balance for each member of the family. This gives each an opportunity to select the foods that the appetite calls for. A food that is but poorly relished is nothing more than an imposition against nature, and no matter how rich it may be in its nutritive elements the system will derive but indifferent benefit from its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All foods should be prepared in an appetizing form in which the natural flavor of the food itself predominates. For this reason high seasoning and flavoring should be avoided with all foods except, perhaps, an occasional desert. Black pepper should be eliminated, as not only is its use detrimental to health, but also its influence is towards a perversion of the food selectivity instincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The housewife should acquaint herself with a table of food values in their component nutritive elements, so that in the selection of the menu a complete range of these will be represented in the foods selected. In this selection natural food products which in their analysis show a low nutritive value in their constituent properties should not be discriminated against, as their lack in this respect is usually made up for by other health qualities. Nor should this selection favor foods only of high vitamin analysis. To do so means not only a limited variety, but also the cutting out of some of the most healthful of our food products. It is indeed a question if these vitamins are not produced in the digestive processes through the solvent chemical action of certain mineral food elements when combined with their solvent affinities in proper food combinations. The decided vitalizing effects of such combinations as have been noted, when used by those of sensitive organisms, very strongly indicate this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of the solvent principles involved in proper food combinations such combinations should be followed in the diet. This will be done naturally if we let our natural instincts guide us in food selection. We instinctively use fats with proteins, sugars with acid fruits when used with other foods, acid fruits with meats, etc. But if we restrict variety too much in our meals we miss more or less of these vitalizing combinations. We regret space does not permit taking up this important phase of diet in this treatise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our diet should contain plenty of roughage, and more raw foods should be used than ordinarily are. The menu should also contain an abundance of fruits and vegetables, as these are indispensable to health. Practically all kinds of fruit are healthful. The prejudice voiced by some health authorities against strong acid fruits is based on mistaken theory. And the same is true in the prejudice against bananas, which is based on the fact that bananas are cut green.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bananas cannot well be transported in a ripened state, but divine providence has provided for this by storing up in the thick cluster stem of the fruit sufficient nutriment in advance to thoroughly ripen the fruit after cutting; and bananas pulled from the stem green will not ripen naturally. Bananas are among our most useful table fruits, and many even with weak digestion can use them with impunity in any stage of ripening.</span></p>

Wholesale prices of commodities are the highest in three years. This is, no doubt, a good thing for “business”, but it is probably not so good for the consumer. Wages have not increased appreciably, if at all.</span></p>

The health authorities do not know what causes cancer, and never will. Why should they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FOURTEENTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">in the series of short lectures on the Bible specially prepared by Judge Rutherford is presented herewith. The emphasis which the Bible places upon an understanding and appreciation of the truth should lead every reasonable person to a diligent effort to obtain the treasure. In the brief lecture herewith Judge Rutherford shows how one 'may obtain the truth, and what obstacles are put in the way of those who are earnestly seeking for the truth.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Truth</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE truth is not what man may think, believe and teach, but the truth is what is contained in the Word of God as set forth in the Scriptures, or Bible. Concerning Jehovah it is written, at John 17:17: “Thy word is truth.” Why? Because Jehovah is the Creator of heaven and earth, the source of life, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift. His Word of truth is man’s only safe guide, as it is written, in Psalm 119:105: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Religion is not synonymous with truth, because religion consists of forms of worship and the doctrines of men. There are many religions, and none of them are wholly devoted to God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible discloses the purpose of the Almighty Creator toward His creatures. It plainly teaches the origin of man, tells why men become sick and die, why there is so much woe and suffering on earth, and what will bring about the end of all wickedness and unhappiness, and what is the hope of the peoples of earth. These things are particularly necessary to know in these times of great distress. No one can possibly know the truth without having some knowledge of Jehovah and His purpose as set forth in the Bible; and for that reason a knowledge and understanding of the Bible is of greatest importance to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man’s worst enemy is the Devil. His name </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Satan</span><span class="font8"> means that he is the opposer of God. The purpose of Satan is to keep men entirely in the dark and ignorant of the truth in order that they may not find the way to God, life and happiness. These facts are plainly written in the Scriptures. It is the will of God that men learn the truth, that they may then be free to follow whatsoever course they may desire. Satan’s purpose is to prevent men from learning the truth. If there is an organization of men that keeps the people in ignorance of the Bible, it necessarily follows that such organization is serving Satan and is against God and His kingdom; and this is true regardless of what the men in these organizations may claim. The indisputable history of the Catholic hierarchy is that that organization has kept the people from studying the Bible. That is the best evidence that the Catholic hierarchy is serving Satan and not Jehovah, and hence is an unsafe guide for the people. The Catholic hierarchy has been and is chiefly interested in having the people pay into its coffers their hard-earned money and for which they get no valuable return. The word of truth is free, and no one has a right to commercialize anything in the name of God and Christ. These things are not said to offend the sensibilities of anyone, but that the people may see that their only hope is to know God’s truth and obey it; and they can know it only by gaining a knowledge of what is in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the religious organizations of this world have agreed that they will say nothing about each other’s doctrines that might cause offense. That sounds nice, but it is really a trick of the Devil to keep the people in the dark. Such a course is out of harmony with God’s Word, because it is written in the Scriptures: ‘Let the truth be declared though it make all men liars.’ (Romans three) No one who desires to do right can become offended at the truth. If you are in the dark and going the wrong way and someone shows you the light and points out the right way, you are not offended, but you are glad. We are now in the last days, meaning the last days of Satan’s false and fraudulent rule. We are near the time when God’s kingdom under Christ shall rule the people in righteousness. It is therefore God’s time and His will that the people shall have opportunity to learn the truth. To that end God has brought about facts in fulfilment of His prophecy to enable us to see what these present-day events mean. He has caused books to be published setting forth these facts alongside of His Word of truth as contained in the Bible, and these books are now available that the people may teach themselves. Of course, we must expect the Devil and all of his agents to oppose the circulation of these books; but let the people determine for themselves whether they want to longer be deceived or whether they want to know the truth. Jesus declared: “The truth shall make you free.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N A LETTER to a friend a German seafaring man says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I came home [------, Germany] just on Sunday,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">October 7, when all the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, at direction of Brother Rutherford, met together and at this occasion sent a letter to the German government, informing them, etc. . . . Our joy was great, and the result was that now many- brethren again systematically go from door to door with the Bible in their hand and deliver an oral testimony. Even those brethren who have hesitated so far to do this seem to overcome their reluctance and to realize that they have wrongfully permitted other brethren to restrain them from doing service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yesterday [October 19], before we left port in ------, the service leader of the company there came on board and asked me to inform you that the last two days the authorities in Germany began new violent persecutions. They search the homes and seize the literature in possession of the friends which they owned for their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">private</span><span class="font6"> use. The local authorities do this against the instruction from the Ministry of the Interior, who has sent (September 17 of this year) an order to governments of the individual states of Germany to return all our confiscated literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The fight starts again at all fronts; but Jehovah’s witnesses are marching joyfully forward, knowing that the critical hour is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Germany is feverishly preparing for Armageddon. You understand. [War preparations] Most of the people observe the development of the things with fear and terror and are sensing how dark and threatening the near future is. We find the people in Germany everywhere with hearts full of horror, and Jehovah’s witnesses find many open ears. The people are seized by a general restlessness, and the fury of war is heard approaching through the air.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dortmund, Germany, Nov. 14.—“Our Fuehrer is not Hitler, but Jesus Christ, and we do not submit to the authorities of this world except in so far as we consider them to be just.”</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Treasonists Offer General Butler 83,000,000</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font8">OT sure what church Gerald C. MacGuire belongs to, alleged by General Smedley D. Butler as having told him that he had $3,000,000 'on the line’ for starting a Fascist revolution in the United States, but can guess. He probably is connected with the same gang that, for the good of the country, was recently run out of Mexico. Spain is in agony for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not sure, even, if Grayson Mallet-Prevost Murphy, MacGuire’s employer, knows what church MacGuire belongs to, or if he belongs to the same church. Probably neither of these is the ringleader in this conspiracy. The real conspirators doubtless have their collars on backwards, the same as their consciences. Those birds are clever enough to let some man with no more sense than MacGuire do their dirty work for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">General Butler has rendered a great service to America in 'spilling the beans’ for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font8"> particular gang at </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font8"> particular time. He let them disclose all their plans, chief among which was to have General Butler head an army of 500,000 men, to assemble in Washington a year from now and take over the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Butler would not betray the country, the job was to be turned over to Douglas MacArthur, chief of staff of the United States Army, with Hanford MacNider, former commander of the American Legion, as third choice. Here is hoping MacArthur and MacNider would have stood the test as well as General Butler. Butler, probably America’s most capable military man, has denounced war as “the most vicious racket known to man”. He has twice received Congressional medals of honor, having served with great distinction in Cuba, China, Nicaragua, Haiti, Mexico, the Philippines, and France. MacGuire picked the wrong bird, but some other man from his discredited church gang will doubtless yet find a way to put this scheme across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The men who got MacGuire into this thing should be ferreted out, even if the trail leads to Vatican City direct, and if it results in the exposure of the old man who recently told the Dominicans to get ready to repeat their work of Inquisition. Wonder if MacGuire ever read the U. S. Constitution, Article III, Section 3, about levying war against the United States, and what he thinks is treason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What we are in for in America when this bloodthirsty gang of murderers get in control of the government may be judged from the following extract from a letter from Germany, detailing how critics of the Fascist regime are treated in that land of darkness. One who knows the facts says;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is difficult to describe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font6"> men are mistreated there. They are beaten, tyrannized and physically and mentally tortured almost to death. At their dismissal they must in writing pledge themselves not to tell anybody one word how they were treated, otherwise they would be immediately arrested again and subjected to even more cruel treatment. If one refuses to sign such an obligation he is confined to a wet cellar room, receives only water and bread, no light, no bed and no chair or anything else to sit upon; and there he remains under most unsanitary conditions until he becomes soft and is willing to sign the pledge. At an inspection of the concentration camp by representatives of the public press, and at another occasion by medical doctors, one who had been horribly mistreated was asked by visitors the cause of his wounds, and according to instructions that were given him preceding the inspection, he had to tell the visitors that his wounds were caused by a heavy fall at the time of his arrest.”</span></p>

That is all as regular as the clock, and ensures some cash contributions from Big Business that will run into large figures.

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE Providence </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font8"> tells of a little boy born this past summer to young parents that are on relief. The mother, already the mother of two other little ones, was but twenty years of age when little William Ronald Leamy arrived. The father, employed as a life-saver at a city bathing resort, received a nominal wage of $9 per week. The mother thought she was feeding her child properly; she gave it all she had; but subsequent examination of the corpse showed that the baby died of starvation at its mother’s own breast. She could not feed herself and the rest of the family properly on the pittance which her husband received. Oscar Ameringer comments on this in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American Guardian</span><span class="font8"> that Rhode Island contains more millionaires per square mile than any other state. It is probably Ameringer who says in the same paper, “It’s a cock-eyed world where a family raises enough cotton to make 800 pairs of overalls and don’t get enough back to patch the overalls they earned last year plowing cotton under.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N HARD times families double up and go in with their relatives. In this way an immense amount of relief work is done that never gets into print in any manner whatever. In Wheeling, W. Va., 21 percent of the homes contain doubled families. Other large percentages are Birmingham 14.6, Indianapolis 13.3, St. Paul 11, and Dallas 10.8. In sixty-three cities 9.5 percent of the families are living in with others, and in the cities investigated thirty-two, or just over half, have more doubled families than they have vacant residential units. This shows why things are slack in the building trades: the people cannot afford either to buy or to rent; all their efforts are bent on mere living.</span></p>

No two persons look exactly alike, except twins sometimes, and they usually develop differences of manner, tastes, dispositions, that distinguish one from the other. It is true, of course, that the whole human race is built upon the same architectural lines. But nature seems to take delight in so arranging the details of form and features, so marking the lines on the fingers and the convolutions of the brain, so distributing the faculties and varying the temperament, that each man or woman is a distinct and different creation. . . . What does all of this signify? It signifies, for one thing, that nature holds that variety is the spice of life and that life needs spice. It signifies, for another, that nature is opposed to rigid uniformity in human affairs and stands firmly for the individual as the basic factor of human action. We hear a great deal in these troublous days about the passing of individualism and of the new era of collectivism when men will be regimented and operated in the mass for the common good. Maybe so; maybe not. But this I know, nature will go on creating distinct individuals, so different in their character [istics], their ideas, their desires, their emotions, so different in everything, that it is only by force or the persuasion of dire necessity that they can be regimented, and when necessity disappears it is by force alone that they can be so maintained. . . . There is nothing so productive of permanent satisfaction in life [as faith in God], nothing that contributes so much to sense of security in its diversities and adversities. Moreover, there is nothing so stimulative to the higher qualities of personality, the larger values of existence. ‘Faith in an all-seeing and personal God elevates the soul, purifies the emotions, sustains human dignity, and lends poetry, nobility, and holiness to the commonest state, condition and manner of life. ’ Any life, indeed, is gravely deficient without it. . . . And finally, as a fitting pinnacle of the structure of these remarks let me present to you for your constant consideration that much worn but always pregnant and moving admonition of William Cullen Bryant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘So live that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan which moves</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To that mysterious realm where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death Thou go not like the quarry slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.’ ”</span></p>

The legs of the tower are of 5,000 tons of structural steel segments, riveted together, each segment weighing 50 to 80 tons. The order for steel is the greatest ever placed, and amounts to more than is contained in all the buildings of San Francisco put together. The bridge is designed to handle 16,000 cars hourly. There will be no lumber in the completed bridge, but enough will be used in constructing coffer dams and otherwise to make 3,000 five-room frame houses. 1,300,000 barrels of cement will be required to make the 1,000,000 cubic yards of concrete underwater structures.</span></p>

Each pier is the equivalent of a sixty-story building. No other bridge ever had fifty-one great piers. No other bridge was ever so high above waterborne traffic, 218 feet. There are 70,800 miles of cable, almost enough to gird the earth three times. The cables when spun together are 28½ inches in diameter. It will require 200,000 gallons of paint to cover the bridge.</span></p>

He is charged with fraud and intent to evade tax. The government is also trying to collect $1,275,644 from Charles E. Mitchell, former president of the National City Bank, for income taxes he failed to pay in 1929 and 1930. He claimed that he sold stocks to his wife, but she paid him nothing and he received the stocks back again. Both Mellon and Mitchell have been acquitted of criminal fraud by juries, the respect for wealth being so great in the United States that the rich are granted special immunity. Anyone who cheats the government is considered rather clever. Governor Langer, of North Dakota, after sentence to prison for defrauding the federal government, was renominated by the Republican party. Both Republicans and Democrats resent any interference with Big Business on the part of the government. Andrew Mellon is honored among Americans as the ‘greatest secretary of the treasury since Hamilton’. He is an employer who has exploited labor and refused to recognize unions. He admits that his income for 1931, two years after the panic he helped to create, was $10,890,485; the Treasury shows that it was really $15,981,568, enough to support 7,500 families in comfort.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8">T MOULTON, Ala., a Baptist minister killed the 83-year-old deacon of his church on the public highway and was tried for murder. Not sure just why the “Reverend” butchered the old gentleman, but it was probably over money matters. “Reverends” who desire to kill people seem to pick on the very old and the very young; it is probably well that this is so, because if one of them got into a scrimmage with a real man he would stand no chance at all; that is, the “Reverend” would not stand any chance. Not having any occupation, and lying in bed until noon every day, softens the muscles and really turns a person into a creature that ought properly to wear both skirts and pants; and that is what many of them do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE taxicab business in Wellsburg, W. Va., seems to be good. This is a place where young couples come to ride in taxicabs, and afterwards they are married. The taxicab drivers understand their business so well that one minister is now allowed to keep but 50 cents for the ceremony; the taxicab driver gets the rest. Of course, 50 cents is all it is worth, so the minister is adequately paid. Some of the drivers are more generous. One of them splits fifty-fifty with the minister. The minister who made the best deal with the taxi driver had 1,495 couples in 1931, 1,258 in 1932, and 1,258 in 1933. Wellsburg is a convenient Gretna Green for young couples from Ohio and Pennsylvania.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jesus chose better company. When He was on earth He selected the company of publicans and harlots, because they really wanted to get into something better and were sick of the whole hypocritical condition of things about them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>The Heirs of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The heirs of God are the real nobility of the earth; the ones just named are not. Very few of them, indeed, have had any desire whatever for the vindication of God’s name, any desire whatever for the blessing of their fellow men either here or hereafter, and among them, in all ages, have been the chief, most active persecutors of Jesus and those who have had the spirit of Jesus and been, like Him, faithful witnesses to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus went to the trouble of making this matter perfectly clear to the chief priests. On a certain day He overthrew the tables of the money-changers in the temple, and the seats of them that sold doves, and on the next day, as He was teaching the people the chief priests and elders came to Him and the following colloquy ensued:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. He answered and said, I will not; but afterward he repented, and went. And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir; and went not. Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.”—Matthew 21: 23-32.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>Harlots Go into the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A subscriber in California, writing of the blessings which have come to her and to others from the writings of Judge Rutherford, says: “Would just say the reality of the scripture quoted (Matthew’ 21: 23-32) was much impressed on me at the Los Angeles convention in the spring. I learned from various sources, friends from different towns, how women who had lived openly immoral lives had embraced the truth, and, much to the consternation of their friends, took their stand. It seems the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font8"> book</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">was written for a special encouragement for some such class, when it calls a spade a spade, and may at first appear rather indelicate. To see such come to the Lord we can truly say, Tt is written,’ and do indeed rejoice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Assured that every lover of righteousness will appreciate it we here quote from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font8"> pages 286, 287:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If man had been making out the genealogy leading up to Christ the names of Tamar, Rahab and Ruth would have been omitted. It is the practice of the self-righteous church-goer of “Christendom” to superciliously lift the eyebrows in “holy” horror at the course of these women or to blush at the mention of some of the things about them as though these things marked them as outcasts and unfit for the elite society of “organized Christianity”. But to the characterdeveloping, “holier-than-thou” chief priests and elders and Pharisees of his day Jesus said: “Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.” (Matthew 21:31,32) Thus Jesus’ words are directly in keeping with Jehovah’s procedure in rejecting other women, perhaps outwardly more refined and righteous according to self-established human standards, and permitting Tamar, Rahab and Ruth, branded by some as mere harlots, to get into the ancestry of the Chief One of the kingdom of God, Jesus Christ. Probably the Lord God put these in as a rebuke to those who think they can outline a standard by which others may enter the house of the Lord. God himself has prepared the way, and it is presumptuous for anyone to question or criticize the way that he has prepared.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The identity of Mary Magdalene with Mary the sister of Lazarus would probably have been universally admitted long ago but for the Devil, but it is convenient for hypocrites to believe that Mary Magdalene was a very bad woman and that Mary the sister of Lazarus was a very ‘good’ woman, a regular character-developer, or the very opposite of what Mary Magdalene is supposed to have been. Here are some facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was Mary, the sister of Lazarus and of Martha, who wiped the Lord’s </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">feet</span><span class="font8"> with her hair. (John 11:2) Let us read the accounts and see their substantial harmony. If any object to their referring to the same thing, let them object. If they </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font8"> refer to the same thing, then here is a great lesson for us all:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Simon</span><span class="font6"> the leper, there came unto him a woman having an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">alabaster box</span><span class="font6"> of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">very precious ointment,</span><span class="font6"> and poured it on his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">head,</span><span class="font6"> as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">body,</span><span class="font6"> she did it for my burial.”— Matthew 26:6-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">alabaster box</span><span class="font6"> of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ointment,</span><span class="font6"> and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wash his feet with tears,</span><span class="font6"> and did </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wipe them with the hairs of her head,</span><span class="font6"> and kissed his feet, and anointed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">them</span><span class="font6"> with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner. And Jesus, answering, said unto him, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Simon,</span><span class="font6"> I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty: and when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">which of them will love him most? Simon</span><span class="font6"> answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. And he turned to the woman, and said unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Simon,</span><span class="font6"> Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">washed my feet with tears, </span><span class="font6">and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">feet</span><span class="font6"> with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.”—Luke 7:37-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And being in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bethany,</span><span class="font6"> in the house of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Simon</span><span class="font6"> the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">alabaster box</span><span class="font6"> of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ointment</span><span class="font6"> of spikenard, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">very precious; </span><span class="font6">and she brake the box, and poured it on his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">head.</span><span class="font6"> And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. ”—Mark 14: 3-8,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bethany,</span><span class="font6"> where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. There they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. Then took </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mary </span><span class="font6">a pound of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ointment</span><span class="font6"> of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">feet</span><span class="font6"> of Jesus, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wiped his feet with her hair:</span><span class="font6"> and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Simon’s</span><span class="font6"> son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.”—John 12:1-8.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark180"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>'Why Mary Loved Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is all simple enough why Mary loved Jesus; He himself explained it to Simon. She being of an impetuous, ardent, impulsive temperament, some man had started her on a wrong course and the demons had taken advantage of it and tried to work her utter ruin. When she stood there behind Jesus weeping, and pouring out upon His head and body and feet her savings, and kissing His feet and wiping them with the hairs of her head, Jesus understood what was going on in her heart, and that was what interested </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are almost tempted to change slightly the words of a popular song and to make it read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For ’tis love, and love alone, the Lord is seeking;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And ’tis love, and love alone, that can repay!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’Tis the answer, ’tis the end and all of living, For ’tis love and love alone that rules for aye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world and its hypocrites can never get the right idea. They cannot understand, and it sometimes seems as if they did not wish to understand. In spite of everything that has been said, ‘■'man looketh on the outward appearance, but [Jehovah] looketh on the heart.” (1 Samuel 16:7) Men deceive themselves into acting as if they believed that what God wants is outward, formalistic piety. He wants nothing of the sort. What He does want is the heart. “My son, give me thine heart.” (Proverbs 23:26) When He has that, He has all; when He has it not, He has something that is worse than nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some commentators hold that Magdala and Bethany were one and the same place. It would be strange indeed if Mary whose brother was raised from the dead shunned Jesus in His dying hour, while Mary Magdalene was right there to give Him all the comfort she could. It would be more than strange if the one who loved to sit by Jesus’ side and hear Him explain the way to life would know nothing about His death or burial but that His first revelation of himself after His resurrection would be to this once poor woman of the street, Mary Magdalene, who so loved Him, and was so overwhelmed with contrition and a desire for a better life that she kissed His feet and wiped them with the hairs of her head, as Mary of Bethany also did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Further, how would anyone explain the fact if Luke, the beloved physician, the close observer, was the only one to go into such great detail as to what happened in the house of Simon the Pharisee and yet said nothing whatever about it if a very similar event happened in the house of Simon the leper, though such incident is mentioned by all the other evangelists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, we don’t care what the writers of the Talmud say on any subject, but the Talmudic writers, in their calumnies of Jesus and the early church, have considerable to say about a Miriam Magaddela, and it does look as if Jesus went out of His way to drive home the lesson that the publican who “would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:10-14), was really the one whom God approved. And so a reformed harlot, Mary of Magdala or Bethany, might be, and was, an object of very special interest to Jesus and to God. She it was who threw herself at the feet of the risen Christ, clasped them in her arms and gave vent to that cry “Rabboni [my dear Master]” which echoes yet and will echo forever in the hearts of those for whom He has done the most. —John 20:16.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>Publicans in the Same Category</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By the orthodox Jews the publicans were, if anything, more despised than the harlots. How the money-loving Jews hated these tax gatherers is indicated by the passage which inspired this lesson in obedience, and reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And as Jesus passed forth from thence [where He had healed the man siek of the palsy], he saw </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font6">man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. ’ —Matthew 9: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What more could he do ? Nothing that he could do would change the fact that he had been a tax gatherer for the hated Roman government. But Jesus loved him for his obedience and did not hesitate to have him as a follower and to eat at his house. Matthew Levi the publican went out and invited all his publican friends to a feast in his home:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. ’ ’ —Matthew 9:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The self-righteous will go into destruction proclaiming to the last that they are the salt of the earth, when as a matter of fact they are and have been its outstanding curse. The reason why the publicans and harlots loved Jesus was that they knew their needy estate and made full acceptance of God’s provision for their cleansing. The parable of the “prodigal son” tells the same story. Genuine contrition is precedent to salvation; obedience is contrition in action.</span></p>

Its principal editor is the chief of police of Bergenfield, Scott D. Coombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past seven years, in many communities of New Jersey, public officials, often through lack of knowledge and understanding, have yielded repeatedly to pressure brought upon them by the clergy or their invisible Satanic allies, to imprison Jehovah’s witnesses. In such cases police officers have made arrests in obedience to their superiors. However, after learning that the good work of Jehovah’s witnesses proceeds and prospers according to the commandment of the Most High God, even some superior police officials who at first thoughtlessly opposed have turned around and said to Jehovah’s witnesses: “It is better for you to be doing this good work than to be stealing; more power to you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE PURPOSE OF JEHOVAH as expressed in the Bible is to establish righteousness on the earth under the rule of Christ Jesus and to completely eliminate crime and criminals. Educating the people in the Bible is therefore of most vital importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to inform the people concerning His law, and to do so by going from house to house and exhibiting to them the printed message of the gospel and by encouraging the people to study the same, which work more than any other tends to eradicate crime. (Matthew 24: 14; Luke 9:4; Acts 20:20; Isaiah 6:9; 43:10,12; 61:1, 2) Those who oppose such witness work are either ignorant of God’s purpose or else they are moved by selfish desires. Prejudiced clergymen are the chief opposers of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested and imprisoned in New Jersey because they obey Jehovah’s law in visiting the people at their homes with books containing the gospel message, without first obtaining a permit from the police. Why do they not obtain a police permit to do this work? For the sole reason that Jehovah God is supreme and He has commanded them to do this witness work; and to ask a permit of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">men to do what God has commanded would not only be inconsistent but a violation of their obligation to Jehovah. Like the apostles, they say: “We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That they may be properly identified, Jehovah’s witnesses file with the police their names and addresses before beginning work. Refusing to apply for a permit may cause them to suffer imprisonment. To disobey Jehovah God by asking for a permit would mean their complete destruction. They have no alternative because they love God and will obey Him.—Acts 3: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ is the only possible way to have a world of righteousness free from crime, a condition of prosperity, and peace on earth, and good will toward men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Public officials by opposing and imprisoning Jehovah’s witnesses are fighting against God. (Acts 5:35-39) By being kind to Jehovah’s witnesses and doing them good because they serve Christ, public officials would gain the Lord’s favor which is greatly to be desired.—Matthew 25: 34-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Giving the people a knowledge of what is right helps them to do right. Why not follow God’s way and cooperate with His witnesses?</span></p>
