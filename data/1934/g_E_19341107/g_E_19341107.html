<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Windows of the Soul — and the Land of Darkness</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T IS impossible to consider any of the works of the Creator without being lost in wonder, love and praise. Take a look at the letter “i” as made with the typewriter. Notice the white space between the trunk of the “i” and the dot above it; you have discerned something that is not much if any over 5/1000 of an inch across. Now step outdoors and look at the sky; the nearest star is Alpha Centauri, distant 4.3 light years, or about 24,897,041,280,000 miles. Most of the stars you see are many times as far away. The Swan is distant 50,496,000,000,000,000 miles, or 2,000 times as far away. Do you not think it discloses marvelous love and wisdom on the part of the Creator to place two such instruments in your possession as will enable you in a moment to see things so near and things so remote?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The optical arrangement of the human eye is that of a two-lens microscope. At the front is a body shaped like a watch glass, called the cornea, and at a short distance' behind it a double-convex body, called the crystalline lens. These two are transparent and form an image. The wall of the rear, or retina, is composed of the fibers of the optic nerve, vast numbers of pyramids and cones. The image formed by the lenses falls on the retina upside down. The impression is conveyed to the seeing portion of the brain, far in the back of the head, where it is turned right side up and considered. Man is the best judge of shape and distance of any of the creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At sea or over a level plain the human eye, at a height of five feet from the ground, can see an object a foot in diameter 2.9 miles away. A Patagonian can see an ostrich head at a distance of almost a mile. A perfect eye can discern the light of an ordinary candle two miles away through transparent space. Observers on the coast of France sighted lights on Corsican mountains 186 miles away. Mirror flashes on Mount Shasta, California, were sighted on Mount Helena, 192 miles distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The eye has so many parts that it makes anybody except an oculist have a headache merely to read the names. Briefly, it is an instrument of i/2-inch radius, combining in one a camera, photometer, colorimeter, kaleidoscope, stereoscope, and range finder, automatically adjustable from infinity to a distance of 3 inches. The eye is self-cleansing; every time we wink we wash our eyes. Store eyewashes are unnecessary, but a few drops of boric acid solution in the eyes now and then is refreshing.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Built to Run Forever</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Charles Sheard, director of physics and biophysical research of the Mayo foundation at Rochester, Minn., in a public lecture in Boston stated that his calculations, which he gave, show that an eye has something of the order of a million years of vision; in othei’ words, it was made to last forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The eye can detect 200,000 shades of color. Cotton-seed oil varies much in value according to its color; the only instrument that can rightly measure these differences is the human eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Given two persons with eyes of equal clearness of vision, one will merely see that a passing auto is a dark closed car, while the other will tell that it is a four-door blue sedan, by whom and where made, the year of manufacture, and how many persons were in it. In trials of accident cases the lawyers get many times as much information from some observers as from others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mind to some extent dominates the eye. A group in Montreal all saw a man sitting on a stool on the top of a flagpole; that is what their eyes and minds told them, but when a telescope was brought to bear the man was plainly seen to be sitting on a stool on the roof of a building beyond the one which supported the pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Occasionally nature plays a prank. Alva Mason, 25, an electrician of Minot, Maine, has eyes so focused that within a distance of eight inches they magnify more than 100 times their actual proportions. He is able to distinguish features of phonograph records by the difference in the impression made in the disk. Thus, removing his glasses, he can pick out with unfailing accuracy the anvil strokes in the “Anvil Chorus”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dorken, a German organist, blind from the age of thirteen, sees each tone of the musical scale as a very vivid color. Each human voice, each odor, and every other human sensation, produces in his mind a color, pleasant or otherwise. Even a sneeze has color, for him. All this seems odd to the rest of us.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Differences Much Exaggerated</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">A critical study of 840 Chinese and Japanese by Dr. H. Gifford discloses that the notion of a special “Mongolian eye” is incorrect. Many of these have a fold extending from the skin of the upper lid obliquely downward and inward to the bridge of the nose, but the eye itself is like that of the rest of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Careful studies of a pair of eyes here in the office under all the various types of glances (eight of them) seem to indicate that the so-called “expressions of the eyes” are mainly the expressions of the lids and other muscles around them. There is, however, the element of accommodation, which does somewhat change the shape of the eye itself. At twelve a child can read as easily at three inches from the eye as at arm’s length, but in later life this power diminishes and the actual changes in our eyes themselves are slowly made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Blue eyes are really colorless, there being an absence of pigment in the outer layer of the iris; they are characteristic of northern Europe. Dark eyes of brown pigment protect the retina against too much light from the sun, and are more commonly found among southern races. Blue-eyed parents transmit blue eyes to their offspring; a blue-eyed and brown-eyed couple may have all brown-eyed children, but three-fourths of the grandchildren will be brown-eyed and one-fourth blue-eyed, according to genetical tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been widely observed that dark-eyed women know better what is going on around them than light-eyed ones. The tired brown eyes of the natives of India are the most melancholy in the world, so it is said, but here again it seems clear that it is mainly the eyelids and other muscles about the eye that create the expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We see one thing at a time. Looking at a word we see the letters successively, not simultaneously. The mental images are built up one after the other, each requiring about three two-thousandths of a second. A modern machine proved conclusively the correctness of Aristotle's conclusions as to how it is we see. The old idea of teaching a child an alphabet was a correct idea. In some persons the mental images are much slower than in others, requiring one-seventh of a second in a stationary position before an impression is made.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>All Blind for Three Weeks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The fibers of the optic nerve which carry the consciousness of light to the brain are not completed until three weeks after birth, so that, as a matter of fact, babies do not see anything until they are three weeks old. Brilliant objects gradually awaken the interest and curiosity; through the eyes a pathway is made into the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A physicist explains how we see in colors. He says: “What light does is to perform a photochemical process on the light-sensitive substance in the cornea, from which result four nerve excitants—the sources of our color sensations, yellow and blue, red and green. All the rest of the perceptible color tones are composed of dual color blends of these four.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many persons can recognize blues and yellows to whom all reds and greens appear gray, but a person who is blind to yellow and blue is also blind to green and red, that is, totally color-blind. In persons totally color-blind there are rods in the retina, but no cones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pupil is merely a hole in the iris, and looks black because there is no light inside; it is through this hole, by means of the ophthalmoscope, that an oculist is able to determine the condition of the retina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cornea, which covers the iris and pupil, is highly polished, transparent, and in the perfect eye is symmetrically curved; if not so curved, astigmatism exists, requiring correction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The jelly-like substance which fills the back of the eye is transparent. When placed in water it can be felt, but cannot be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The eye is controlled by six sets of very delicate muscles that act like rubber bands, one pulling and the opposite one stretching every time the eye is moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cataracts are never formed on the outside of the eye, but are due to the lenses’ becoming hard, cloudy and opaque. This will be touched upon later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eyebrows change their position with age. Permanent new eyelashes can be had by surgical transplanting of hair from the scalp, but forever afterward the experimenter has to have them trimmed by the barber, as if they grew on the top of the head. A blond may have dark eyelashes naturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As there are different colors of eyes, classified as blue, gray, green, hazel or black, and sometimes a person may have one eye of one color and one of another, so there are styles of eyebrows, nine of them; the prince of Wales is distinguished by having two of these types, making his features quite different on the two sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Excessive use of the eyes causes them to become heated by the exercise; it is the heat generated that makes them tired.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Care of the Eyes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">One of the best ways to care for the eyes is not to overwork them. If the work is all close work, rest the eyes at frequent intervals by closing them or glancing off at some far-away object for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gentle massage of the eye with the finger tips wet with cold water, practiced for five minutes twice daily, is recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A nasal douche helpful to the eyes is a glass of warm water into which is dissolved the juice of half a lemon. This to be sniffed into the nose gently, night and morning, and blown out vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bathing the eyes with cool water or diluted witch-hazel and resting in a reclining position for half an hour a day helps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rats deprived of Vitamin G developed cataracts. The best sources of Vitamin G are milk, eggs, fresh beef, the germ of wheat (excluded from white flour), fresh yeast, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh vegetables. Spinach, lettuce, yellow corn, and green (unbleached) celery are good to supply elements needed in the perfect development and operation of the eye. The less the greens and vegetables are cooked, the more valuable they are. Drink water freely, ten glasses a day, with a little lemon juice dissolved in each. Discontinue the use of pies, cake and pastry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Keep away from fog, dust, steam, smoke, fumes and vitiated air. Avoid anger, jealousy, fear and worry. Be hopeful and cheerful. Give the skin a daily friction rub. Walk three miles a day. Avoid stimulants and drugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Avoid sudden changes from dark to light. Avoid reading when lying down or when physically or mentally exhausted. Avoid much reading by artificial light. Avoid late hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Avoid too much light and too little light, and avoid too much heat. A man who slept two hours with his face upturned to the hot sun went blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When working by lamplight, shade your lamp so that it will throw the light on your work and not on your eyes; do not work in a flickering light; do not work in mixed daylight and artificial light; have the light over your left shoulder, if right-handed, and over your right shoulder, if left-handed; keep the lamps and globes clean, and use white, cream or yellowish wallpaper. And do not buy wood alcohol, for any purpose whatsoever. The fumes from it have blinded many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All surfaces should be of flat finish, ceilings, side walls, desks and furniture. Glares are never good. Small yellow globes near the book are better than the bright unshaded ceiling lights of a generation ago. When sewing, get your light close to your work. Red paint, red wall paper, red hangings and red decorations generally (including cheeks, lips and finger nails) are abominations to the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When at work where flying metallic particles are possible, by all means wear some sort of spectacles to keep them out of the eyes. Do not permit anybody to use pocketknife or nail file or other crude metal instrument to remove metal slivers. In some large plants an eye magnet is used for taking steel slivers out of the eye. These magnets cannot be used for penetrations of copper, brass, lead, and many alloys, which are therefore much more dangerous than iron or steel. Injuries must be looked after at once; and even then the injury to one eye may cause the loss of the other, even as late as forty years after the injury, due to sympathetic inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good way to remove sand, small insects, or cinders from the eye is to grasp the eyelashes and hold the eyelid away from the eye. This will often allow the tears to wash the foreign body away. For a few cents at almost any good drug store an eyestone can be procured which, kept in the eye over night, performs the same service while one sleeps. Most oculists will remove foreign substances from the eye without charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yellow papers are the most restful to the eyes, especially if unglazed. Black ink on blue paper is the most irritating color combination. There is less fatigue to the eye from yellow than from red, blue or green. It is estimated that eighty percent of headaches are due to eyestrain. Movies, if properly made, do not injure the eyes, as they see in a succession of jerks, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Newfoundland, where the winter regimen includes salt pork, some potatoes, cabbages and turnips (which often run out), night-blindness is common. The most popular remedy is bird’s liver. Oddly enough, the cod liver, which supplies the same deficiency, is not much used by the people who principally produce it for the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have to say a good word for the Kromyer rays, generated by an electrical apparatus manufactured by the Hanovia Chemical and Manufacturing Company, of Newark, N. J. In every important city there is now some up-to-date physician who has this apparatus. The physician at the Bethel, Brooklyn, has one. One of the workers suffered with exquisite pains in one eye. A three-minute treatment of one nostril completely stopped the pain and brought the eye back to normal. The treatments are painless, being merely rays of healing light such as constantly pour forth from the sun. They are projected into the interior of the head through the nostrils, being too powerful to be gazed upon. The patient wears colored glasses, and the treatments are but about three minutes long.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Are Spectacles Necessary?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">That headline looks peculiar to a man who has had glasses on his nose every waking moment for fifty years; but there are several health lecturers going up and down the land, seemingly honest men, who claim that by the use of the methods hereinafter described thousands have been able to lay aside glasses they have worn for years and regain perfect vision. It seems too good to be true, and too nearly impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Robert K. Williams, one of these “no spectacles” enthusiasts, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sit or stand; hold the head rigid. Look to the left as far as possible, then to the right. Without moving the head, look up, then down, as far as possible. Put a strain on the muscles slightly. Roll the eyes from left to right and from right to left, slightly straining the muscles. This quickly clears the eyes of redness and gives them a sense of strength. Now cross the eyes by looking at the tip of the nose, then at the spot between the ejxs; then look forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do these exercises as many times as, in your judgment, is needed. It won’t be long until you will feel better in the eyeballs, and doubtless the vision will be improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tightly closing the eyes three or four times will almost immediately improve the sight, for the time being. When objects become blurred try this easy exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Massaging the eyeballs lightly with the tips of the fingers helps the eyes and prevents ptosis, or dropping of the lids. In fact, massage assists the eye in several ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Blinking into the early morning and evening sun often proves very beneficial. Many people have recovered vision by doing this. A friend of ours, with offices on the 40th floor of the Metropolitan tower, New York, totally blind in one eye, brought vision back to that eye, so that he could read the finest print, by daily peering into the bright sun, from one of the lofty windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ruins of Nineveh yielded a piece of transparent glass some 2,600 years old. Nero was shortsighted; he was wont to gaze on gladiatorial fights through a glass cut from a huge emerald. The first reading glasses, made to be held in the hand, were produced by Roger Bacon, in A.D. 1280. Benjamin Franklin was the inventor of bifocal spectacles; they were called “spectacles” from the Latin name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">spectaculum, </span><span class="font7">something to be seen or looked at, a pageant, a spectacle.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Fight About Rims</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The fight about rims is still on. The ultrarimless, in England, after using monocles for a generation, have at last developed “contact glasses” which are worn under the lids, in contact with the eyeball, and cannot be distinguished. They are rather uncomfortable at first. By this device women with pale gray or blue eyes can have them darkened to any desired shade. These lenses, made in layers, do not break when hit with a hammer, boiled up to 500 degrees, baked in an oven, or frozen in a refrigerator. The device is said to permit of a range of accurate vision at all angles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In America horn-rimmed spectacles appeared twenty years ago and were sold to everybody. Then the spectacle makers discovered, to their sorrow, that the pyralin frames were unbreakable, preventing practically all breakage of lenses, and now they are discouraging their use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Metal rims bend on slight provocation; people who wear them must make occasional trips to the optician for correction. There is usually no charge for this. In cleaning eyeglasses optometrists advise grasping the glasses, and not the nosepiece, so as to avoid loosening the screws in the nosepiece.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Optometrist Propaganda</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">At the annual convention of the American Optometric Association held in San Antonio, Texas, in 1931, it was agreed to spend $6,000,000 in the next four years “in newspapers, magazines and other mediums to stimulate interest in the problems of defective vision”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It does not seem any more heinous for the oculists and optometrists to go in wholesale for propaganda than it does for the allopaths to do it, and yet the whole business of making money out of human defects seems shocking. Thomas J. Barrett, North Dakota, after noting that glasses are merely eye crutches, and that they have been generally worn but about twenty-five years, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About twenty-five years ago certain commercial interests grasped the possibilities of exploiting the eyes of the people in a purely commercial manner. Since that time untold millions have been spent in educating and crystallizing in the minds of the people the theory that the eye must inevitably fail early in life and that all people should adopt glasses by time they reach middle life or much earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the propaganda now in hand, and to which, no doubt, Dr. Barrett would object, reads as follows: “Seven out of every ten persons in the United States are in need of glasses”; “Six out of every ten of us have reduced visual perception”; “Within the next fifty years, if not sooner, eight people out of every ten will be wearing spectacles”; “People with ordinary sight, but engaged in fine work, benefit considerably from wearing glasses especially designed for their particular occupations.” These statements may all be true, but sound suspiciously like the propaganda used to boost the serums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> referring to a convention of the New York State Optometric Association, has the following, which certainly has a familiar ring:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Professor Barstow quoted figures of a 750,000 population area, showing that 24 percent wear glasses and the average price is $16.85 per pair. If multiple pairs were sold to one-third of that population, the optometrists’ business would be increased $1,053,125, he said.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A California optician who examined many fine specimens of black manhood, of the Wa-kamba and Masai tribes of Africa, who had never strained their eyes over printing, microscopes, test-tubes or machines, was surprised to find not one perfect eye among them, and admitted that “a really perfect eye, even among children, is as rare as a purple elephant”. Man has his limitations.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Plenty of Mechanical Aids</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">What with bifocal spectacles separately fitted to each eye, telescopes to see distant objects, microscopes to see little objects, stroboscopes to slow up the motion of objects moving too swiftly for the eye to see, oscilloscopes to catch the movement of objects too vibrant, spectroscopes to sort out the mixed radiation of white light, pyrometers to record things too radiant for the eye to gaze upon, radiometers to detect the invisible infra-red or heat waves, spectrophotometers to perform feats of color analysis, X-rays to reveal things through opaque materials, and photo-cells to ensnare the unseen ultraviolet radiations, man cannot cornplain of lack of progress in the optic arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Feinbloom telescopic spectacles (three lenses before each eye instead of one) widely publicized two years ago, have benefited some, but many were sadly disappointed. Trifocals and quadrifocals, announced early this year, are probably on the market by now. A Hungarian oculist has invented a form of protective spectacles in which a sheet of transparent metal foil a millionth of a millimeter thick is placed between two sheets of glass; the effect is to keep heat rays out of the eyes. The kratometer, which works by manipulating prisms, is used to correct cross-eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By a new method of sending powerful beams of light into the side of the eye, the interior of the eye may now be examined through a microscope. For automobile drivers there are now to be had very wide-rimmed glasses, on the outside edges of which are small mirrors, so that the wearer can see the road behind him. The reflectors do not interfere with the vision ahead. The Nordenson camera enables the taking of pictures of the retina. There is no truth to the oft-repeated statements that photographs of murderers are ever found on the retinas of victims. Eyeshades, once in favor, then discarded, are now advised where workers are compelled to work where lights are inferior.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Land of Darkness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Can you think of a land of absolute darkness, a land where the sun never shines, where the lights are never lit, where not a color may be seen, not even the somberest gray? There is a land where just such conditions prevail. There are one hundred thousand people living in that land, doing the same things that you are doing, doing them cheerfully, and with surprising efficiency, too. The land is all about you. It is the United States of America. It is estimated that there are 6,000,000 sightless in the world, and that at least 100,000 of these are in the United States. If that be true it means that in every village of 1,000 persons there is one who is in this land of darkness; in every city of 10,000 there are ten such persons; in every city of 100,000 there are one hundred; in every city of a million inhabitants there are a thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In England there are 2,307 blind under sixteen years of age, and there has been an increase in the blind population of 35,000 within fourteen years. In Spain, with a population of only 20,500,000, it is claimed that 25,000 persons go blind every year, due to inattention to cases of smallpox, scarlatina, meningitis, and sexual maladies. If these unfortunates live only eight years each after they go blind, this would make ten times as many blind persons in proportion to the population as there are in the United States. In Syria the conditions are still worse than in Spain; for a Turkish civilization is still worse than a Boman Catholic one.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Neonatal Blindness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">When one considers the route by which we all come into the world, and the fact that for some little time the eyes of the newly born are exposed to whatever infection may he present in the womb, it is wonderful, in view of the fallen condition of humanity and of the widespread scourges of syphilis and gonorrhea, that half the people in the world were not born blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As matters stand it is calculated that in the United States twenty-four percent of all cases of blindness are due to neonatal conditions— the failure of doctors, nurses and midwives to give attention to the child’s eyes immediately after its birth. The modern method requires all doctors to treat the eyes of the newborn with a solution of nitrate of silver. This causes temporary soreness of the eyes of the infant, but is an almost sure preventive of blindness. If it is not done, and the lids become swollen, with a discharge of pus, in a few days the case is hopeless. There are in the United States today something like 25,000 persons who are totally blind because their eyes were neglected during the first few’ days after birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It does not follow that because a child is born blind either of its parents may have sinned sexually. Physicians state that one-fourth of all persons who contract syphilis do so innocently. It is conveyed by drinking cups and other household utensils. Babies have contracted it from a kiss of an older person. The way in which this disease affects the babies is to cause inflammation of the cornea, the window of the eye, and eventually to destroy it if the disease is not arrested or cured. Data at hand show that, in Scotland, out of every two children in schools for the blind, one is blind as a result of sexual disease inherited from its parents.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Danger to Little Folks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">There are plenty of dangers to the little folks, for years to come. Blindness often comes to children as a result of measles or scarlet fever, due to the patient’s room's not being sufficiently darkened. The eyes at such a time, and for weeks afterward, should be allowed as nearly absolute rest as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there is considerable reason to fear blindness as a result of accidents with forks, scissors, arrows, air rilles, exploding golf balls, and toy pistols. In not a few instances wild birds and domestic fowls have been known to pick the eyes out of infants and even of children able to run about. No doubt these birds were quite as unconscious of what they were doing as were the children of any danger from being in their vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes the little folks have ulcers of the eye, resulting in extreme sensitiveness to the light. The child will do almost anything to protect its eyes from the light. This affection may be due to insufficient ventilation in sleeping quarters, to tea, coffee, poor candy as well as too much candy, cakes, pastry, and bananas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then when the little folks become able to attend school they run the danger of conjunctivitis, or pink eye, an inflammation of the inner side of the lids which makes them feel as if there were sand in them. The lids gum together in the morning, and unless medical attention is provided blindness is liable to result. In the early part of the present century the schools in New York city were filled with cases of trachoma, as this disease is called, supposed to have largely come from the great numbers of Russian Jews then coming into the port; but within two years, as a result of close attention by the teachers and medical inspectors, the disease was virtually obliterated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The eyes of humans do not reach maturity until eight years of age; therefore it is quite wrong to send children to school earlier. Parents should pay close attention to the lights by which the children study, as they become tired or sleepy very quickly when trying to work in a poor light. A youngster who is inclined to headaches and digestive disturbances may be suspected of having need of glasses or having his diet better looked after, or both. Of 2,000 children studied forty-five percent were found needing glasses, or correction of diet, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Montpelier district in the south of France, out of ten generations of 2.121 persons, 135 were night-blind. These children could not help this. There are occasional cases of congenital total color-blindness, where everything is seen in gray. The children cannot help that either. The children cannot help crossed eyes, and it is a mistake to suppose that they correct themselves. The parents have to give them attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though there are known to be 50,000 school children in the United States suffering from defective vision, special educational facilities are provided for only 4,000 of them. Lewis H. Carris, of the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness, in an address on “Education of Exceptional Children”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The books used in sight-saving classes are usually in very large type. Much of the work is done on the blackboard, to relieve eye-strain. Adjustable seats and desks are used, and particular care is exercised in regard to the lighting arrangement in the classroom. Every child is taught the touch system on the typewriter as soon as possible, so that the eye-strain of handwriting may be avoided.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ The per capita cost of educating children in sightsaving classes is usually from $200 to $250; it ranges from $132 to $331 per year. The per capita cost of educating other groups shows an equally wide variation: in regular grades, from $47 to $124; in classes for the deaf, from $226 to $431; in orthopedic classes, from $S8 to $378.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Accidents to Adults</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">It is only about a thousand years since a victorious commander put out both eyes of 15,000 men defeated in battle and sent them home over the mountains in companies of 100 each, with a leader deprived of only one eye. In the World War many more than 15,000 were blinded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States 15,000 are totally blind as the result of accidental injury in industrial occupations, and 2,000 workers lose the sight of one or both eyes each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mechanics lose their sight from flying sparks, splashing metal, chippings from castings, unprotected emery wheels, acid burns, chemical explosions, bursting gauges, soiled handkerchiefs, soiled hands, and dirty matches and toothpicks in the hands of fellow workmen who are engaged in rendering first aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three men out of one hundred whose eyes are exposed to intense heat and injurious light rays go blind, and these three are always those who refuse to be bothered with goggles or helmets; yet the use of goggles and helmets may make all the difference between a highly-paid skilled workman and a nearly helpless beggar. In one county in Ohio one eye is lost every eleven days in the year. Is it not supposable that the next man who is to lose his eye would be very careful if he knew what would happen ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Miners and train dispatchers suffer from a peculiar form of eye dancing called nystagmus. Snow-blindness is really sunburn on the eyes. Many women have blinded themselves by painting their eyelashes with aniline derivatives and preparations containing silver nitrate. Scores were blinded by bootleg liquor in the “prohibition” days. Eight citizens in Calgary alone were partially blinded as a result of watching an eclipse of the sun without the aid of darkened glasses. A drop of nitric or sulphuric acid is sufficient to destroy the sight of an eye. Tear gas is blinding in its effects. Home life is dangerous. Many an eye has been lost in using a table fork to untie a badly knotted shoe lace, or in trying to remove a bottle cap with a knife, fork or ice pick.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Achievements of the Blind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">A number of blind young men and women have been graduated from high schools of New York, Chicago, and other cities; and some of them are students in colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instances are common of blind people whose sense of hearing or of air pressure is so keen that they can detect telephone poles six to ten feet away. Paul Donehoo, a blind Atlanta lawyer and musician, not only is able to sense the walls, posts, and other obstacles along his path, but can follow the building line along the sidewalk entirely by sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rene Leroy, a Paris blind man, once, as a test, walked into a strange barber shop, ordered a shave and haircut, expressed his satisfaction with it, got up and walked straight to the cash desk, which he had located by sound, paid his bill, got his change, stepped to the door and into the street, without anyone in the shop knowing that he was blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A blind lawyer of New York, Benjamin Berin-stein, one of three executors of a $400,000 estate, was sued by the other two executors on the ground that as a blind man he was not a fit legal guardian for two children whose interests in the estate he was particularly looking after. When the action came up in court he made a dignified and brilliant speech, citing the work of some of the world’s great blind men and women, including the poet Milton, ex-Senator Gore of Oklahoma, Helen Keller, and others, and referring modestly to his own attainments, with the result that the presiding surrogate dismissed the case, stating that it should never have been brought into court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Helen Keller, blind, deaf, and dumb, and without sense of smell since she was nineteen months of age, converses with anybody. With her highly trained fingers she reads the lips of the one talking to her, and then with those same highly trained fingers replies by the touch system in the palm of the hand of her secretary, who translates her words into speech. She is a college graduate, and the author of several books. Her first advent into the world of knowledge was when her teacher patiently and persistently drew the letter “w” with water in the palm of her hand and she finally grasped the thought that “w” stood for water. Recently, when the Pictorial Review Company awarded her its annual prize of $5,000 she turned it over to the American Foundation for the Blind, and said in part: “I wonder if this is not the day for which I became deaf and blind—so that the sun may rise in the minds of others who are covered with a double darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John Dwyer, of Thuries, Irish Free State, blind from early youth, devoted a lifetime to the repairing of watches and clocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Miss Ivie M. Mead, of Middletown, Connecticut, took the first prize in needlework at the county fair. She entered a crocheted slumber robe, attractively striped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In New Britain, Connecticut, Arthur Sullivan, blind newspaper reporter, saved the life of his blind wife, whose clothing had ignited at a gas range. He dragged her into an adjoining room and smothered the flames with a rug. Subsequently he underwent a skin-grafting operation in a further effort to save her life from the burns inflicted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The blind learn to write readily. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hygeia</span><span class="font7"> magazine explains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A rubber band is passed around a pad where the writing should begin. Two other light bands are passed vertically around the pad at about half an inch from each edge of the paper. As each line is completed the horizontal band is slipped down an inch. By keeping the finger on the band an even and legible writing can be produced with little practice.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Recovery of Sight</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Here are ten instances of persons entirely blind for many years, all but two of whom recovered their sight within the past seven years:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mrs. Carrie Sillery, 76, of Roachdale, Ind., blind for thirty years, awoke from an afternoon nap, February 18, 1928, able to see as well as ever. Prior to the restoration of her sight she had severe eye pains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David Finkelstein, 25 years old, lawyer, of Sea Gate, N. Y., was blind for five months, losing his sight suddenly while reading a book. His physician performed two operations for sinus infection. After the second one, and while on the way home from the doctor’s office, sight suddenly returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J. F. Fish, president Northwestern Business College, Chicago, was suddenly blinded on his wedding trip, in 1899, when a tree fell on him. In June, 1930, his wife was reading to him, when, suddenly, his sight returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joan Getaz, Lincoln, Nebr., was bom blind but suddenly gained her sight when 18 years of age. She was surprised that all people do not look alike. She tried to step over a sunbeam. She took pink and white pigs for persons. She thought trees were like humans; she had no conception of their height. She thought a boy with a mustache had a diseased face. She still shuts her eyes when she wants to dress in a hurry. She got her sight in 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Earl Musselman, 22, of Allentown, Pa., born without pupils in his eyes, gained sight by an operation in the early part of 1931. Human faces puzzled him. He could not understand why a full-face view should differ from a profile. He distinguished pictures of men from those of ■women by the fact that the men wear ties. When he first started to read print he had to translate the printed letters into the raised dots of the Braille alphabet before he could figure out the words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jacob Lieberman, 87, blind for twenty years in the Home of the New York Guild for Jewish Blind, recovered his sight by an operation in June, 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Frank Rentz, Madison, Wis., was born blind, but at two years of age the corneas of an animal's eyes were grafted upon his own and the operation was a complete success. It was three years after the operation before sight was normal. The young man, now twenty-four, recently graduated with honors from the Wisconsin University Law School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sylvester Flynn, Pittsburgh, Pa., now 25 years of age, was blind eighteen years. An operation in August, 1932, helped him to recover his sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In London, England, H. H. Watson, 29 years of age, blind for twenty-five years, regained his sight through corneas grafted on his eyes. This took place this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gertrude Musier, of Flushing, N. Y., 19 years of age, blind from infantile paralysis for fifteen years, gradually regained her sight in April of this year without any operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In six of the ten cases above cited, physicians helped in the recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the best physician of all is the Great Physician. And as we think of the unfortunates to whom the bright sunlight is darker than the darkest midnight, how our hearts thrill as we read the story of blind Bartimteus! Nothing can excel the beauty of this story just as it appears on the pages of the Book of books:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And as he went out of Jerieho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartinueus, the son of T imams, sat by the highway side, begging. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he callelh thee. And he easting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy frith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.—Mark 10: 46-52.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Employments of the Blind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">In Japan almost all masseurs are blind; so much is it the custom for them to adopt this profession that the words in Japanese for ‘blind man’ and ‘masseur’ are the same. In China the traditional employment of the blind is fortunetelling. In England 100 blind soldiers are telephone operators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Atlanta, Georgia, there is a blind student who pays his way through law school by calling the class roll of 200 members purely from memory. He identifies each voice immediately. Blind persons do not hear better than others, but simply seem to because they listen harder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The blind have found employment in factories in assembling machine parts, running drill presses on small work, foiling mints, packing candy, setting up cartons, wrapping butter blocks, taping coils for armatures, and nutting bolts. In one factory a blind man now does all the work formerly done by two girls with perfect vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Henry Ford’s great automobile plant he employs four men who are totally blind. One blind man in a Cleveland factory, always clean shaven, always smiling, and always on time, receives $40 a week. The total number of operations performed by the blind in various Cleveland factories is 69. There are some concerns that employ blind typists, the dictation being by means of the dictaphone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are 150 blind news-dealers in New York. One of these news-dealers made the statement that his patrons steal his papers, steal pennies off the stand, give two cents instead of three, pass bad money, take three or four papers and pay for but one. One man selected four magazines, gave a dollar of stage money in payment and accepted twenty cents change from the blind man he had robbed. Many times men and women thrust a nickel into the hand of the blind news-dealer and then insist that they have given him twenty-five or fifty cents.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Helping the Blind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">There is every reason why those who are not blind should do everything humanly possible to help those who are. In Austria and Portugal the war-blind travel at the expense of the state; in South Africa the war-blind are allowed fifty percent reduction on tickets; in Norway, at certain seasons, blind students and their guides may travel for a total of one and one-half fares. In Berlin blind people are allowed to travel free on all street cars. In Belgium, Holland, and France a blind worker, when undertaking a railway journey necessitated by the exercise of his trade or profession, has the right to make the journey accompanied by his guide, on purchasing only one ticket, which entitles them both to transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Skilled surgeons now remove cataracts, slicing the eyeball almost in two. A glass lens is fitted in place of nature’s own lens which has become opaque. Details of the operation performed on Merwin Jenkins, 25 years of age, Lansing, Michigan, born blind, say that for the rest of his life he must remove his lens every twelve hours, apply a special mucilage, and return it to the eye socket. Jenkins is a radio entertainer, married, and has a two-year-old daughter. King Prajadhipok came all the way from Siam to have a similar operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By means of a local anesthetic the cataract is removed without pain. Most cases of cataract have back of them twenty to twenty-five years of constipation or other evidences of imperfect elimination. Get your blood full of dirt, and keep it full of dirt, and eventually some of the dirt will settle somewhere, and where inconvenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The education of the blind began in 1784. In 1829 came the important invention of Louis Braille, a group of six dots in which the vertical line consists of three dots and the horizontal of two. Sixty-three combinations of these six dots may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York library contains about 12,000 books in Braille, with some 3,000,000 printed in ink. It also has 6,000 raised music scores for the study of blind music readers. There are said to be 900 certified workers serving to produce fresh reading material for the blind, using the Braille system. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Searchlight</span><span class="font7"> quarterly, printed in Braille, is read by children in France, Italy, Abyssinia, Egypt, India, Scotland, China, Japan, Australia and Canada. Diaries for the blind are published in Braille. Books printed in Braille cost from $12.50 to $30 per volume. The federal government has granted an annual appropriation of $100,000 for books for blind adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Max Herz, a blind Viennese doctor, has invented a device by which dots and dashes, representing letters of the alphabet, when punched in strips of paper, are transferred to phonograph records, and a complete book can be put on one small record. The system has been learned in a day, whereas the finger touch systems sometimes require a year. Dr. Herz has been assisted in this work by the Austrian and Polish governments.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Other Helps to the Blind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most remarkable of all the helps for the blind is the visagraph, invention of Robert E. Naumburg, of Cambridge, Mass. When a book is inserted in this machine, an electric eye, in a rolling carriage of brass, roams back and forth across the printed page. What this “eye” sees is reproduced in embossed letters upon a roll of aluminum foil, which the blind readily learn to read. The foil may be preserved for future reading, or run through a pair of rollers and used over again. The height of the visagraph letters is always the same, regardless of the size of printed letters in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The photo-electrograph, a French invention, seems to embody some of the principles of the visagraph, or the “printing visagraph”, as Mr. Naumburg prefers to call his invention. The optaphone, invented by Professor d’Albe, instructor in physics at the University of Birmingham, is a similar device which aims to help the blind by converting the visible outlines of the letters into audible sounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The father of Lord Sanderson, Labor peer of Britain, helped him by steadfastly pursuing the peculiar course of refusing to admit that his son’s total blindness from birth was anything more than shortsightedness. He refused to allow any to help him up or down stairs or over difficult pieces of road. In some blind institutions there are signs warning all visitors to refrain from any expressions whatever of pity, as these expressions do harm instead of good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York Association for the Blind teaches roller-skating to blind children, finding it helps to create the confidence they so much need. A London doctor has made an invention whereby the blind can do crossword puzzles and acrostics. The system by which dogs are trained to care for the blind was explained in our issue of July 18, 1934. There are now sixty such dogs in use in America.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The most wonderful help that can come to anybody is something that will lift the darkness from the mind. Read the following letter, from J. H. Baughy, of Alabama, addressed to Judge Rutherford, and see the grand opportunity now open to Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am sorry to take up your valuable time with this letter, but feel I must express my gratitude and thankfulness to Jehovah God for His great truth. I wish to let you and all the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> readers know how well I appreciated hearing your twelve lectures on phonograph records, which one of Jehovah’s witnesses here made it possible for me to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">She and other friends meet here at our house to study the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font6"> each Wednesday night. As I am eighty-four years old, blind and partly deaf, it is a great joy to have them meet here. Each evening we spend together is wonderful, but on this particular evening, most wonderful of all, when she brought her portable phonograph along, she had me sit down at the table and told me to listen, as she had a great surprise for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When I heard your voice, so clear and distinct, I could hardly express the great thrill, the great joy I received. It was a glorious surprise for me, and the greatest evening we have ever spent. I am sure those records will be a great help in spreading the Kingdom message. My wife enjoyed them so much, and joins me in sending our love and best wishes to you and all the fellow workers everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The International Bible Students Association is publishing some of its books for the blind, and once per month issues </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> for the blind. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> will be pleased to aid any of the blind who are interested in Bible study to avail themselves of the benefit of this literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Golden Age of Business </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Hugo B. Fach (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE archbishop AVickmann of Magdeburg (1150-1192) gave the starting signal. In order to get a new revenue he ordered all coins to be withdrawn twice a year and to be recoined against a minting fee of about 30 percent yearly. Other clerical and secular princes, having at that time the right to mint coins for their districts, were only too -willing to imitate this new example of filling their chronically empty treasury. To simplify the process of reminting, these coins, of -which there existed only one kind, were made of thin silver plate, and called thin pennies, dinares. Small change was made by simply breaking them, for which purpose dividing lines -were indicated on them. In general, the recoining fee -was fixed at 20 to 25 percent per year. One of the princes is reported to have renewed the coins during a 32 years’ rule about 100 times, that is, three times a year. In Poland one ruler went even so far as to withdraw the coins four times a year, “at every fair” (market).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These thin plates (“Bracteats”) were the only money in Europe from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, report the historians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hoarding money thus became impossible. He who would have withheld his money would have lost it after a year. Every money owner was placed in the same position as the owner of wares. He wanted to get rid of his money as much as the owner of goods that also deteriorate with the time. Consequently, in order to avoid the minting fee when due, he tried to exchange his money for wares which he could make use of, or he loaned it to somebody, or paid debts or wages. Thus he escaped the depreciation of receiving only 12 for every 16 pennies he gave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interesting is the fact that debts were not affected by this depreciation. He who incurred debts of, say 100 pounds, had to pay this debt back in the agreed amount and value of at the day when it was granted. And by the semiannual or annual withdrawal of the coins the new coins suffered a depreciation from date of issue so that the depreciation got evenly distributed all over the year on all money owners. What cost 12 pennies at the beginning of the year, would cost 13 pennies three months later, 14 pennies after 6 months, 15 after 9 months, 16 after a year, when 16 pennies were turned in for 12 new pennies. In this way the purchasing power of money was maintained at the same level all the time and without money’s being hoarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The depreciation, putting money into circulation, although received with curses, became unexpected blessing which the people had never fully understood as to its origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Money had become the genuine medium of exchange which it had never been before or after. This money no more ruled, exploited, tyrannized, ruined. It only served the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Speedily it hurried from hand to hand. It was spent in order to receive, and by continued selling and buying, production and distribution went on without interruption. The exchange of goods and money was taking place on an even level. Both, money and wares, were standing under compulsion to enter the market, because of deterioration. ‘Without interruption, production and exchange could go on incessantly, to the limit of human abilities to produce and the intensity of human wants to be satisfied. Within a generation a change had taken place from poverty to wealth, from cultural darkness to light. All available money was without much delay turned into useful and life-easing and beautifying goods, and every producer knew that his products would be sold or that he could turn to the production of goods in demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The historians agree that that era was an age of plenty, that poverty was unknown, that general prosperity had spread to all who worked, that the workmen found as much work as they wanted to perform, that wages were unbelievably high, measured by their purchasing power, that the satisfaction of material wants gradually led to voluntarily working less, that the workers decided on a four-day week, that almost everything was paid in cash, that long indebtedness disappeared, that more and more quality goods were made, that the finest quality and most durable clothes were worn, that the homes were richly equipped with beautiful furniture and precious pottery, that peasants, considered the lowest class, were wearing gold or silver buttons, in double line mostly, on vest and coat, that shoes were worn with big silver buckles and ornaments, and that social differences between high and low, between nobleman and peasant, had almost been done away with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Johannes Butzbach, one of the chroniclers of that period, records that the low people, the workers, had rarely less than four courses at the meals, that food was something negligible, that workers, boarding with their masters, as often was the case in those days, were legally protected by city or county ordinances as to quality, quantity and kind of food they were entitled to besides their wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world, under such conditions, was big enough for a far larger population. No idea of birth control worried them, and the population increased rapidly. Hundreds of now important towns and cities, such as Berlin, Bern, Fribourg in Switzerland, Riga, etc., were founded, wide areas of the East settled, beautiful castles built at selected beauty spots of the landscape, and visions of those marvels of edifices realized at which we gaze today in awe and admiration. Simple trades were gradually turned into craftsmanship, finally developed into art, to satisfy the eternal craving for more beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Greeks Not Honest</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS a great surprise the other day to find out that there are some Greeks that are not honest. It is not so around Brooklyn. Around here they are all models, but it seems that in Athens they have developed a technique at getting the best of telephone, electric light and gas companies that has caused those benefactors of human society some anxiety. Telephone companies are beaten by the discovery by Athens natives that after they have telephoned they can get their money back by dialing “0”; electric light companies are worsted by running the meters backward by a little shift in the wiring; and the gas companies are mourning because the Athenians blow down their gas pipes and put the gas meters out of commission. Alas, Diogenes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Hocus-pocus</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N ORDER that there may be no misunderstanding of the issues involved in the subject that follows, the following questions and answers are taken from a booklet entitled “A Catechism of Christian Doctrine, abridged from the Catechism prepared and enjoined by order of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore”. Just why the doctrine should be labeled ‘‘Christian” I don't know, unless it is for the purpose of deceiving the ignorant, the unwary and the gullible, because most of the teachings in the booklet are contrary to the Word of God, making it void and of none effect. That, no doubt, is one of the reasons why no Scriptures are cited as authority for the various statements that are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following questions and answers are taken from ‘‘Lesson Twenty-Second, on the Holy Eucharist”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. What is the Holy Eucharist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. The Holy Eucharist is the Sacrament which contains the body and blood, soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ under the appearances of bread and wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. Is Jesus Christ whole and entire both under the form of bread and under the form of wine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. Jesus Christ is whole and entire both under the form of bread and under the form of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. Did anything remain of the bread and wine after their substance had been changed into the substance of the body and blood of our Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. After the substance of the bread and wine had been changed into the substance of the body and blood of our Lord there remained only the appearances of bread and wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. What do you mean by the appearances of bread and wine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. By the appearances of bread and wine I mean the figure, the color, the taste, and whatever appears to the senses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. What is this change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of our Lord called?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. This change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of our Lord is called Transubstantiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From “Lesson Twenty-Fourth, on the Sacrifice of the Mass”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. When and where are the bread and wine changed into the body and blood of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. The bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ at the consecration in the mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. What is the mass?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. The mass is the unbloody sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. Is the mass the same sacrifice as that of the cross ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. The mass is the same sacrifice as that of the cross. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By a Former Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Q. Is there any difference between the sacrifice of the cross and the sacrifice of the mass?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A. Yes, the manner in which the sacrifice is offered is different. On the cross Christ really shed His blood and was really slain; in the mass there is no real shedding of blood and no real death, because Christ can die no more; but the sacrifice of the mass, through the separate consecration of the bread and the wine, represents His death on the cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And there you have the Catholic teachings on this subject in a nutshell, so to speak. Analyzed, they teach that the sacrifice of mass is the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">same </span><span class="font7">as that at Calvary; that it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">different;</span><span class="font7"> that Christ is sacrificed afresh every time mass is said; that He dies no more; that it is the real thing; that it is only a representation ! The fact that it is so confusing and contradictory proves it doesn’t come from God, “for God is not the author of confusion.”—1 Corinthians 14: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mass takes its name from the concluding words spoken by the deacon, or assistant, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Ite, missa est’’</span><span class="font7"> (“Go, it is over”), or, in other words, the dismissal. This formula was used at the close of a similar service in the temple of Mithra, so that, like almost everything else papal, the mass is of pagan origin, the papal system following the lead of its ancient type in disannulling the need for repentance from sins, and atonement by the blood, by instituting this unbloody “sacrifice” of “the mass”. Peter never taught or practiced anything so unchristian, and those who teach and practice this “sacrifice of the mass” make themselves successors of those whom Peter charged with the crime of killing the Prince of Life (Acts 3:15) and whom Stephen branded as His betrayers and murderers. (Acts 7: 51-53) They are children of the Devil. —John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the doctrine of transubstantiation is true, and the bread and wine are really changed into the flesh and blood of Christ, so that Christ is personally present under the appearance of bread and wine, and then sacrificed by the officiating priest, which, in the performance of the mass consists of swallowing the bread and wine, then the priest is a cannibal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regardless of whether the doctrine of transubstantiation is true or not, the priest is a cannibal just the same, the word “cannibal” being derived from the Chaldean words “Cahna”, meaning “the priests”, and “Bal”, for “Baal”, so that “Cahna-Bal” originally stood for “priests of Baal”. History shows that the priests of Baal ate part of the human sacrifice offered to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">fire-god Molech; hence the present-day meaning attached to the word &quot;cannibal”. That the priests who officiate at the mass are not priests of the Most High God, but, as has just been pointed out, priests of Baal, is conclusively proved by the apostle’s words: &quot;The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils.”—1 Corinthians 10: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the “sacrifice of the mass”, when the bread is consecrated by the priest, the Latin formula used is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Hoc est corpus meum&quot;</span><span class="font7"> (“This is my body”), which early Protestants contracted into “Hocus pocus”; and hocus-pocus it is, for the Scriptures clearly show that the doctrine of transubstantiation is without foundation, and therefore false (Hebrews 10:10,12,14; 9:25, 26; Romans 6:9; Revelation 1:18); and, being admittedly a “bloodless sacrifice”, it is without value, for “without shedding of blood [there] is no remission [of sin]”.—Hebrews 9: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Mass” is the papal system’s central rite, and “high mass” is the chief money-gathering ceremony of the day. Being an absolute farce and positively valueless, it is nothing more nor less than taking advantage of the ignorant and credulous, and extracting money from them under false pretense, and therefore racketeering of the worst sort and in the most reprehensible form. Already the Russian, Spanish and Mexican governments have put a decided crimp in the operation of this fraud on the public, and the Scriptures indicate that ere long it will be stopped altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of the “host’s” (from the Latin 7ms-</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">tia—</span><span class="font7">a sacrificial victim) being Christ, the real victim is the one who falls for such bunk as “the sacrifice of the mass”, whether low, high, or midnight mass; whether offered by Roman Catholics, Anglo-Catholics, or Greek Orthodox. The only sacrifice that is made at mass is the hard-earned cash that is wrung from the ignorant and superstitious. However, the people are going to get a “New Deal” and learn the truth about this and kindred subjects; for Christ, who cleansed the temple at His first advent, is again driving out the money changers who have turned what is supposed to be His Father’s house into a den of thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Stiff Prices for Kerosene</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE before us some advertising matter of the Commissariat of the Holy Land, Franciscan Monastery, Washington, D.C. It is an attempt to sell kerosene, and is gotten up in the form of a folder covered with gold leaf and printed with purple ink—quite a nice typographical job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The folder explains that a “sanctuary lamp” can be burned eight days and nights for one dollar and fifty cents, or one month for five dollais, three months for twelve dollars, six months for twenty dollars, or one year for thirty-five dollars. In other words, the price gradually goes down from 18|c per day for eight days and nights to about 9}c per day for steady customers. But even at that, the price is too high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A “sanctuary lamp” or vigil light is a diminutive thing and takes very little oil. A half-pint would run one of them straight through for 24 hours without any trouble at all, and if the lamp were kept blazing away day and night for 365 days the most oil that could be crowded through it would not exceed 24 gallons. Around Brooklyn here one can get all the kerosene one wants at 15c a gallon, and, if regularly in the kerosene business, ought to be able to shade the price considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now anybody can see that 24 gallons of kerosene would be only $3.60, at the most, and to charge customers $35.00 for something that costs barely a tenth of that amount is not fair, and the eight-day rate of double that amount is downright robbery. We plead with the brethren in the kerosene business to be more reasonable in their charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, it will be argued that there is an expense for wicks; but one dollar’s worth of wicks would run one of those little vigil lamps a good deal more than a year. Of that we feel certain. It will further be argued that there is some expense for lamps and chimneys (not sure about the chimneys); and there is the labor of filling and wiping the lamps and trimming the wicks, and, anyway, nobody should suppose that anybody is in the kerosene business for his health. But the point we are getting at is that even then the price is too high, and if the Commissariat really wants to do a good business it should buy its kerosene at wholesale and cut prices to the bone. In these hard times, if you want to sell kerosene you must keep prices down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE SERIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of Judge Rutherford’s five-minute talks on the Bible is continued on this page. These helpful and illuminating talks are being received with much appreciation. They review important issues and discuss in a pointed and straightforward manner questions of deep significance but which are generally evaded by those who represent themselves as the teachers of the people. Another of these splendid talks will appear on the corresponding page of the next issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Whose Servant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">T A GREAT assembly of Christian people held at Los Angeles on the 25th day of March, 1934, the following </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Protest</span><span class="font7"> was unanimously adopted and was at the same time broadcast over a coast-to-coast network of radio stations, which </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Protest</span><span class="font7"> is in these words, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For many years Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, unitedly working under the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, have engaged in bearing testimony to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God. During the past year the German government without cause or excuse has wrongfully seized, confiscated and destroyed the Bibles, song books, furniture and other property of these faithful Christians, prohibited them to meet together and worship God according to His commandments, and has cruelly persecuted and imprisoned many of them, and, like Pharaoh of old, that government has wickedly opposed Jehovah and defamed His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Therefore we, their brethren, as followers of Christ Jesus, and servants of Jehovah, do earnestly and vigorously protest against such unwarranted treatment of Christians by the German ruling power, and we call upon all true Christians and all fair-minded people throughout the earth, whether Jews or Gentiles, to join in this vigorous protest and demand that Jehovah’s witnesses shall, without let or hindrance on the part of the German government or others, be permitted to go on in their worship and service of Jehovah God in the manner which He has commanded, and w<sup>y</sup>e register our protest by declaring against Satan and all such oppression and by taking our stand on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom and His people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day is drawing near when Satan and all who serve him shall be destroyed by Christ at the command of Jehovah. Information and warning is now brought to the people, that they may determine whom they wish to serve. All may take the Bible and the facts which are well known and determine thereby what is the proper course to pursue. All persons, therefore, who desire to see righteousness prevail and who wish to live in peace and happiness forever must take their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order for anyone to become the servant of God, he does not need to join some organization ; but the proper way is for each person to consecrate himself to Jehovah, thereby agreeing to serve God and His kingdom. Having taken such step, then you should study the Bible and the helps which are provided for the understanding of the Scriptures. In this manner you become teachable and learn the right way to go. Then you should do what is right unto all persons ; which means to learn righteousness. In harmony with this Jehovah’s prophet wrote, and his words now apply to the people of good will on earth, which words are, to wit: ‘Before the wrath of God come upon the wicked world, seek meekness and seek righteousness, and it may be that you shall be hid and protected in the day of great trouble.’ There is only one place of safety, and that is on the side of Jehovah God. Let all persons be free to believe what they will, but if you desire to live and be happy, put yourself on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom, become His servant and serve Him faithfully and truly. Do not follow the teachings of men, but follow the teachings of God’s word of truth as set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">[The foregoing talk is one of a series of eighteen reproduced on a set of nine phonographic records. These are being distributed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Brooklyn, N. Y. They are designed for use in connection with an ordinary phonograph and are run at the usual speed of 78 revolutions per minute. These records are being widely used in homes and in small gatherings and have aroused much interest and thoughtful discussion. Inquiries concerning the records should be addressed to the Watch Tower and not to The Golden Age, as has been done in some instances.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What and Where Is the Corona? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By C. W. Tennant (Connecticut)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7"> HAVE thought you would he interested in an astronomical discovery that I made during the total eclipse of the sun in January, 1925. This discovery showed the corona to be at the moon, and not at the sun, as has been commonly taught in the old school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let me here state that we must change our thought regarding the sun as being a huge ball of combustion with flaming hydrogen streamers darting out into space some 200,000 miles which we see as the corona during an eclipse. This view we must change, I say, and consider the sun as a huge center of electric energy, throwing its huge flame earthward. This flame, on its journey to earth, loses its visibility to our eye on the way, but continues its journey as a beam of powerful but unseen energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So far, so good; and now for the total eclipse of the sun when our moon slides over its face. When the moon has reached this beam of energy from the sun to the earth the moon begins to plow into the stream of electric and magnetic energy from sun to earth, and continues to do so until the moon reaches the point of complete totality. At this instant the '’flicker” is caused by the energy of the sun making a few jumps past the moon's edge to the earth. Immediately at the termination of this “flicker”, which shows that totality has been reached, the corona bursts into instant view from all sides of the moon at once, this corona being caused by the statical glow of the sun's energy as it darts past the edge of the moon to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The use of instruments at such a time will simply trick the observer, as a camera can only register light and shade without giving time valuations or the important factor of perspective. For an illustration, a lantern on a hill half a mile away could easily be taken for a star by the camera at night. We are now at the door of some new factors for careful observation by the astronomer. We know that a river has a current and that in many places in the ocean there are currents. Ships on encountering these currents are acted upon by them and the ships are deflected. In like manner, when the moon in space encounters this stream of energy from sun to earth, its action upon the moon will be similar to the action upon a ship in the water when encountered by a flowing body of water. Do we not find here an explanation for the moon’s libration (rocking motion) as it enters this stream of energy? Can this not also explain the moon’s swinging motion north and south of the equator?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Could it not also give the moon its bouncing motion up and down, now near the earth and on the rebound, farther away ? There is strong evidence that such is the case; and all lovers of the science should give these points careful investigation or observation. Use no instruments : the naked eye is perfectly safe when the eclipse has reached a point of 99-percent totality; and, by careful observation as it advances, the above will be made plain. This is one of the greatest discoveries in modern times, and comes to us in God's due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A comet shows us the action of the sun's energy by the long streaming tail cast into space; but with us and the moon, we are directly behind the moon and are looking right up into the tail of the moon, as it were, which spreads out fan-like towards us, like a stream of water darting off from a ball.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have remained silent these several years on this discovery, for I have found very little encouragement for any discovery that did not check up with the old school’s teachings, and, remembering the fate of Galileo, I have felt it best to lie quite low in this “brainy age”, but am now taking the chance of safe handling by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> and its readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Russian Jumps Five Miles</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpiIE world's record for a jump is held by ■I- Nikolai Evdokimoff, of Petrograd, who jumped from an airplane at 26,575 feet, his one hundredth jump in three years. He did not open his parachute until within 650 feet of the earth. The descent was made in 142 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cadman Is Half Right</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HENEVER the Reverend Cadman is even half right on anything we feel that it should be mentioned. He is reported as saying that the clergy are as great liabilities as they are assets. They are indeed great liabilities, but not assets at all.

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is something to think about in each of the following letters, one in answer to the other, which appeared of late in the correspondence columns of one of the New York city newspapers. We reprint these letters just as they appeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CHICKENS HOME TO ROOST</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Queens: Are you Americans picking on the foreigner nowadays because so many of you are out of work and money? Well, who is to blame? You Americans welcomed us to do your dirty work. Why do all gas, electric and telephone companies employ Italians to do the digging ? Because ’twas too low for Americans. Why are practically all butchers and bakers German? Because twelve to fourteen hours a day was too much like work. Why do most all restaurants employ foreigners? Because they smell too much like work for an American. American girls couldn’t ruin their lovely hands by doing housework, so the Swedes and the Irish got a monopoly on that. All you boys and girls were interested in was a helluva good time with little work and lots of pay. And you didn’t feel sorry for the foreigner, either. Nope, you were the brains and we were the mugs. So take it on the chin now, if you are real game Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GAME DUTCHMAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BLAMING THE FOREIGNER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Queens: I'll bet you would sell your soul for a dime, Game Dutchman. Why is European scum given preference for jobs in America over Americans ? Simply because they’ll work for seum prices. An American is entitled to your job, but an American wouldn't stoop to work your hours at your wages. And your wagos wouldn’t be so low if it weren’t for cheap foreigners like you. Foreign employers and foreign workers have ruined our trade unions by cheap contracts and cheap workers. Dutch Schultz, Al Capone, etc., all foreign racketeers, have ruined America. Cheap foreign goods have ruined our industries and closed our factories. I’m for the exclusion of foreign riffraff from this country. Then America could take care of her self-respecting Americans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(By S. M. Erickson)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">YOUNG man was talking the other day about conditions in the rural district. As you know, most of the land is owned by large landholders and leased to tenants under pretty hard conditions. This young fellow stated, “The landowner looks on the tenant as an enemy, and the tenant thinks of the owner as an enemy.” Perhaps an outside distraction is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vice is one of the great problems in Japan. Some progress against licensed vice is being made. During the last forty years eleven provinces have voted to abolish licensed quarters. It has also become a bit easier for women to secure freedom from the quarters. It is reported that one girl was freed in two minutes, just the time it took for the police to sign the papers ; but that attitude is not very general yet. The whole land must be enlightened in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Yamagata province a certain block of land had been opened and placed on the market for sale. The villagers desired to buy the land, but could not raise the required sum of money. They consulted together and decided to sell their own daughters, 57 of them, into the vice quarters and then buy the land. Little has been made of this in the press, showing that public opinion is not awake to the matter yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The crops in the north were very poor. They got less than one-third of the usual harvest. The famine district is doubling the number of girls being sold to the licensed quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Morning, noon, and night the bugles are blowing. The students of high-school grade and college grade are training hard. In the country the lads drill at night. The towns have been decorated to see the regular conscripts off. The tiny tots are playing soldier. Every ablebodied man knows something about a gun. Yes, they need several disarmament conventions.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>British Farmers Love to Be Robbed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font7">OR patient, uncomplaining sufferance of thieves, the British farmers are the outside limit. It is well known to every reader of what is called the “New Testament” that there is not a hint in it of the support of “religion” by any tithing arrangement. Required of the Jew, under the law, it ceased for them and for all when Christ was nailed to the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A mere handful of farmers in Great Britain have to provide £3,000,000 annually for the support of the Church of England, regardless of whether they “belong” to that church or not. The tithe, which for the past one hundred years has been payable in cash, often amounts to six to nine shillings per acre per annum and is a first charge upon the land. In other words, the clergy, the hypocrites, get theirs whether the farmer makes enough to break even or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Kentish farmer, charged with an annual tithing rate of 18s. per acre, stated to the court that during the last seven years he had lost more than £3,000 in the agricultural business; the court ordered him to pay at the rate of £3 per month. A man has to have a pretty good income to pay £3 a month for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Ecclesiastical Commissioners are reputed to be the richest corporate body in Great Britain. The money that comes to them is as purely graft as is the money that comes to the Roman Catholic church for masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Highwaymen are notoriously unjust in their robberies. It is that way with the lazy loafers that go to make up the clergy of the Church of England. It may happen that in the ease of two houses occupying similar space, and with the same rating, one is paying five times as much in tithes as the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Wallingford district there is waterlogged land upon which the owner pays 10s. 6d. per acre annually, yet the land is worth nothing, being so soft that it will not bear the weight of a mowing machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A protesting farmer who appeared before the minister of agriculture said: “At the present time I have to pay out £53 19s. 7d. to Queen Anne’s Bounty for the vicar (annually), I have to pay £203 12s. 4d. to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and another charge of £20 for vicar’s stipend; so you see what I have to pay on my farm of 540 acres.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another farmer on the same occasion said: “We have a charge in our county of £220,000 per annum, mostly ecclesiastical tithe, in return for which no special service is rendered to the agricultural industry. It is equivalent to between 3s. and 4s. per week on every agricultural worker’s wage in the county. I cannot imagine any other industry tolerating such a position. These men who are agricultural workers give of their best to the industry in return for what they receive from it, but, owing to the fact that tithe is a first charge on the land, when distress comes along these men have to be discharged or have their wages reduced. We have in effect the national church, intended to serve the whole community, literally riding on the back of a small portion of the community.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within the past winter the farmers all over England are beginning to indicate that they are getting tired of carrying around these parasites, yet they are remarkably moderate in their protests and demands. The majority merely ask that the tithes be cut down to a place where they can pay them. They do not seem to discern that the whole thing is an out-and-out robbery by the most unprincipled, laziest, most good-for-nothing element in the country, the clergy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">VITHEN crossing sandy tracts and patches, ’ ’ deserts, dry river beds, etc., the car sometimes gets caught in the loose sand. The more you accelerate, the deeper the rear wheels go into the sand. If you get into this predicament simply deflate the back tires. The trouble is, the tires, being so highly inflated, present an almost solid wheel to the sand, and the faster they revolve, the deeper they cut into it. In deflating the tires a flat surface is produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When pioneering, in the course of the thousands of miles traversed, the above proved to be of untold value. Running on a usual pressure at the back of 40 pounds, we would deflate to about 20 pounds on such occasions. Do not deflate too much, as the rims are liable to cut the inner tubes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">FRIEND calls attention to comments from the 1928 edition of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Methodist Evangel,</span><span class="font7"> by Dr. 0. E. Goddard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Describing the conditions prior to the birth of Methodism the author says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It was the habit of the clergy to change from Roman Catholic to Protestant and from Protestant to Roman Catholic accordingly as the government was Roman Catholic or Protestant. It is said that when Mary, Queen of Scots, changed the government from Protestant to Roman Catholic, more than nine thousand of the clergy similarly changed without losing a day’s pay.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next, he points out the wretched conditions when the Wesleys came on the scene:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The city clergy were worldly, and the country clergy ignorant. The preachers in the large churches spent their time in sports, employing a curate to go through a form of worship for the straggling few that came to church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He quoted from Blackstone, who said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I heard all the leading preachers of London, and could not tell whether they were Buddhists, Jews, or Christians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then he refers to the persecutions of the early Methodists:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Methodists were without money, social prestige, political influence, or ecclesiastical backing. People with social ambitions dared not identify themselves with these fanatics. One by one the pulpits were closed to Wesley. He was forced to the commons and the fields.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, he gives a splendid summary of conditions that have at last developed among the modern Methodist churches which have climbed to power and can be classed among the ‘big trees’. The author says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The mechanics have loomed so large that the dynamics are sometimes lost sight of. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The doctor offers this as a criticism of the denomination, yet he is proud of the place in the sun that his chosen denomination holds, for he says in comparing it with other churches:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“These churches have not won the large place that Methodism has, nor exerted the power in the world of affairs that is so manifest in the work of worldwide Methodism.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>We Wonder About Tommy’s Mama</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE a letter signed “Tommy”. The style of penmanship and composition is that of a man at least fifty years of age; and we have no doubt the writer was that old -when, from the Capuchin Franciscan Fathers, Home for Poor Boys, Castlegate Avenue, South Hills Branch, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he sent out an undated letter and in it said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“My dear Friend: I am just a little fellow and so you will know how I look I enclose my picture. Father Dennis said I could write to you. lie has charge of us boys here at the Home and he is terribly worried. That’s what I want to tell you about. If he cannot get some money he is afraid he will have to close the Home and send us away. My mama went to heaven and left me all alone. Father Dennis and the Sisters take care of me and there are lots of other little boys here too who have no mamas. I get awful lonesome sometimes for my mama but Father Dennis is so good to us I love it here. When I heard him say he might have to send us away I cried a lot. I don’t want to go away from here. If you send him some money he won’t have to send us away. Maybe you could send a dollar. I would be glad if you could help Father Dennis so he don’t have to close the Home. Won’t you please help us little fellows so we can stay here and learn to be good Catholic boys?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have no doubt that “Father” Dennis is after the dollars, all of them he can get; that does not perplex us. We do not wonder that Tommy’s mother is dead; she had probably lived out her allotted threescore and ten years. But we do wonder how Tommy could aspire to be a good Catholic and suppose for one minute that his mother had gone to heaven and not to “purgatory”. But perhaps his mother was a nun, and in that case we could understand it. And that is probably the explanation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font7">N DECEMBER 28, 1933, Ambrose Ratti, of Vatican City, addressing some Asiatic students who had come on a pilgrimage to Rome, said: “Christ is a Roman inasmuch as from Rome has gone forth the light that has illuminated the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to John’s epistle, Jesus said, “I am the light of the world”; and since Jesus himself was never in Rome, and, furthermore, as it was the Romans, at the instigation of the clergy, who crucified Him, something seems not to fit in properly. However, since Ratti and his predecessors have all claimed infallibility, notwithstanding having repeatedly contradicted one another, and since the apostle never made such claim for himself, it must surely be that he made a mistake, unless Jesus himself did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now we understand why the proportion of illiterates over ten years of age is 54 percent in Catholic countries, whereas it is only 2.6 percent in Protestant countries.

<p><span class="font5">Catholics seldom inquire about the religious affiliations of those with whom they do business. Nor should they. Ordinarily, unless for some special reason, goods should be purchased in the field of open competition on the basis of quality and price and the customer's need. There are occasions, however, when Catholics have a right to deny certain individuals the privilege of even soliciting their business. One such case came to our attention the other day. The Midland Chemical Laboratories of Dubuque, Iowa, manufacture soap and other cleansing compounds which they sell to Catholic institutions, even going so far as to reserve space for exhibits at the conventions of the Catholic Hospital Association of the United States and Canada. At the same time, according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Western Watchman, </span><span class="font5">the president of that company, Mr. L. 0. Hillyard, is describing himself on business stationery as one of the sponsors of what he calls the ‘‘Rutherford educational program”. If the directors ami stockholders of the Midland Chemical Laboratories are satisfied to allow their two-sided president to continue his present actirities, they are free to do so. They can hardly object, however, if Catholic buyers refuse in the future to purchase goods of an organization, part of the profits of which go into financing the activities of an anti-Catholic campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Hillyard finds this good advertising. He says lie finds from actual experience that every time he loses a barrel order from a Catholic institution the Lord gives him ten more from somewhere else.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font7">OME years ago, while a resident of Long Beach, California, and a member of the South M.E. church, 1 had my little part in a certain money-making program for some church enterprise (payment of a debt or something) ; and since 1 have come to a knowledge of tiie truth, as I reflect back, it is all so very ridiculous that I think to tell you of it. It is typical of the various means that churchianity resorts to to raise money for her running expenses. My object in ‘‘confessing” this now is to help others who are yet engaging in similar things for similar purposes, and who are misled into thinking that what they are doing is serving the Lord, whereas it is merely helping to support an institution or organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A commercial concern was enterprising enough to see an expansion of its business by working through women’s organizations in churches, and put on the program, which consisted largely in gathering labels from various kinds of staple goods in paper cartons and on cans, paying money for certain big numbers of labels turned in (a clever scheme of advertising the products). The returns in increased sales far more than offset the expenditure for old labels turned in. The crux of the whole thing was the means to which we laborers resorted to secure old labels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It sounds like a fairy tale now, but I walked up and down alleys many mornings for blocks, looking for the coveted labels in old rubbish barrels and boxes, and was always well rewarded, as, of course, others were. Finally, when we had pretty well covered the town, leaving many bare and unlabeled cans in our wake, we sought other fertile fields. We labored first at the Long Beach city dump: and when that field had been covered we reached out and took in more territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With several carloads of workers, aird taking along our lunches, we worked for days on the Los Angeles city dump, which covered several acres. In the meantime all the workers were making a point to purchase those special brands of goods, and telling their neighbors about them, and to this day, though that was seventeen years ago, that clever advertising scheme made such an impression on my mind that I never see those labels on shelves or on old empty cans or cartons that I do not recognize them at once. This is merely one of many ways that Jezebel has of keeping herself going.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Anglo-Israel versus Israel of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N A MANIFESTO, published and sent out in 1931 by the General Council of the British-Israel-World Federation, London, England, there are set forth what are called “links in the development of the divine plan of ‘The Kingdom—’ ”, and under “Link XI” it is stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The ‘Captivity’ Treks to Britain. About the third century B.C. the body of Israel people, who since the Captivity had dwelt about the Black and Caspian Seas, east of the boundaries of the Roman Empire, were dislodged by the irruption of the Huns and driven over the Danube into the Roman Empire. They fought their way through Europe as Goths, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, forming settlements here and there in Europe. The stream of migration, having reached the shores of the North Sea, made its way into Britain. They came as Saxons, Jutes, Danes, and bearing many other names, as Anglo-Saxons bear many names today. They were bands of the Israel people, shepherded by God according to promise and prophecy into a land of their own, this British or Covenant land, from which they should move no more. Last of all came the Benjamite Normans (A.D. 1066), who had separated from the Jews at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in A.D. 70. By the benign influence of the Gospel, and by the events of history, they were fused into the one Celto-Saxon people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under “Link XIII” the same Manifesto states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Empire and the United States: With 1799 came the last year of the seven times of punishment meted out under Divine Law to Israel-Britain. Seven times equals 2,520 years. This period began when Israel was carried into captivity in 721 B.C. and ended in A.D. 1799. 1801 was the beginning of the most wonderful nineteenth century. The Anglo-Saxon people had now increased to about sixteen millions. Britain, the Motherland, now produced two mighty branches: The United States of America and the beginnings of the British Empire. Britain was the stem of a ‘Y’; the United States formed one branch of the ‘ Y ’, and the Empire the other branch. Treaties following the wars which ended in Trafalgar and Waterloo recognised the independence of the United States; and confirmed or ceded to Britain the West Indies, Newfoundland, Canada, Gibraltar, Cape of Good Hope, Bombay, and our ships •went out and took possession of New Zealand and Australia. . . . The miracle of the United States is surpassed only by the miracle of the British Empire, now coming to be known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under “Link XIV” it is boldly stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Multiply the influence of the race, and then Anglo-Saxon civilisation will command the peace and </span><span class="font4">ENSURE THE PROSPERITY OF THE WORLD. </span><span class="font6">There will never be another world war after Anglo-Saxon unification takes place, and international economic war will then become a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In “Link XV” is given “the final stage of the plan”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>The “Ten Lost Tribes”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Thus are the view's of those who claim that the Anglo-Saxons are the Israel of promise, in the Holy Scriptures. Briefly stated, they claim that the Anglo-Saxons, the people of the United States, etc., are the descendants of the ten tribes of Israel which separated from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, after Solomon’s death, and which are often termed “the ten lost tribes”; because, after the captivity (of the entire twelve tribes) in Babylon, the ten tribes never reestablished themselves in the land of Canaan, as “Israel”, but became scattered as tribes and as individuals among the various nations. The Anglo-Israelites claim they can trace their journey toward Great Britain, and that the greatness and influence of the English-speaking peoples of the world are traceable to the fact that they belong to Israel, and are inheriting the promises made to Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To this the answer must be: Some of the evidences offered in proof that they are of the “lost tribes” seem far from strong; but if we should admit all they claim in this, it would not prove their position, that the greatness and influence of the Anglo-Saxon race are attributable to their being Israelites by natural generation, any more than to their being “lost”. Their greatness is attributable apparently to their freedom and intelligence, and not to their being “lost”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that the ten tribes strayed away from the two other tribes of the house of Israel is not to their credit, but otherwise. It is an evidence that they were disposed to reject God’s promises; it is a sign of infidelity, of unbelief; for they well knew that God had predicted that the Lawgiver, the Savior, the Deliverer, the King, in whom and by whom the promises were to be fulfilled, was to come out of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Judah.</span><span class="font7"> (Genesis 49:10) The tribe of Benjamin was therefore the only tribe aside from Judah which, at the time of the revolt of the ten tribes, manifested faith in God’s promises. But at the time of the return of the remnant of Israel from the Babylonian captivity not all who came back were of these two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, even though those who showed their continued faith in God and His promises by returning to the land of Palestine were mostly of those two tribes. Among them were some from the various tribes, who loved the Lord and sought Him with repentance, still relying on His promises. (Note that Anna, the prophetess, who lived to see the babe Jesus, was of the tribe of Asher, and not of Judah or Benjamin.—Luke 2:36.) However, a vast majority of the ten tribes, as well as of the two tribes, did not avail themselves of the opportunity to return to the land of promise, preferring Babylon and other lands, many of them having fallen into idolatry and lost their respect for God’s promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Be it remembered that but a few of those who returned to their land under the lead of Ezra, and none of those who returned under Nehemiah, were of those who had been taken captive, the vast majority having died years before in Babylon. These were their children, in whose hearts the faith of their fathers still burned, who still hoped for the blessings and honors promised of the Lord. Thus the little band of less than fifty thousand that returned were about all the Israelites then remaining, of all the tribes, who by the act of returning to the land of promise showed that they still held to the faith of Abraham. It was to the descendants of these faithful ones sifted out of all the tribes of Israel and all called “Jews” (Judeans) after the royal tribe of Judah, that our Lord Jesus presented Himself and the Kingdom, A.D. 33.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Twelve, Not Two, Tribes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Our Lord referred to them as Israel, and not as a part of Israel, nor as Judah merely. He speaks of even those who had clung to the promises, and to each other, as the “lost sheep of the house of Israel”, in that they had wandered far from the truth, after the traditions of false shepherds who had led them in their own way and not as God directed. He says: “I am not sent but [except] to the lost sheep of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">house of Israel.”</span><span class="font7"> (Matthew 15:24) To the house of Israel, consequently, His ministry was confined, in harmony with the foregoing, showing that the Jews of His day were the only recognized representatives of the “house of Israel”. The terms “all the house of Israel”, “our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">tivelve </span><span class="font7">tribes instantly serving God,” and many similar expressions of our Lord ami the apostles indicate this fact. (Acts 2: 36; 26: 7) And it will be remembered that our Lord, in connection with this statement that His ministry was to Israel, forbade His disciples’ going to any outside the Jews of Palestine: “Go not into the way of the Gentiles [where the so-called Ten lost tribes’ would be], and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel [representatives of all of which must therefore have been in Palestine, and not Ten lost tribes’ being outside and unrepresented in Palestine].”—Matthew 10:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Notice also how the apostles used the word “Israel”, and not “Judah”, when speaking of those who were living at that time in Palestine. Peter, speaking at Pentecost to those then “dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven”, said: “Ye men of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Israel,</span><span class="font7"> hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth ... ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.” (Acts 2:5,22,23) Later, at Herod’s temple, Peter “answered unto the people, Ye men of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Israel,</span><span class="font7"> why marvel ye at this?” (Acts 3:12) (See also Acts 5:35; 13:16; 21: 28.) Notice, too, how Paul applies the words of Isaiah concerning the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">remnant</span><span class="font7"> of Israel to the comparatively few who received the gospel of God’s kingdom, at Romans 9: 4, 27, 29, 31-33; 10:1-4; and 11:1,7-15,25, and how he speaks of all the rest as stumbling and being blinded: “But Israel [not merely Judah and Benjamin], which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone [Christ Jesus]; as it is written [in Isaiah’s prophecy], Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence ; and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.” (Romans 9:31-33) “What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election [the remnant who became of God’s elect ones] hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.”—Romans 11: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because God had not cast away this elect remnant of Israel Paul wrote: “I say then, Hath God cast away his [faithful and believing] people? God forbid. For I [who am a member of the elect remnant of Israel] also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people [the remnant thereof].” To prove that Jehovah God foreknew there would be a remnant of Israel Paul continues: “Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias [Elijah] ? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. [And it must be remembered that Elijah worked mainly among the ten tribes of Israel that revolted from Judah.] But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.”—Romans 11:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few days before Jesus was crucified He rode into Jerusalem, offering Himself as King to the Israelites, and was rejected. Then and there He said to them: “Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.” (Matthew 23: 38) There the Jews, or Israelites, as a nation were cast away; but there was a remnant of them that remained faithful, and this remnant remaining faithful became “children of the promise”. “They which are the children of the flesh [such as Anglo-Israelites claim to be], these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.” (Romans 9:8) The nation of Israel had failed to obtain the great privilege of being Jehovah’s witnesses, but those of the Jews who continued faithful, and hence become a part of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">spiritual</span><span class="font7"> house of Israel, did by election obtain that favor. “For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in the spirit,</span><span class="font7"> and not in the letter.” (Romans 2:28,29) Hence Paul says: “Behold Israel after the flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18), and then adds: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Israel of God.&quot;—</span><span class="font7">Galatians 6:15,16.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>People for His Name</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The gospel was not taken to anyone except natural Israelites until the apostle Peter took it to Cornelius the Roman centurion. (Acts 10) It was after that that the apostles held a meeting in Jerusalem to determine why the gospel had been taken to the Gentiles, or non-Jews, and it was on that occasion that James said: “Men and brethren, hearken unto me: Simeon [Peter] hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a people for his name.”</span><span class="font7"> (Acts 15:13,14) On that occasion Paul and Barnabas testified that God had wrought miracles and wonders among the Gentiles by them. (Acts 15:12,15) Paul was made an apostle especially to the Gentiles. After the gospel went to the Gentiles an opportunity was open to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jews</span><span class="font7"> and Gentiles alike, and not alone to natural Israelites. Paul emphasizes the fact that the opportunity of becoming a 'people for Jehovah’s name’ was a great favor from God to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Romans, chapter 11, Paul says in substance : ‘The casting away of the nation of natural Israel opened the way for those of the world to become reconciled to God, including all </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">individual</span><span class="font7"> Israelites who cease their unbelief; and, that being true, what would be the effect to those individual Israelites who would now accept Jesus Christ and devote themselves wholly to God?’ He answers his own question, that the reception would be for them “life from the dead”. (Vs. 15) He then warns the Gentiles not to boast because favor has come to them, but to fear. The Gentiles doubtless were inclined to boast; hence Paul says: “Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off; and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches [Israelites after the flesh], take heed lest he also spare not thee.”—Verses 19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul emphasizes that only by faithfulness to God and Christ Jesus would anyone have the guarantee of safety. He tells the Gentiles that God is able to bring the fleshly Israelites into the new covenant if they would believe and obey Him. The time had come for the gospel to go to the Gentiles, and those who were selected were not considered from the standpoint of flesh, but entirely from the fact that they were spiritual, that is to say, that they had accepted Christ Jesus and devoted themselves wholly to God. God was from that time forward making no distinction between Jew and Gentile as far as flesh is concerned. “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3: 28) Hence fleshly descent from the so-called “lost ten tribes of Israel” makes no difference with Jehovah God and deserves and brings no special favor from Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because the favor had come to the Gentiles and the opportunity had been given them to become a people for Jehovah, that did not mean that all the Jews, or Israelites, were or would be included for the mere reason that they were the natural descendants of Abraham. On the contrary, the Israelites after the flesh and the Gentiles now stood on a common level, and whether a man was a natural Israelite or a Gentile, bond or free, if he devoted himself wholly to God by faith in the blood of Christ Jesus he might become one of the promised seed. The time must come when there would come out of God’s organization (Zion) the Deliverer, and that time came when Christ Jesus appeared for judgment at the spiritual temple of God, in A.D. 1918, as prophecy and modern facts show; and it was at that time that the prophecy applies: “There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Note the apostle says: “And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.” (Romans 11: 26) The apostle does not here mean “Israel after the flesh”, including the “lost ten tribes”, but means the “Israel of God”, spiritual Israel. It is at the time of the Deliverer Christ Jesus’ coming out from Zion, God’s organization, that ungodliness is taken away from all spiritual Israelites so that then “all Israel”, that is to say, spiritual Israel, shall be saved. The One coming out of Zion, the Deliverer, is Christ Jesus, and it is He that turns away ungodliness “from Jacob”, that is to say, from the people taken out for Jehovah’s name. It is then that all spiritual Israel are delivered, being gathered unto God as a people for himself and separate and distinct from all the nations of the world, including “Christendom”. The argument of the apostle Paul clearly appears to apply, not to Israel after the flesh, but to the salvation of Israel after the spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, then, oven if it could be demonstrated that the Anglo-Saxon peoples were part of the “ten lost tribes”, it is clearly to be seen that no favor could have come to them upon that score, under the covenant made with Israel after the flesh by their mediator Moses. Such “lost tribes” deserted the said covenant with fleshly Israel and became idolaters, unbelievers, and also to them would apply Jesus’ words of rejection: “Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.” (Matthew 23:38) Fleshly Israel failing to produce the full number of the “people for his [Jehovah’s] name”, the law covenant with them failed and waxed old and passed away. “For finding fault with them [fleshly Israel], he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers [including fathers of the ten tribes] in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. ... In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decay-eth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.” ■—Hebrews 8: 8-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By His death Christ Jesus put an end to the ordinances of the old covenant relating to fleshly Israel (including the ten tribes), nailing them to His tree: “blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it [the handwriting] out of the way, nailing it to his cross.” (Colossians 2:14) The nation of Israel after the flesh had proved unfaithful to the law covenant, and therefore unworthy that the new covenant be made with that nation. The fleshly Israelites (except the faithful remnant of all tribes) were cast off, and at that moment the old law covenant with them ended and hence became old. Immediately following this God made the new covenant with Christ Jesus. In behalf of whom? The answer is, the entire house of spiritual Israel, that is to say, all those begotten by the holy spirit of Jehovah as His spiritual children. This new covenant is not with or in behalf of any of the natural descendants of Jacob, but in behalf of all who become righteous by faith in Christ Jesus. (Romans 3: 22) “For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek [nonJew] ; for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” (Romans 10:12,13) “For he [Christ Jesus] is our peace, who hath made both [Israelite and non-Jew who become true believers] one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances [of the old law covenant]; for to make in himself of twain [Israelite and Gentile] one new man, so making peace; and that he [as Mediator] might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity [the old law covenant] thereby.”—Ephesians 2:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus it is manifest that none of the blessings of the old and abolished law covenant with Israel after the flesh could be claimed by the “ten lost tribes” or by Anglo-Israelites on the basis of natural or fleshly descent from the fathers of the ten tribes of Israel after the flesh. Note also the actual present-day condition of “the Empire and the United States” as to lawlessness, ignorance of Jehovah God, ungodliness, worldliness, militarism, materialism, and greedy commercialism, etc., and compare such condition with God’s promised provision respecting the new covenant which superseded the abolished law covenant: “This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of [spiritual] Israel: After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font7"> [JEHOVAH]: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” (Jeremiah 31: 33, 34) The facts prove beyond denial that the new covenant does not apply to the Anglo-Saxon world or “the Empire and the United States” and has not been, and is not being, fulfilled toward them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The boast, therefore, that “the miracle of the United States is surpassed only by the miracle of the British empire, now coming to be known as the British Commonwealth of Nations”, must be accounted for on a basis other than as being the result of Jehovah God’s favor and covenant relationship with Him. If not from Jehovah God, it must be from His enemy. “The Empire and the United States” are a part of this world, and “know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God”. (James 4:4) To the Anglo-Saxon world element has “the devil . . . shewed ... all the kingdoms of the world . . . And the devil said unto [them], All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be thine”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do the “miracle of the United States” and “miracle of the British Empire” indicate that they refused the Devil’s proposal? Prophecy answers from aforetime: “And the dragon [that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan] gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns [‘two mighty branches’—‘the Empire and the United States’] like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,... saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image [the League of Nations] to the beast, . . . And he [‘the Empire and the United States’] had power to give life unto the image of the beast [the League], that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.” (Revelation 13:2,11-15) The true “Israel of God”, spiritual Israel, has become the “people for his name”, or Jehovah’s witnesses, but the Anglo-Saxon world element, “the Empire and the United States,” persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses, His covenant people today, and opposes these witnesses in their world-wide proclamation of the kingdom of Jehovah God by His Son Christ Jesus the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Modern Torture Chamber: Shall It Be Abolished? and How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By A. E. Ferries (Florida)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font7">WRITING on this subject it can only be •*- in the same spirit that actuated the great prophet when he said, “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens!” and, “Cry aloud, spare not.” (Isaiah64:l;58:l) I cannot regard this matter with complacent apathy. This article was inspired by a paragraph in Judge Rutherford’s sermon “Is Hell Hot?”. An exposition often makes a statement giving much food for thought along lines not embraced in his subject. The statement instanced is this: “If the executioner of the most depraved criminal would torture that cr</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">imin</span><span class="font7">al for one day with a red-hot iron, he would thereafter be shunned and despised by every honest man of the land.” Now readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> should be pretty well informed of the evils constantly going on, not alone in the ecclesiastical “hell”, but all over this beautiful earth that in the beginning was an expression of God’s ideal of perfection. All current literature daily gives details of some atrocity being perpetrated in this Devil’s regime, thousands of which parallel torturing a person with a hot iron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instances in a recent issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">state that among boys and girls fifteen to nineteen years of age employed in certain mills the death rate was double that among others not so employed. What unnecessary suffering do they endure, not only for a single day, until, gradually worn out by suffering, death relieves them! Puerto Rico is poor and sick. The death rate is four and a half times what it is in the United States. Poverty and a high death rate always go hand in hand. Can you imagine what it means, or the suffering that is entailed, by being sick and hungry in unsanitary conditions, with insects torturing you, and this in heat that is almost comparable to “hell” accelerating the fever? and what it means to watch in compulsory helplessness your loved ones so suffer from preventable cause and from lack of access to the very things their labor and yours have produced ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ten million people starved to death in China last year. As a medium of torture, has the hot iron many advantages over slow starvation? Poverty causes death of over fifteen thousand babies annually in the U. S. A. An individual who would slay ten babies would be lynched. Who or what can be indicted on this charge ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every hour in every day hundreds of thousands of old people, most of them prematurely, who have done their share in producing all the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• • rug) •-------------------------------— — — </span><span class="font7">stupendous wealth, magnificence and splendor of the world, suffering in mind and body the “torture of Hades” from poverty. What kind of conscience can realize with indifference that at this present moment millions of people are suffering from preventable cause the equivalent of being tortured with a red-hot iron? Can any one of us shirk our share of the responsibility? Will God accept our excuses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do you read detective stories? How do you like the sport of man-hunting? The tortures inflicted in asylums and penal institutions? The suffering of natives in the British Congo? How can preachers howling for law enforcement reconcile their attitude with the “Good News of Jesus”, who came to set the captives free? Did you ever contemplate how much suffering you would endure before committing suicide? How many who love life as much as you are driven to this every year? Fifty-nine in one day in New York, I read in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> men who knew and appreciated the pleasure of life, committed suicide over the late slump in the stock market. Such occurrences clearly show there is no security in riches. This is a system where “stored up wealth waxes old and valueless” and where legal and illegal thieves break through and steal. Think it over.</span></p>
