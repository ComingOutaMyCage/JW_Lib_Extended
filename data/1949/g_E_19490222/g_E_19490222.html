Side roo&lt;* invaded the field of fairy teles. Evon modern clergymen were caught wresting Scripture to fit the theory, though In thereby peeking to appear progressive they only backslid farther Into the bog of -pagan antiquity. That article'* title eummed up the Irresistible conclusion: &quot;Evolutionists Are Old Fogies.&quot; flow this present■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>the</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;proofs&quot; of evolution on the scales that balanced minds may see how llttlp they weigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">L</span><span class="font11">IKE an onrushing tidal wave the pseudo-science of evolution fountains from the pens and lips of modern educators and floods from the high schools and colleges to overflow the entire globe. It threatens to drown weak Christian faith and wash it from the minds of many. But studious Christians whose faith is firmly anchored in the lasting wisdom of God’s Word will not be like the unstable waves of the sea that are driven and tossed and slapped about by windy blasts. Moreover, if the thinking Christian weighs the “scientific proofs” for the theory any waves of doubt to which it once gave rise will beat against his faith in vain. The considered verdict on evolution will echo the one pronounced to Babylon’s wicked king Belshazzar: “Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.” The evolution deluge is a flash flood that will pass with these “last days”. At a distance its tidal wave appears powerful, but when confronted head on it is found to be light foam and wind-blown spray, void of weighty waters of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">First, let it be stated that an attack on evolution is not an attack on mature science. Evolution is not scientifically supported by fact. It is an unproved theory based upon hypothesis, a speculative philosophy. Evolutionists like to assume it proved, that it is no longer open to debate, and that only those who cannot think will attack it. They meet opposers with a smearing campaign of name-calling. The fact is that many scientists do not believe it, and many more that do will admit it is far from proved. Rather than return smear for unfounded smear, let us honestly weigh the “proofs” the evolutionists offer. The heaviest they have are comparative anatomy, blood tests, embryology, vestigial organs, geology, supposed new species artificially induced, and anthro</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">pology.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Appearances Can Be Deceiving</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By comparing the skeletons, muscles and nerves of different species of living creatures the evolutionist notes a similarity of structure. He finds a similarity of design .underlying vast numbers of diverse creatures, and from this circum-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">stance argues that all evolved from a common ancestor millions of years ago. But by the time' he traces all life back to this common ancestor he has forgotten his comparative-anatomy argument, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">for </span><span class="font11">he does not find the skeleton, muscle and nerve counterparts in this primitive, single-celled ancestor. Nevertheless, by, an arbitrary arrangement or classification of skeletal structures the evolutionist xseeks to show a long, gradual line of ascent terminating in man. The similarity of neighbors in the line-up is undeniable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">roof and foundation, floor and ceiling, doors and windows, walls and closets and rooms; but who would be so ridiculous as to argue that this similarity proved all houses 'evolved from one original structure? All houses are designed and built by man and for a similar purpose. Might not the similarity that exists in creatures spring from a single Creator, who designed them for life </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font11"> the earth, with special adaptation to fit some for life in the air, or on the ground, or in water? Why would the Creator vary the make-up of bone and muscle and nerve in every living form, when these three substances perform similar purposes under similar conditions and are nourished by similar foods? Comparative anatomy can prove creation as easily as it could evolution.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Are You Man or Mouse?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Professor George Nuttall, of Cambridge University, developed a test for human blood that has proved valuable in criminal investigation. A liquid called an anti-human serum was made, and when mixed with human blood caused a heavy white precipitate. But this white precipitate was not formed when the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">liquid</span><span class="font11"> was </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">mixed with the blood of chickens</span><span class="font11"> or rabbits, creatures low in the scale of evolution. When it was added to the blood of creatures close to man in the evolution scale, such as monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees, a precipitate was formed. This meant similarity of blood, and to the evolutionist similarity means one evolved from the other. But here again mere similarity proves nothing. If the blood were identical even, it would hot prove man evolved from a primitive ape form; no more than the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">fact that both sewing needle and steam </span><span class="font11">shovel are made of steel proves one evolved from the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. There are other tests to show blood similarity, and the results are often embarrassing to the evolutionists. Hence we </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hear little</span><span class="font11"> of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">these results. One shows </span><span class="font11">that the-tiger and whale are close kin, and nearer to man than certain monkeys. Testing the blood for negativeness to disease germs shows apes never suffer from many exclusively human diseases, though so far as is known Malta fever affects only man and goats and the plague hits only men and rats. The specific-gravity test shows that the horse and pig are near to man, the frog and snake are nearer to man than the monkey, and mouse blood is precisely the same. If anything is more embarrassing than this tie between man and mouse, it is the results of the Nuttall test that shows chimpanzee blood is more human than human blood. It is supposedly the amount of white precipitate that indicates humanness. The test on gorillas behaves nicely, gives less precipitate than</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">in the case of huriians, but, alas, chimpanzee blood gives more white precipitate than human blood J Perhaps evolutionists should revise their theory and point to man as the missing link between gorillas and chimpanzees.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Millions of Years into a Few Months</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The more rash evolutionists claim that the embryo of a man passes through all the evolutionary stages, from single cell to man. The few months from conception to birth crowd in millions of years of living, as each birth is claimed to be a recapitulation of the entire process of evolution. This wild contention means that the embryo of man begins as a single cell, grows into a fish, passes into a reptile, thence into a mammal, thence into a primitive^ ape form, and finally ends up as a man. It was first expounded by Ernest Haeckel, who said: “The history of the foetus is a recapitulation of the race/’ Today evolutionists do not dare champion such madness, but cling to it to lesser degrees. They drop many stages, taking short cuts, and otherwise juggle the recapitulation to suit their fancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Most evolutionists today claim only three evolutionary stages are revealed: the fish stage,‘the tail stage, and the hair stage. They say that embryos of man have gill-slits at an early stage of development, reflecting fish &quot;ancestors. Actually, these so-called “gill-slits&quot; are merely folds or arches. Even in fish embryos they are not gill-slits. They develop into gills, in fish. In the human embryo they become ear cavities, lower jaxw and neck parts. It would be as reasonable to look at a roll of paper for a printing press and say, “There is a book/' But the printer might produce from it newspapers, or magazines, or pamphlets, or handbills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When a book on evolution is intended for the generat public and not informed scientists, it will sometimes venture to state that at one stage the human em-</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY 22.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7.949</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">bryo has a tail. Kellogg did this, in his book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution the Way of Man.</span><span class="font11"> He claimed that the tail was no longer than the leg, and gradually reduced till at birth it had disappeared. At this supposed “gilled&quot; and “tailed&quot; stage the embryo is the size,of a pea, when only the principal organs exist, and these only in faint beginnings. To say that the human spine is a tail extending beyond the legs is absurd, specially when it is known that the intestine ajso extends beyond the legs, along tins “tail&quot;, near the end of which “tail&quot; is the anal opening! What monkey or other animal ever had its intestines in its tail and eliminated from the tip of its tail! The adult spine has thirty-three vertebrae; sO does the human embryo, never more, and none of them gradually disappear as though shedding a “tail&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the fourth month of development extremely soft and fine hair begins to appear on the human embryo and soon covers the whole body. It is known as the lanugo or embryonal down, begins to be lost by the eighth month, is finally lost after birth, when coarser, permanent hair takes its place. But in some places, such as the face and ears, this fine hair persists throughout life. Is that fuzz comparable to the coarse matting of hair that covers apes and other animals? The evolutionists so imply. Yet when this hair covers the human embryo it is so fine that it cannot be seen with the naked eye, except on head and eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sir Arthur Keith, Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and 'former president of the Royal Anthropological Institute, said regarding embryology and evolution: “It was expected that the embryo would recapitulate the features of its ancestors from the lowest to the highest forms in the animal kingdom. Now that the appearances of the embryo at all stages are known, the general feeling is one of disappointment; the human embryo at no stage is anthropoid in its appear</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">s</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">anee,&quot; Well-known evolutionist William Bateson said to an assembly of scientists in America regarding the argument for evolution from embryology: &quot;Today we feel silence to be the safer course.<sup>5</sup>* Proverbs 17:28 states: “Even a fool is counted wise, if he keep silent—intelligent, if he close his lips, ■—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">An American Translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Vanishing Vestigial Organs</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some structures in man and other higher forms of life are believed by evolutionists to be remains of structures once required by lower, ancestral forms, but which are no longer necessary to their present possessors, Such structures or organs are called vestigial organs. In man the evolutionists used to point to some 180 such left-overs or hang-overs from evolution, but now. as knowledge has increased these vestigial organs have diminished, till today there is only a handful. Those most frequently mentioned now are the appendix, tonsils, coccyx, and the thyroid, thymus, pineal and pituitary glands. But even informed evolutionists no longer call these organs vestigial. Each has its function, and reputable doctors testify they do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">not merit </span><span class="font11">the name vestigial. The same holds true for other so-called vestigial organs, such as the small fleshy fold in the inner angle of the eye, the muscles of the outer ear, or the body hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sir Arthur Keith stated that &quot;as Paley declared a century ago, our list of ‘useless* structures decreases as our stock of knowledge increases”. The late Professor E. S. Goodrich, of Oxford University, said: “He would he a rash man indeed who would now assert that any part of the human body is useless.&quot; Because the evolutionist may not </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">know the function</span><span class="font11"> of a structure, he in his conceit takes that as evidence that it </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">has no function.</span><span class="font11"> Moreover, vestigial organs would not prove evolution. Evolutionists must prove the acquisition of new and useful organs, not the uselessness of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">organs previously existing. Still they glibly babble about vestigial organs as “proof”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For example, retreating from the field of human vestigial </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">structures,</span><span class="font11"> they </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">cite </span><span class="font11">some in animals. Two outstanding ones are the relics of rear legs in pythons and whales. In the rear part of the big serpents there are two strong spurs projecting out two or three inches and which can be moved vigorously. These are not useless structures, but assist in propelling the serpent’s bulk along the ground and also can by used to inflict severe gashes in enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the rear part of the .whale, embedded in the flesh, are certain cartilaginous bones from six to ten inches in length. They ate not connected to the spine, nor come to the skin. They are interior organs to which muscles are attached and by which the genital and other parts are supported. They are of value to the whale, and are not the relics of hind legs. How unreasonable to believe as do evolutionists, that a fish left the water to become a land animal, worked for millions of years to get legs, then tired of them, returned to the water, changed its front legs into paddles, developed tail flukes as a propeller, let its rear legs dangle uselessly, till now they are only isolated bits of useless bone embedded in flesh. That is the fish story the evolutionists tell about the whale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Record of the Rocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many evolutionists claim geology or •paleontology gives strongest “proof” of their theory. In the older layers or strata of earth they find fossils of simple life forms. Down through the millions of years, they say, new layers were deposited and life was evolving, and more fossils were being formed. In the more recent strata they find the more complicated life forms. This, they argue, proves evolution. They ignore ,many facts that refute their argument.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">In rock layers supposed to be many millions of years old there are fossils of starfish, fish, plants, etc., that are essentially the same as these forms of life today. They have not changed or evolved. The same is true of fossils of pigs, elephants, tigers, bears, apes and other more complicated forms that are supposed to be a mere ten million years old; in that long time their offspring have not changed, but are the same as those fossilized ancients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Evolutionist Thomas Huxley admitted this, saying that change in form of animal and vegetable life since its beginning till now is “wonderfully small” Professor James Park’s </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Textbook of Geology</span><span class="font11"> said that the most obvious lesson from fossil study was that “life, even in the earliest times, differed in no way from the life of today”. Also, that “the lowly types of life that appear in the oldest rocks have persisted through all geological times up to the present day”. Professor D, F. Jones, of Yale University, said: “Certain fossil insects, well preserved in amber from geological periods which are reckoned by millions of years, differ in no perceptible way from individuals of the same species today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This substantiates the Bible record of creation, that marine or water life was first created, then birds, then land animals, and finally man, and that all of these should breed true, producing “after its kind”. Of course, within the bounds of the natural specifes there can be wide variation, as exists in the cat family, dog family, or even human family. Mendel's laws of heredity show a pattern of variation, but dogs are always dogs, cats cats, men men. One cannot get cats from dogs, or apes from men, or vice versa. And if any unnatural inter-breeding of different natural species is engineered by man, the resulting offspring, if any, is sterile. It cannot bring forth “after its kind”. The wall of partition between natural species is sterility, and this forbids passage beyond the bounds of the species, though permitting variation within those limits.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Questions That Demand Answers</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nevertheless, the evolutionists contend that species have been bridged, not just once, but unnumbered thousands of times. They must make this wild assertion to maintain their theory. But why are none of these bridges preserved in fossil in the rocks! If evolution built bridges to link species, and took millions of years in each case, why are not some of the intermediate forms seen in fossils! Then there must have been millions of them, living and dying for millions of years. Did evolution burn its bridges behind it! There is not even a trace of ashes. This line of reasoning gives a foregleam that geology not only fails to prove evolution, but perhaps boomerangs against the theory. This line of logic is worth pursuing further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In our next succeeding issue we continue to weigh the evolution theory on the balances of reason. Is the evolutionist's “evidence” of changing species and how they evolve as wanting in weight as his “proof” from comparative anatomy and embryology! Is it.as purely speculative as his geological arguments! Is his claim that anthropologists have dug up the missing link to bind man to primitive ape as vulnerable as the embarrassing blood tests that put the chimpanzee above man in the evolution tree, that backfired to kick man down to the mouse level! Setting aside the evolutionists copious theorizings and speculations, his profuse assertions and assumptions, has he any proofs that light will not dispel, as increasing knowledge has made “vestigial organs” to vanish! The answers to these and other questions will force the evolution theory to declare bankruptcy. Read them iii the next issue, wherein will appear the concluding article of this series, entitled “Missing Links Still Missing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Heavyweight Dwarfs</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nearly everyone knows that hydrogen is the lightest substance, yet very few people know who is the grand champ of all heavyweights. Guessing, some might </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">say</span><span class="font8"> lead; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">others</span><span class="font8"> uranium; or others might give the champ’s belt to un-tarnishing gold. Platinum and iridium, however, are both heavier than gold, and osmium tops them all as the heaviest known form of matter on earth. Osmium weighs 1,404.6 pounds per cubic foot, to compare with lead at 708 pounds, water at 62.4 pounds, and liquid hydrogen at 4,4 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">*8? </span><span class="font8">But when astronomers stumbled on white dwarf stars out there in the stellar vault of heaven they were utterly dismayed to find that their unit weight was many, many times that of osmium. The first of these peculiar stars, which </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font8"> says are &quot;probably the strangest, and most interesting objects in the universe”, was discovered in 1862 near Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens. For a long time little was known about these dwarfs, and up until 19,45 only 70 had been found. During the next three years 30 more were discovered. The strange thing about white dwarf stars is that they are no larger than </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font8"> earth, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">some </span><span class="font8">are as small as our moon, yet in weight they are as heavy as our sun. Such great density means that more matter or material must be packed into a much smaller space. How much more is packed in will tax </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font8"> wildest imagination beyond its limits. Take as an illustration a cubic inch of osmihm. It weighs less than a pound; 13 ounces, to be exact. Now', if it were possible to chisel a cubic inch out of a white dwarf star and place it alongside the osmium, how much do you think it would weigh? 10 pounds? 100 pounds? 1,000 pounds? Come, come, make the wildest guess you can image! 10,000 pounds? 100,000 pounds? 500,000 pounds? Maybe yes, for the lighter-weight dwarfs. But others weigh as much as 2,000,000 pounds per cubic inch! That is 1,000 tons, a weight that staggers and numbs one’s comprehension. Just think of it, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a cubic inch</span><span class="font8"> of stuff weighing as much as 50 railroad cars of coal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Impossible! you say? Well, that is what the astronomers first thought. Dr. Willem J. Luyten, the foremost authority on these stellar midgets, says their discovery &quot;caused a minor revolution in astronomical and physical think-ing”, Explaining, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font8"> says: &quot;We are here dealing with matter-imthe-raw where, under the conditions of extremely high temperatures, perhaps billions of degrees, all the atoms are ‘stripped’ of their protective covering of electrons. This makes the atom so much smaller that it becomes possible to “pack” them much closer, and from pure theory it was now possible to predict that there should exist stars in which one cubic inch might ‘weigh’ over IO,000 tons,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">V These are dwarf stars in every sense of the word. Only 1/35 the diameter of the sun, and with a volume or bulk about 1/40000 of that of the sun, one of these dwarfs has just as much matter and weight packed in it as contained in the sun. And because this tremendous amount of energy is concentrated in so small a space, these stars are very much hotter than the sun. In luminosity, however, they average only about 1/10000 of the brightness of the sun, because of the much smaller surface. One dwarf, weighing around 250 tons per cubic inch, is only 1/25000 as bright as necessary to be seen with the naked eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Any person who considers such wonders of creation as these, and fails to appreciate the infinite greatness of the almighty Jehovah God, must indeed have a midget mind with a skull as dense as a dwarf star.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27">I</span><span class="font11">S IT better for religion to govern a people jointly with a political state! Or is it better for religion to have her place outside of politics and let the government rule the people without any interference from a church? Ever since the founding of Mexico by Spain that has been an important issue in Mexico. For hundreds of years the church and state ruled hand in hand in Mexico, but finally through law the chiirch was placed in a position very inferior to the state and prohibited from taking part in politics. Since the church of Rome cannot rule in conjunction with the present political power in this nation it has attempted to put into power different political parties that would co-operate with her. But so far she has not succeeded in her plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among these parties there is one of special interest because it is attempting to establish a government according to its own ideas and is willing to use any means possible to accomplish that, ‘even if it means brother fighting against brother and the shedding of innocent blood/ According to this party the shedding of blood, innocent or not, is “merely a planting and not really a death’', because they consider those that die for the party as martyrs and use their histories as propaganda to get others to join their ranks. So far 114'have died tangling with the government forces. The party referred to is Sinarquism. It is as religious as it is political.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In order to give a brief description of this party, which operates principally in Mexico, reference will be made to the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sinarquismo,</span><span class="font11"> written by the Committee in Defense of the Revolution and</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY 22, 1943</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">published in 1944. The Revolutionaries are the ones that separated the church from the state in Mexico, and they are the political party now governing Mexico. The prologue of the book states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The “ Committee in Defense of the Revolution ... has considered since its foundation, that Sinarquism is the No. 1 danger in our country. . . . We consider it a patriotic act . . . to fight—without using violent means— this group of bad Mexicans who are taking advantage of the ignorance of the humble people to drag them into an activity which is antigovernment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During approximately the last 100 years there has been a continual fight to establish a constitution which would openly separate the church from the state. And that is what the Revolution has accomplished. A great number of Mexicans have died, a number of nations have attacked and invaded Mexico, there have been many changes of government, but finally the state was in a position superior to religion and this was far from pleasing to the religious clergy*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This separation was principally accomplished by Lazaro Cardenas, a humble and sincere person who became president in 1934. His regime merely applied to the Catholic Church a constitution which had long been in effect but had never been obeyed. Cardenas sincerely desired to help the humble class of Mexico* Shortly after coming into power he turned over to the the people, farmers, tracts of land long held by the Catholic clergy and the other wealthy people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">His plan would have worked wejl if it had not been for the opposing parties directed by the religious clergy, who at</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">all costs were attempting to disrupt the presidential arrangements because it affected their interests. A. tremendous fight took place, especially in the center of the -country, which gave birth to a number of political parties whose sole intention was to disrupt the presidents plan of helping the humble class. Naturally, all these parties were supported financially by the landholders, the wealthy, and in particular by the clergy. Every one of the parties failed after a number of/attempts to foil the presidential plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sinarquists Organized</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then the religious clergy of the Roman Catholic Church thought it wise to form a* party which, instead of depending on the wealthy and the landowners, would seek its strength from the people, the humble and illiterate farmer who has always suffered so much just attempting to live. First they formed a party called the Anti-Communist Center. They were trying to make the people think that President Cardenas was a Communist; </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font11">they failed in this because the people liked and respected the government of General Cardenas. This party was under a German, Hellmuth Oskar Sehreiter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The director of this party next thought of organizing a new party. He gathered information from people that had collaborated with Franco, from the Italian Fascist party, and with this he used his knowledge of the National Socialist party of Germany. The result was the idea of forming a militarized, hierarchical party of the great masses attracted by a program in which the people would have the first place yet always be subjected to the will of the fuehrer, of a duce, of a catidillo, of a chief. &quot;The [Sinarquists] . . conceived a type of party composed of strange elements extracted from three foreign parties and was baptized with a word which, previously, very few had heard in Mexico: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sinarqui&amp;m&quot; (Sinarqnlsmo)</span><span class="font11"> It was on</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">May &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tMt </span><span class="font11">tfie National Sinar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">quist Union was definitely founded in the city of Leon, Guanajuato, a city 100-percent fanatical and Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Through a series of talks </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">which were </span><span class="font11">compelling the humble people to take action, the movement got started, even though the people were harming themselves. And what was even worse for the people, a new factor appeared: the priest, &quot;el padrecito,” who/making use of his moral authority, was continually insisting to the people: &quot;Join up with Sinarquism, join up with Sinarquism. Sinarquism is Mexico's only salvation/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then, what is. Sinarquism really trying to attain T If the plan of its directors is considered at first sight, jhen their intentions seem good. But really, &quot;What is their program?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It would be childish to consider that the real program of the NSU [National Sinarquist Union] is that which it presents in its declarations, in the famous T6 points of Sinarquism', which are deliberately ambiguous and dema-gogical, similar to the ‘official truth* of Sin-arquiam. The NSU has its ‘r^al truth' which it attempts to conceal, but, without suspecting it, perhaps uncovers itself absolutely in stating that its final purpose is the creating of a New Social Christian </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Ovder.^Sinurquismo,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The structure of the party is similar to all of those parties of Fascist type, the supreme head of the NSU is the National director, appointed by the previous director. Nevertheless, the one that appears as the National director is merely an instrument through which works-the hidden and real power, and it is this power that changes the director, appointing the new one, when the one that has the position is not of any more use, or wheiv he is assigned to another job. All of the directors have been weak-willed youths who are easily influenced by the master directors. Having youths as directors makes the people think that the party is directed by young people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The National director receives the help of five secretaries, also appointed by the secret power of the organization* All together they constitute a national committee which directs all of the movement by means of other committees. All members of the NSU ‘receive military training, especially in rural zones* The purpose of this military instruction is shown in the September 26, 1940, issue of their newspaper, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">El Sinarquista, </span><span class="font11">which states that Sinarquism wants martyrs, because “God is asking for the blood of martyrs to save Mexico”. But the important thing about this is that the directors of the party are theologians, clergymen, Falangists and, in a number of cases, Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Purpose of Sinarquism</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. The real purpose of this organization is to co-operate with the Catholic Church to put Mexico once again in the Middle Ages through the establishment of its ‘‘New Christian Order”. The clergy’s part in this organization is clearly seen when the present government through its book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sinarquismo</span><span class="font11"> states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What they have had to use is the screen of patriotism, nationalism, and the common good, because of the mental backwardness of the masses in the center of the country which constitute their greatest reserve; and then, to avoid complications With those that might become interested in what was at the bottom of the movement, they established strict rules of discipline, obedience to the director; they considered as dogma the postulate of the NSU and the word of the directors. Methods of the Catholic Church were adapted to a political party. ... The extraordinary strength which it acquired in such a short time in the center of the country is merely the result of the clergy's participation in the organization through its priests that, from the pulpit and the confessional, would urge and use pressure on the laboring people and the Catholics to join the ranks of Sinarquism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thus continued the campaign of the party until it had nearly a million members, the great majority being women and men of the. laboring class. Their bloody fights and triumphs were bragged about in their newspaper, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">El Sinar-quista,</span><span class="font11"> of November 4, 1943, and they also stated more of their present plans':</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We want them to amend article 130 of the Constitution [which prohibits the church from being united to the state]. We want the Catholic Church to have not only a decent position in Mexico, like she has in any civilized country, but </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">also a .privileged position^ </span><span class="font11">which she should have by right because of being the builder of our nation. In Mexico, contrary to our previous actions as a nation, the Catholic Church has been persecuted and forced to abide within the limits of its temples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Eleven years have passed since Sinarquism was founded in Mexico. It claims at present to have half a million men in its ranks. It has left a bloody and fanatical trail behind it. Its latest leaflet,distributed November, 1948,says: “The National Sinarquist Union has, as its final purpose, the establishing in Mexico a social order, according to our own peculiar characteristics, based on the social Christian doctrine.” Their call is no longer to the illiterate laboring class but to the educated professional class of people to &quot;be the pillars of the new Mexico”. Continues their publication: &quot;The National Sinarquist Union has entered into its second period, undoubtedly the most important one: that of carrying out its program. We are very close to victory. In a short time the people will have fulfilled their mission.” ••</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">. Truly the history of Sinarquism shows that it is the public $nemy Number 1 in Mexico and it is a sure thing that the Sinarquistie movement will not rest nor give up its fight to establish a Romanish church-state government But in order to see whether or not the Roman Catholic Church will regain the dictatorial position she has held in Mexico for 400 years, it will be necessary to keep an eye on her new Mexican “sword of the church”, Sinarquism.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> correspondent in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Chinese Puzzle</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are some odd facts about the Chinese situation. Contrary to what &quot;&nbsp;you might gather from the newspapers, the Communists who are threatening China are not Russians, They are Chinese. While these Chinese get their ideas from Moscow, they get their support from the Chinese countryside. They have had very little from Russia. Russia was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">first great power io help Chiang Kui-shek in his war with Japan. While we were sending the Japs scrap iron and oil, Russia was sending Chiang planes and guns. Between 1937 and 1939, Russia sent more than a quarter of a billion dollars in aid to Chiang—five times what we sent. But here is the strange part: During the entife course of the war, from 1937 to 1945, the Russians refused to send the Chinese Communist army as much as a plane, or a tank of gasoline. All of Russia’s help </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> China, as well as all of America’s help, was cleared through Chiang Kai-shek, the deadly enemy of the Communists. As late as 1946, when General Marshall returned from his mission to China, he said he.knew of no evidence whatsoever that the Chinese Communists were receiving supplies from Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt; In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font8"> greatest aerial troop movement in history, American planes moved 80,000 of Chiang’s best troops to cities the Communists were ready to take over. Our navy shipped additional armies from Canton to North China. American Marines moved to North China to guard the railroads from which. Chiang’s troops launched their successful drives into Communist-held territory. We supplied the troops, furnished the equipment and advised on over all strategy. But, alas, the Chinese Communists have recaptured much of the territory we gave to Chiang, and now threaten to sweep all China. Some of Chiang’s best Am eric an-trained troops have deserted and gone over to the Communists Great quantities of American supplies have fallen into their hands. What is wrong<sup>1</sup>? The United States is trying to stop a revolt that is Jong overdue.

<p><span class="font8">f The 200-inch giant </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">eye atop</span><span class="font8"> Mount Palomar has thus far presented problems instead of valuable photographs. The most serious trouble is a bulge along the outer edge of the massive mirror. It is 20 million tbs of an inch too high, an error seemingly slight, hut until it is removed the distant nebulae will keep their privacy, Another ailment of the telescope is that the edges of the mirror respond to temperature changes more quicklv than the center, and this uneven expansion with temperature change throws the delicately calculated curvature of the mirror awry. So the mirror will have to undergo some weight-reducing treatment to lose its bulge, and small fans and insulating aluminum foil around the edges will care for the temperature problem. The scientists hope that by fall at the latest the giant mirror will be relaying to them some of heaven’s secrets.</span></p>

When the doctor arrived at the party and sipped a small glass of beer his face got red, his heart pounded, his breath choked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Alcohol in any form revolted him. It looked like the pill for alcoholics. Other medicines for worms are sometimes fatally poisonous when mixed with alcohol. Hence, during the past two years 500 alcoholics have been treated with the drug. After only one dose of the drug 450 of them still have a loathing for alcohol. Worms and alcoholism may not be birds, but it seems both may be killed with one stone—tetraethyl-thiuram di sulfide?</span></p>

<p><span class="font27">I</span><span class="font11">N THE fall of 1946 a pair of vultures circled over a spot of Southern California’s Mojave desert, and looked with interest at a scene on a black ribbon of highway below. It was different from this highway's usual attraction of dead mice, prairie dogs, or skunks. Two of the fast-moving craft that so often added flashes of color to the dark road and pale desert lay crumpled and still a few feet apart The buzzards’ interest, of course,'centered upon the inert bodies scattered on both sides of the road, disgorged by the colliding monsters upon the sparse wasteland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On a cruel bed of cholla lay two women's bodies, dusty, unprotesting the sand and thorns. Thrust through one bloody stocking was a jagged protrusion of bone. On the other side of the highway a man, with his head in the dirt, appeared almost as if he had been arrested in the act of eating the dust on which he lay. Two children moaned on the uptilted seat of one of the wrecks. At the wheel of the other was a figure in a pose so grotesquely broken as to manifestly proclaim sudden death. Twisted metal, scattered glass, and the splotches of gore added the customary trimmings to another auto massacre scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How could this accident have happened on a highway without curve, without defect, without visual obstruction! Both cars were obviously recent models. The famous desert clarity added to the afternoon's ease of car operation. Nevertheless <sub>(</sub> the characteristic debris and casualties of the head-on collision littered this blameless strip of pike. Cars are now collecting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Let us leave the increasing knot of people, which, among its customarily large number of morbid gapers, fortunately included two humanitarians who rendered first aid and eventually procured an ambulance. Observers later stated that the buzzards, which had been joined by several companions, circled with evident anticipation until the last mangled body had been removed. Tn all, the doctor’s report of this real accident listed six casualties: one man dead, one man and two women all suffering from multiple fractures and lacerations, one child with broken nose, one with fractured pelvis. Investigation of the cause now takes us back seventy iniles west of the point of the crash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The scene of inquiry is taken up here because it is the closest point to the accident that any of the victims of the eastbound car can remember. (The dead driver of the west-bound car cannot testify, and his companion, with whom he had worked, cannot remember anything on the day of the wreck at all.) Two sisters occupy the front seat of this car, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font11">about one hour and a half from its unsuspected doom. Both are competent drivers; one has asked the driver to let her relieve her if she gets tired. Their speed is about 55 m.p,h. Their children, a boy and a girl, chat gaily about the fish they each expect to catch in Wyoming, w*here they are going. Their next memory is of awaking in great pain among the sand dunes and cacti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is, of course, impossible to state exactly what happened. The front wheels were so badly demolished that any possible evidence of steering defect was obliterated* But most of the insurance examiners, as well as the sheriff’s office, doubted if there had been any such defect* After talking with the single man survivor, the experts pieced it together somewhat like this: The deceased driver had been traveling day and night from the vicinity of Chicago, eager and overanxious to meet his sweetheart in Los Angeles. Worn from travel, sleep dragging at his eyelids, the normal brain warnings of highway hazards became dulled, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">finally narcotized</span><span class="font11"> by fatigue* The fact that his head tended to droop, his hands on the wheel loosen, had worried him a little the day before as he nearly hit a blue Cadillac. Probably on this fatal day also his head had begun to wobble, his sagging body and loosened grip dragging the steering wheel erratically, causing a zigzag course on the highway-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then a blurring shape was coming at him, fast* Trying to straighten his body with his left hand, his car was turned directly into the path of the approaching shape. His speed is unknown, but assuming that it was no greater than the 55 m.p.h. speed limit (although it probably exceeded that), the two vehicles were thrown together at the combined speed of 110 m.p.h. The distance between them was diminishing at the approximate rate of 160 feet per second* Unsuspicious of any such erratic move, the other driver, who had seen the car some distance ahead, may have turned her head for a fatal .second, enough for the three hundred feet separating them to shrink to about a hundred forty feet, leaving only a fraction of a second for a warning message to the brain, a decision on whether to brake or veer into the sand, to communicate this decision to hands and feet, to manipulate the necessary response from the car, to avert crash. Many before these have found that the powerful killer of modern times can outspeed brain, eyes and hands, to deliver lightning deathblows. Mind cannot always control the hundred-horse-</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Seven Major American</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Wars</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The above is not the only fatal type of auto accident, by any means. On the other hand, it is not as unusual as some may suppose. The deadly head-on collision accounts for about 25 percent of all “open country’ fatal accidents. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">{The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font11"> “Automobile Accidents”) This same authority adds that 85 percent of all casualty accidents happen on clear or cloudy days, leaving snow, fog, rain, mist, dust or smoke to account for only 15 percent; that “approximately 80 percent of aft injury accidents occur on straight, level, dry roads having either a concrete or asphalt surface, and that no road defects were reported in over 90 percent of the accidents” ; that new cars having no mechanical defects are the chief offenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Probably the most shocking is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">charge of the New York Times editorial </span><span class="font11">of February 11, 1947: “Our nation has engaged in seven major wars since 1776. They covered a period of eighteen years. Compare the death toll of those eighteen years of war with the toll in automobile accidents in the eighteen prewar years ending in 1941: Eighteen years of war —520,000 killed or died of wounds; eighteen years of peace—550,000 killed in auto accidents?' An article in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Past</span><span class="font11"> lists 720,000 dead, and 25,000,000 injured, since 1923. During World War II alone, traffic accidents exceeded battle casualties three times. For 1948, approximately 32,000 deaths! Killed in 1947, 32,500. The unenviable distinction of being peak year goes to 194-1, with 39,969. On the average, every ten minutes 2 people are killed and 200 injured by this modern invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two-fifths to one-half of all persons killed by motor vehicle accidents are pedestrians. One out of four of the twelve to fourteen thousand pedestrians killed had been drinking. A corollary to the axiom “If you drink, don't drive” might be “Nor walk on the roads or highways”, especially at night, as three out of four accidents from drinking happen after dark. Accidents (1946), including fires, catastrophes, public and private losses, cost the United States $6,400,000,000. Motor vehicle accidents accounted for more than a third of this, or $2,200,000,000.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Causes</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Carelessness and drinking on the part of pedestrians, plus speeding bn the part of the vehicle drivers, are among the more important contributing factors. But no single speed limit can be defined as safe. Speeding, therefore, can be defined only as “driving too fast for the condition of the road and traffic” Since about 9 percent of all drivers in fatal accidents and 25 percent of all pedestrian fatalities had been drinking, the use of alcohol is a serious factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By far the largest number of authorities agree that poor or careless driving coupled with speeding presents the greatest hazard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The other flailing charges may largely be divided into five classes: (1) criticism of the vehicle, its design, excessive power, age, and general repair; (2) criticism of the roads;, (3) criticism or blame of the weather; (4) criticism of enforcement methods, especially failure to maintain proper vehicle inspection, enactment of compulsory driver insurance (many states already have this) and insistence upon re-examination of licensed drivers in order to detect disabilities, and to sift out “constant violators” and “accident repeaters”; and (5) criticism of insufficient driving educational facilities, schools and elsewhere “even for those who walk”. Wild suggestions were made for “auto clinics’* for the &quot;repeaters”. Charges also were made against “women drivers” but were not substantiated by the facts. “Public apathy” also was scored in the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One writer summed up these needs under the headings, enforcement, education, engineering, eligibility. If another opinion will not bore the reader, it is that often it is not the cars, the weather, the laws or lack of them, the education, nor even the material or construction of the roads that are chiefly at fault. It is the material under the driver's hat, the quality or tone of the gray matter in his skull. He may be possessor of the Nazi spirit of contempt for the lives and property of others. He may conceitedly assume that use of a car is his exclusive privilege; or else he is oblivious to the potential danger of this armored projectile. He is the man who shoots over his partner's head in the hunt, throws down his lighted cigarette or match in the dry forest, and plunges his way through crowded streets. He, not the automobile, is the killer. Strange that men of this age do not generally realise that courteous and careful maneuvering of their automobile is far more worthy and appreciated than tipping their hat on the street or giving another a seat.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Some Safety Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When you drive you should not rely in any way upon the ability or consideration of the other driver. He may be competent, safe and considerate, or he may be egotistical, life-imperiling and drunk. Remember that for absolutely safe driving you cannot work on any other hypothesis than that the other driver is a potential menace. It is often possible, however, if you are following a car, which should never be closer than safe stopping distances, to learn something of the driver's characteristics. If he is erratic or weaving he may be drunk. If he wildly passes another car without proper clearance ahead before another car approaches, he may be considered either in a frantic hurry or possibly a selfish chance-taker. Steady, reserved driving is equally easy to observe. Bus operators are forbidden to converse with passengers; “pleasure car” drivers should avoid absorbing tete-a-tete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Drive ’courteously, considering the rights and safety of others. Pedestrians generally have the right of way by law. Give them wide clearance in passing, avoiding “close shaves” accompanied by startling horn-blasting. As an emergency warning it should be used. It should also be blown at blind curves and corners, and coming up over hill crests on narrow roads. The horn should also be used to warn approaching cars when they encroach upon the left side of the highway. Too often driving becomes a subconscious, reflex action. If attention is diverted, the oncoming car packs nothing less than potential mayhem and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you have approached a town at considerable speed, slow down immediately, more than necessary, even, to get the proper speed perspective. If you have been traveling 55 miles per hour or more, then thirty seems very slow; but it may be double the speed that is safe, in a town. Safe stopping distances naturally depend on speed, since, it has been observed, cars travel in feet per second approximately one and a half times their miles-per-hour speed. Accordingly the National Safety Council has established the'following table: 20 m.p.h., 30 feet; 40 m.p.h., SO to 100 feet; 60 m.p.h., 270 to 300. Remember that the striking power of the car is nine times as great at 60 m.p.h. as at 20. One writer remarks that striking another car or a solid surface at 60 is like going over Niagara Fails in a barrel full of spikes! It is like falling off a ten-story building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Constantly maintain the widest and most expansive view of the road ahead through a clean windshield, the road behind through an accurately set rear-view mirror. Then be sure that you signal for all turns and stopping. It is more’</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">im</span><span class="font11">portant to avoid a wreck than to prove the other party’s fault for the accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The proper way to take a curve is first to slow down on approach, then as you have turned your wheels, power the car firmly. The mechanical construction of the differential causes the outside wheel to move faster than the inside, and thus the motor power, expressed in the wheels, facilitates the turn. Never look at the headlights of an approaching car, but look to the side of the road in order to avoid their blinding effect. A courteous and effective way to invite him to dim his lights is to dim yours as far ahead as possible? School yourself to drive close to the right side of the road, so that it becomes a fixed habit. When descending steep hills, shift to low gear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are two special hazards of winter that are worth mentioning: skidding hnd reduced visibility. The use of a defroster and antiskid chains is an absolute must on icy toads. Unless you have chains on the car it will take you three to eleven times as far to stop on snow or ice as on ordinary pavement.* When roads are slippery, allow three to six car lengths for every ten miles per hour you are traveling. On slippery pavements always apply your brakes lightly, with a pumping action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This does not by any means relate all the driving problems, but it should bring lo mind that when we start a car forward we enter the danger zone. A Christian especially should allow as great a margin of safety both for himself and for others as reasonable progress to his destination will permit. In this fearful and frantic world it often requires much restraint to maintain moderate speed and cautious conduct. But it is necessary, for Jehovah does not protect His people from all the consequences of carelessness, but warns them to be alert, circumspect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ If they fail, Death may grab the wheel. And he needs it only for a split second.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27">W</span><span class="font11">HILE the woman of the Western world is grudgingly giving in to the fashion of long skirts and worrying what will happen to those short skirts hanging in the closet, and while the fashion experts are once again saying we have done it again, the ladies of far-away India are smiling as they wrap around them the ever-graceful sari. The sari has been the joy of the women of India for 2,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Who would not joy in a, dress that needs no cutting, sewing or shaping; no tucks, darts or padding; no pins, hooks or zippers. All you need is five to eight yards of cloth. But first you put on your </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">choli;</span><span class="font11"> that is the close-fitting blouse or bodice which leaves your midriff bare. You step into your </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">chappies;</span><span class="font11"> these are sandals; they may be of various styles, but usually with a strap between your large toe and the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then over a long underskirt that fits very snugly around the waist you wear your sari. Hold the end of your sari in front of you, then tuck into the waist of your underskirt, turn around, pulling your sari snugly around you bringing it to the front again, and tuck in. Now you make six or eight folds to form pleats: These you also tuck in at front, leaving approximately two yards. Take the balance of material in left hand and pass it around again bringing it to the front. Draw this up across</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490222_files/g_E_19490222-6.png" alt="" style="width:280pt;height:378pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">the front of the body and then throw it over your left shoulder. This leaves nearly a yard hanging down the back, which is used frequently to cover the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So there you are fit for any part of the day's activity. The sari is worn by women of every social class in India, though there are variations in the final touches of how it is worn. Some wear it thrown over the left shoulder, and in some districts it is worn over the right shoulder. If you were a Parsi lady, after pleating you would take it under your left arm, over your right shoulder, tucking one corner into the waist, the remainder falling in graceful folds in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The dress of the middle-class lady of the Maratha countries U done a little differently. Here the orthodox method is to pass it round the waist so as to divide it into two unequal parts. The longer part falls as a skirt and the end is drawn between the legs and tucked behind the waist; the shorter part is passed across the upper part of the body and thrown over the shoulders. When worn nicely, the lower portion has the appearance of breeches falling in graceful folds. The sari worn this way can be very attractive if one can afford to buy an extra-long length of cloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But this is the style worn by the lower class who cannot afford much, and hence much of their body is exposed and so far from being attractive it hardly more than covers where it touches* Among the poorer classes, particularly the beggars, they do not wear a choli but use the top part of the sari to cover them in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The sari is loved by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font11"> women of India for many reasons, and perhaps that is why it has remained the style for so long. The piece of sari worn across the front and up over the shoulder makes a convenient covering for the Indian mother to feed her baby. It is very common to see among the poorer classes mamma sitting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font11"> the sidewalk with her legs crossed providing a cradle and the weetike underneath his mother’s sari having lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And want to know a secret! The girls like the sari because it is not too revealing and does not give away their secrets and so without girdles and padding or the leg-adorning sheer stockings one and all look graceful in a sari. So whether you are the tall, slim girl who gives it a stately appearance or the short plump girl you too will look sweet in a sari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many Hindu ladies on principle wear cotton, often white; it is usually a fine voile, and this gives an air of cleanness and freshness. The Parsi ladies always wear silk saris with a border. Though all saris have some form of border, the Parsi ladies are famous for their outstandingly lovely borders. They are often finely embroidered with flowers, but another border that is popular is made up of little individual felt flowers each individually tacked on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The modern Hindu lady and also the Indian Christians usually wear a silk sari. Many delightful combinations of choli and sari are found, lace and georgette, velvet and taffeta or embroidered organdy with plain organdy. But perhaps the most delicate is the san of georgette usually in a plain color, also very attractive in shaded colors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But whether of the Occident or of the Orient, let Us not concern ourselves too deeply with this adorning, but follow the advice of the Bible. “Yours ought not to be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font11"> outward </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">adornment</span><span class="font11"> of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">plaiting</span><span class="font11"> of hair, putting on jewels of gold, or wearing various dresses, but an inward beauty of nature, the imperishable ornament of a gentle and peaceful spirit, which is indeed precious in the sight of God?

<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Rome Conquers E* Boyd Barrett</span></h5>
<p><span class="font27">Y</span><span class="font11">ES, E. Boyd Barrett, author of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Rome</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Stoops to Conquer</span><span class="font11">, and several other striking books, has returned to the Roman Catholic Church. That means the repudiation by him of the words and work of a good twenty years, years during which he produced some quite candid and informative books. In these books Barrett revealed some of the inner workings of the great earthly organization that claims to dominate earth, heaven and hell. Barrett told the truth as he saw it, and wrote with considerable force and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Barrett's retraction, or the public statement of it, appeared in the Jesuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">magazine </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">America.</span><span class="font11"> He says it was his own brother’s prayers that brought about the reconciliation, a simple brother who prayed, or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">said prayers, for </span><span class="font11">twenty years at Dublin, until the day of his death. Anticipating his canonization, Barrett says that after death his brother “face to face with God” won the battle of prayer. The ex-priest was reconciled to Rome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The article in Jmencuis called “touching”. in a brief introduction. It </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font11"> pathetic. Barrett pleads for sympathy for “stray priests”, whom he classes with himself, though their motives for quitting the Roman Catholic church are often quite different from Barrett’s own. But, quoting him, in regard to the leaving of one or another of such &quot;stray priests”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Maybe he was goaded to it. The injustice he suffered was too great to be put up with. His superior, his bishop, his pastor, was against him. His nerves were taut. He was overwrought. It was a veritable shell shock. His judgment failed him utterly. God seemed far away^and it was then that the cunning whisper of the Evil One filled his ears till he could hear nothing, else I &quot;You will go mad unless you make the break—now!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thus Barrett pictures the priest who breaks with Rome. He intimates they are unbalanced, and that the treatment they got from their superior in the church drove them to it. Barrett admits, &quot;To attempt to conceal the fact that there are many stray shepherds [of Rome] living in our big cities is unwise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But what was it that brought Barrett back to the Roman obedience at last! Was it the dread of eternal torture in never-ending hell, his sure destination according to the church! Was it the appalling thought of hundreds, or even thousands of years in the excruciating flames of. a purgatory in which he now professes to believe! No, he does not mention those compelling considerations. Barrett had in the past referred to these and other doctrines of Rome as &quot;glorious” and &quot;incredible”. But the great dread that brought him back, says he, was &quot;the thought of the bleak misery of being buried in unhallowed ground—of being buried in a lonely grave that had no blessing on it, nor the shadow of the Cross over it—that shocked me into a realization of where I stood. . . . How could I lie in peace . . . without being prayed for?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Barrett now, cautiously, refers to his former books as “foolish, sarcastic books</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">about the church’s policies and practices”. But since he had made many statements that are confirmed strongly by circumstances and events, a pathetic retraction, a reluctant recantation, will hardly break down what he wrote in a more confident frame of mind. And, such being the ease, this brief article may well conclude with the conclusion from Barrett’s book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer, </span><span class="font11">a truth confirmed now in his own experience, for Rome has conquered Barrett:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Who can place a limit to* the Catholic objective in this country [United States of America]! Re-open -diplomatic relations with Rome! Though gratified by such a concession, why should Catholics be content with that! Accord to them the right of exclusive censorship over books, plays, amusements and the Press. The Church would accept such office without giving thanks for it, for she would regard it as her exclusive right to enjoy it Amend the Constitution so as to allow State Legislatures to apportion public moneys to the support of Catholic schools and institutions. The Church would grudgingly admit that a long-delayed obligation was being met by the country. Go further, and amend the Constitution so as to recognize the jurisdiction of her Ecclesiastical Courts and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">establish</span><span class="font11"> the Catholic Church as the official Church of America. At this point the Church would begin to relax and smile with content. But still she would demand more and more of us. She would have charge of the departments of philosophy and history in all our universities; she would have large sections of her Canon Law incorporated into the State Laws; she would insist on being empowered to exercise certain essential inquisitorial rights—not, of course, Torquemada stuff—but a modernized and civilized Holy O.G.P.U. Never was the Catholic Church in any country in the world since Christendom began so rich, so highly organized, so influential, so loyally soldiered by her subjects as she is today in the United States. Never was she tempted to make a supreme effort by stakes more large and glorious than those at issue here and now. [Pp. 265, 266]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rome will stoop to conquer. And now E. Boyd Barrett will stoop with her, all to the empty end that; his bones may lie in &quot;hallowed ground”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A few months </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ago</span><span class="font11"> the name of Nicaragua’s capital, Managua, was tunefully brought to international attention. This Latin-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could hardly have</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">vertisement had it suddenly been blown to bits by the vol-eanic disturbances which rumble under it. No international news event occurred there to bring it into the public eye, but yet hundreds of thousands of the English-Spanish-speaking nations were repeating its name daily, and radio waves carried its praises to the ends of the earth. Singers, juke boxes and phonographs blared forth their contribution to the musical announcement that there existed a “wonderful place<sup>7</sup>', a “city of amor between the Caribbean and the Pacific shore&quot;. The song skyrocketed to popularity, enchantingly telling of Managua's </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;haciendas</span><span class="font11"> for a few pesos down&quot;, its </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">senoritas,</span><span class="font11"> coffee, bananas, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">sombreros,</span><span class="font11"> tarantulas, temperature, and the ever-present </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">frijol.es.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whether or not it was a carefully planned campaign to “sell&quot; Managua ro the world, today wherever its name is mentioned immediately it is recognized, located and associated with blue lakes, moonlight and gaiety. For those who have found delight iu its sung praises, a little of the city’s history and factual existence wall be enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Comparing Managua with other Latin-American capitals it is very hew, not becoming the capital of'Nicaragua until February 9, 1852, and all of its present buildings date from a disaster in 1931, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">However, its surroundings were well </span><span class="font11">known to the Spaniards by the midsixteenth century, and long before that a Managua Indian village occupied the present site. The setting of Managua, on the beautiful lake shore, in the midst of wooded hills and striking mountain peaks, is the most pleasant and delightful one any could wish to see.' The extremely warm climate of the region has been attributed to vapors rising front Momotombo, a volcano across the'lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the song writer had visited the capital in its early days no doubt he would have been inspired to write an entirely different song. Its primitiveness was aptly described by a British captain who visited Managua in 1869 and wrote down instructive information for future travelers of his dav. He narrated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is absolutely nothing to associate with the capital of a country — no public libraries, museums, theatres, places of amusement, etc. At eight o’clock at night all is quiet as a city of the dead. Perhaps here and there a gambling party may prolong its unholy occupation, but the generality of the inhabitants have gone to sleep—I was almost going to say bed; but that would be a misstatement, as there is no such thing as a bed in the whole country. You may see roughly made wooden bedsteads, over which cowhides are stretched, but there is no bedding. Even the best families use </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font11"> linen sheets, . , .All classes arc dreadfully afraid of water; and whenever they sec a European washing himself, especially early in the morning, they never fail to tell him of the danger he is running. With a few exeeptions, the houses are very filthy and full of vermin. I strongly advise future travelers to provide themselves with a tent and thus escape the necessity of seeking any other shelter but their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On his next trip through Managua the captain failed to follow his own advice and sought shelter at a. local </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">pension. </span><span class="font11">The experience caused him to write words of warning anew to other travelers; seeking luxuries in Managua. He writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The inn was a fair specimen of those institutions throughout the country kept by natives, and is known by the nickname of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Hotel de Hambre&quot;</span><span class="font11"> (Hotel of Hunger), from travelers having the privilege of paying pretty highly for being kept just above the starvation point on sun-dried beef, brown beans, a few eggs and some maize cakes. In conjuring up such an inn, dismiss from your mind all notion of comfort or coziness. If taken in, which in one sense one always is, you may have to share your room with half a dozen fellows. There may be perhaps a few empty bedsteads, but unless you bring your own bedding or hammock, you have a most miserable time of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From its birth Managua has seen more than twenty presidents come and go, and has been the center of political upheaval for nearly a hundred years. It withstood civil war in the 1850’s, which has raged time and again since then. It witnessed the arrival of the filibustered William Walker, an American adventurer from Tennessee, who inarched in with 58 men and had himself declared president. It saw American soldiers in its streets from 1913 to 1933 during the intervention of the United States in Nicaraguan affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At 10: 23 on the mo ruing of Mar. 31, 1931, Managua, now with much of its business section under pavement and moving ahead</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">with the construction of new public buildings, felt a slight earth tremor, which commenced slowly, then gradually grew in magnitude until it had shaken practically everything to the ground. Inflammable materials caught fire immediately, and unchecked by the next day twenty entire blocks were black smoking ruins. More than a thousand citizens lost their lives and another thousand were wounded, Thousands more were stripped of everything they possessed, including family and loved ones. This disaster warned future constructors, and today visitors see few buildings over two stories high, and the majority of large buildings built around steel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">But it should not be construed that all in Managua is without beauty or worth, A closer look at the modern Managua will tell us something of the virtues she strives so hard to emphasize and of her more unsightly aspects, which Casual visitors fail to notice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">One can appreciate their love of their homeland when looking down at the scene from the distant mountains to the south, where their eyes drink in the broad blue lake covering 650 square miles stretching away to blend with the darker blue of the mountains outlined to the north, the majestic volcanic Momo-tombo, with its wisp of smoke curling around its apex off to the west, while the broad, rich flatland to the east makes a green mat of thick vegetation as far</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">In general the house surfaces are graceful and simple, without superfluous ornaments or’ incrustations. One sees deeply indented windows, very few of which have glass, being covered by heavy wooden doors at night. No second-story house is complete without its overhanging balcony. Plate glass show windows are vulnerable to thieves, so many shops have wide doorways leading directly to inside displays. These equipped with sliding metal shutters are sealed at night against unwanted guests, with which the city abounds. At night Mana-guans may be seen lounging in their hammocks </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">in the</span><span class="font11"> open doorways, or sitting in groups in their rocking chairs out on the sidewalk chatting and listening to their neighbor's radio, which is usually loud enough for the entire neighborhood to hear comfortably or uncomfortably<sub>f</sub></span></p>

Their familiar bell clang could be heard at every corner along with the din of many ailto and bus horns, until a recent law prohibited the use of any horn or bell, much to the nerve-soothing pleasure of the city dwellers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A visit to the Loma, or the hill overlooking the city, brings into view the Moorish-style palace of the president, built in 1929. Back of this the ground drops steeply to Tiscapa, one of the green, volcanic lagoons, curiously enough staying at the same level as Lake Managua a mile and a half away. It is a common saying that the man or men that hold this hill rule Nicaragua.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">C In a 160-square-niile area in Ohio the army and weather men teamed up to put scientific rainmaking to the test. The area was dotted with observation . posts, Radar sets kept watch on the air above. When clouds appeared a Flying Fortress dashed upward to shower them with dry-ice pellets while another plane photographed the “Operation Rain”. But the clouds would not be wrung dry like a shirt on washday. Practically nothing happened when winter clouds were sprinkled with dry-ice or water droplets or chemicals such as silver iodide. The towering cumulus clouds of summer were almost </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">as</span><span class="font8"> miserly. Eighteen out of 79 shook out a few raindrops, but in these cases natural rain was already falling not many miles distant. The air force and weather bureau said: “The responsible scientists of the project interpret the long aeries of experiments to mean that recently proposed artificial weather modification processes are of relatively little economic importance.” In simple words, when the clouds gave up no rain the rainmakers gave up.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Human Genealogy of the King</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">T</span><span class="font11">HE King was long ago foretold by Jehovah's prophet with these words: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.” ((Isaiah 9:6,7) This prophecy is a logical sequence to a previous one, namely: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and. shall call his name Immanuel.”—Isaiah 7:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The latter prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus born at Bethlehem-judah, as distinctly stated seven centuries later at Matthew 1: 20-25. For this reason a virgin directly descended from David, former king of Jerusalem, was chosen to be His mother, and to her the angel of Jehovah said at the child's conception: “Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall Ite called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. . . . The holy [spirit] shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall he called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:31-35) Later, a disciple of this Son of God said under inspiration: “The patriarch David, . . . knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.&quot; —Acts 2: 29,30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But where ddes Joseph, Mary’s husband, come in on this question of determining Jesus' right to the throne of David? If Christ or Messiah was to be of the fruit of David’s loins, hence of the seed of David, and so heir of David’s throne, was it not needful for Him to have a human father of the Davidic line? No! Today, as always, inheritance and royalty is at times reckoned through a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">mother</span><span class="font11"> as well as through a father, as in the case of ,the son born last November to Princess Elizabeth of England. Thus it was with Jesus: His mother was a daughter of David, of the seed and loins of David. Hence her offspring, especially her firstborn, was not only her own son but, through her, the Son of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Jewish genealogies it was customary to reckon lineage through either father or mother. In the case of tracing the genealogy through the mother the custom was to reckon the genealogy through the mother’s ancestry but to treat her husband as being, instead of her, the son of her father. Today we would call such a person the son-in-law. In the King’s genealogy as given by the gospel writer Luke, the seed of King David and of the patriarch Abraham is thus traced through Mary’s ancestry, and accordingly Luke 3:23 speaks of her husband as being “the son of Heli”, Heli being Mary’s father and Joseph’s father-in-law.—Read Luke 3: 23-38*</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now God’s law stated: “If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter?* This law was based on the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, (Numbers 26:33 and 27:1-8) In such a case, where the blood of the grandfather passed to a child, a grandson, through a daughter, the Jews rejected the name of this daughter from the genealogical table and listed instead the name of that daughter’s husband and counted him as the son of her father. On this principle Joseph, himself a descendant of King David, married Mary, the daughter of Heli, and in the genealogical register of Mary’s family Joseph is counted for Heli’s son. Likewise Salathiel, mentioned by Luke, was really the son of Jechonias (Matthew 1:12); but he married the daughter of Neri, and so at Luke 3:23-38, he was entered as the “son of Neri”. Zorobabel was the son of this marriage of Salathiel and the daughter of Neri, and in this Zorobabel the lines of Solomon and of Nathan his brother unite into one, #o that Zorobabel was a descendant of David through Solomon as well as through Nathan. Now Joseph and Mary were both descendants of this Zorobabel; so they both were actually descendants of David,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, the genealogy of Joseph, at Matthew 1:13, traces his descent through Abiud, son of Zorobabel, whereas Luke 3:27 traces Mary’s descent through Rhesa, son of the same Zorobabel, Rhesa and Abiud being brothers- Thus the genealogies given by Matthew and Luke are parts of one perfect whole; each of them is necessary to the explanation of the other. By Matthew’s genealogical table we prove Mary’s descent as well as Joseph’s descent from David through Solomon ; and by Luke’s table we see the descent of Joseph as well as that of Mary from David through Nathan, Solomon’s brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But since Luke does not mention Mary’s name, how do we know that Mary was the daughter of Heli and that </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">FEBRUARY</span><span class="font11"> 1W</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Joseph was simply his son-in-law 1 Mary would have to be understood as such, because Luke reports that the angel who appeared to Mary told her God would give her miraculously conceived Son the “throne of his father David’', and so it was necessary to prove this by her genealogy, that given by Luke. Moreover, Mary is called by the Jews “Bath Heli,” that is, “the daughter of Heli/’ Early writers who professed to be Christians call her the “daughter of Joi akim and Anna”. But as the first part of his name Jo means Jehovah, who is God, the name Joiakim has at times been changed to Eliakim, because the first part of this name </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">El</span><span class="font11"> means God. (See 2 Chronicles 36:4.) Eli, or Heli, as Mary’s father is called, is just the shortening of the name Eliakim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The gospel writer Luke therefore gives the King’s genealogy through Mary the daughter of Heli. He thus critically distinguishes Jesus’ </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font11"> genealogy from His </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">legal</span><span class="font11"> genealogy by saying, parenthetically, at Luke 3:33, that, “as was supposed,” Jesus was the son of Joseph, the son of Heli, whereas Jesus was in reality the son of Mary, the daughter of Heli. So Jesus was a grandson of Heli on his mother Mary’s side. When'we compare Luke’s table with that of Matthew we find they both agree from Abraham to David; but from David to Joseph they are plainly different lines of descent, agreeing only in two persons, namely, Salathiel and Zorobabel. Matthew and Luke call Abiud and Rhesa the sons of Zorobabel, although the table in 1 Chronicles 3:19 makes no mention of them as Zorobabel’s sons. This should not worry us, for it was a custom of the Jews to call the same person by different names, and this custom was peculiarly prevalent about the time of Zorobabel. (See Daniel 1:6, 7; 2 Samuel 3:3 &gt;and 1 Chronicles 3:1.) This was doubtless the case with the sons of ZorobabeL'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thus the unbroken descent of Jesus from David is Seripturally certified.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font11">tion of that city in the centre of Europe in the vicinity of the crossroads between France, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Germany and Italy, an outpost</span><span class="font11"> of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the gospel </span><span class="font11">toward the South, and his intention was to make it a Bulwark of the Reformation, from whence a splendid radiation of Christian truth would be made possible. A Christian government was to be established there, an example of faith </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">and morals to</span><span class="font11"> other peoples, a Theocracy, that means a nation with no other head but God and no other laws but those to be found in the Bible, interpreted by its ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Calvin proposed to remodel Geneva . into a city of God, a holy city. That was bound to become a failure. Instead the city won for itself the rather ambiguous name of Protestant Rome, This designation of times long past is now all but forgotten. At that time, however, and up to the eighteenth century, it was chiefly meant to distinguish Geneva as the foremost international center of Protestantism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The effects of Calvinism made themselves felt beyond the boundaries of its cradle in Switzerland, reaching into Germany, France, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary and North America (by way of the Puritans, the Pilgrim Fathers and all the Presbyterian denominations). Calvin shared the views of Zwingli, the Zurich reformer, ,who had openly advocated the use of the sword, to safeguard the liberty of proclaiming the gospel in every country. Calvin, too, coupled teaching the Bible with political activity; and so radical were his proceedings right from the outset that, in 1538, he was banished from the already reformed city of Geneva, two years after his first appointment. In 1541 he was recalled and they agreed to submit to his severe discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Though it must not be overlooked that in the minds of historians and theologians alike the term </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">theocracy</span><span class="font11"> has lost</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">W'T'HIS city is under the rule of God,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">X </span><span class="font11">was the solemn announcement delivered once again by a lean-faced, fiery-eyed preacher, to the councilors of a tiny city-republie bordering on the kingdom df France and the duchy of Savoy on February 11, 1557. That city was Geneva, now world famous as seat of the International Red Cross organization, former seat of the League of Nations, and scene of many international conferences in recent decades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The man who claimed that city of Geneva for the rule of God and wanted to remodel it into a &quot;holy city” was John Calvin, a reformer mentioned in the same breath with Luther, Zwingli and other champions of the anti-Romish movement in the sixteenth century. John Calvin, a Frenchman, born in 1509 at Noyon in northern France, fled from the French Catholic inquisition after his sudden * conversion to the Evangelical faith in 1533. In 1536 he came to Geneva and made it his home. Nineteen years before, the Reformation had started in Germany; and fourteen years before, in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The foremost Swiss reformer, Ulrich Zwingli, had been slain in battle against the Catholics five years previously. In the Pays de Vaud, Neuchatel and Geneva, French-speaking territories which afterwards joined the Swiss Confederation, the reform movement had likewise forged its way since 1530, thanks to the activities of Fare! and Viret. Hence this means that Calvin had not planted, but had watered. He was a man of great learning, a brilliant and fascinating writer. It was he that gave the city of Geneva its quite distinctive character in those early decades of the Reformed Church. For what purpose? We quote from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Le Siecle de la Reforme a Geneve </span><span class="font11">by Alexandre Guillot:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He [Calvin] realized the particular situa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">its true sense, the fact still remains that Calvin wanted to imitate the typical Theocracy of Israel. According to him, the powers of church and state should join hands, in order to enforce the rule of God among men. Claiming preeminence for the church, he changed Geneva virtually into a</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>State of the Church</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Clergymen now serve as counselors and controllers in all departments of the republic’s administration. The clergy as a body is given the title of ‘'Venerable Company&quot;, The citizenry, one section after another, is summoned to the cathedral, to take the oath of allegiance to the new organization and the new creed. Church attendance is made compulsory. Those who for any reason are excluded from the Lord’s supper no longer enjoy full civic rights. Adultery is punishable by death, as in Israel. Ranking next to the 'Venerable Company”, the ‘&quot;Court of Elders” is established as another authority, made up of six clergymen and twelve laymen, appointed by the city council. The city is subdivided into twelve sections, a slight reminder of the new Jerusalem described in Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Each of these sections was under the supervision of one clergyman and one layman. They observed the merchant in his hall, the craftsman in his workshop and the market-woman on the street. They took notice of these peopled words and deeds, taking into account the following, Are they diligently attending the sermons, not only on Sundays ? Do they regularly and devotedly partake of the Lord’s supper! How do they dress? How’do they faring up their children? Are they thrifty, or are they wasteful and pleasure-seeking! The home of every citizen, whether of high or low standing, was to be held open to those supervisors, whose duty it was to visit every home at least once a year. [Quoted from VVie </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">die 'Waadt und genf fur die Schweiz und den neuen Glctuben gewonnen wurden</span><span class="font11"> (How Vaud and Geneva were wan for Switzerland and the New Faith), by Dr. Arnold Jaggi.j</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“What a police state c someone may exclaim in objection to such an arrangement ‘Does not God want voluntary worshipers?” Well, Calvin had no use for such notions-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As is well known, Calvin does not accept the liberty of man, which is excluded from his theological and social system. Man is left no -choice to accept God’s rule. ... fn his [Calvin’s] eyes the honor of God is upheld if man is prostrated before the divine law in a voluntary or compulsory way. [Quoted from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">La Thfocratie</span><span class="font11"> 4 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Geneve au temps de Calvin </span><span class="font11">(The Theocracy in Geneva at the time of Calvin), by E. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ChOisyJ</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The frequenting of public houses was forbidden; pageants or dances likewise. Only Biblical names were allowed for children. For having reproached Calvin in the privacy of his home, a councilor was forced to go through the city with nothing on him save his shirt, and to apologize on bended knqes. A preacher who objected to this measure was ruthlessly put out of office. No other reading matter but the Bible and edifying writings were permitted, to the exclusion of all novels. A hairdresser was imprisoned because she made ah unauthorized coiffure for a young lady. A card player was exposed as an example of public abhorrence in the pillory, with the cards hung around his neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Little wonder when Maxime Reymond in his </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la Suisse</span><span class="font11"> (History of Switzerland) remarks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not that he [Calvin] was beloved; he was dreaded and could master the various and repeated insubordinations only by punishing them with inexorable inflexibility. . . . It is found that from 1542 to 1546 seventy-six persons were sentenced to banishment and fifty-eight were sentenced to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Typical is the following excerpt from a letter by Calvin, dated February1559, and addressed to the Bernese town clerk Zurkinden:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">'Withal, you art not at aft rrhndinJ oi the great damage to the Church, caused by your lenient kindliness, that lets the wicked go unpunished for everything. Having only a spark of piety within us, a severe blasphemy must ignite us to full anger. Jn that case I would rather rage to the utmost, than to be found too lenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Religious fervor and intolerance join hands in the Calvin creed, as in many other, cases. Though a reformer, he was still held prisoner within the sinister world of ideas prevailing in the dark Middle Ages, He expressly adhered to the decrees of the earlier church councils, the Nieean council, for example, as binding upon all Christians, and fervently defended Trinitarianism. He believed that God had fixed beforehand the fate of every man, choosing some for salvation and some for perdition; and that he made that somber and disgraceful doctrine of predestination the center of his theological system has certainly contributed to his policy of harshness. He advocated putting to death all heretics by carnal weapons of the worldly powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Standing as a monument of guilt is the shameful crime committed on Michael Servetus, a Spanish physician and author of reformed writings, who saw that baptism of babes and the doctrine of the trinity are against the Bible. Sentenced to be burned alive at the stake by the Papist inquisition in France, he &quot;managed to escape to Geneva, only to be arrested at the instigation of Calvin and sentenced-to death for his “heresy” It is said that Calvin was to have him executed by the sword; instead he was roasted alive at the stake for 30 minutes, which means that the government of the reformed Genevan State of the Church literally executed the sentence of the Roman inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Considering the fruits and the outcome of that experiment, the answer is clearly evident that Geneva was not a Theocracy, not a city of God, not a holy city,—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> correspondent in Switzerland.</span></p>

He backed the civil rights program against lynching, poll taxes, racial segregation and discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such were the president's ''fair deal&quot; proposals. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font8"> called It a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">sweeping </span><span class="font8">new deal. The Democratic National chairman said it was the “strongest possible bulwark against Communism in this country&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In his economic report the president elaborated on these matters, putting forward also (he proposal that Industry and government Join to provide a million new Jobs.,</span></p>

McDermott, said: “The practical steps leading up to such an arrangement are now receiving the most Intensive consideration on both </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sides of the Atlantic. It is natural that such supplies as may be available should go to countries associated with us In collective defense arrangements,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jews in the News</span></p>

At the beginning of the month the Jewish army had forced most of the Egyptian forces tn the Negeb back into Egypt and actually entered Egyptian territory. Egypt made overtures for a peace settlement and a truce was concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Britain’s Bevin, who once told the House of Comnkins, “I will stake my political future on solving this problem,&quot; did not seem to be doing-so well with the Palestine situation, The Jews said the British were aiding the Egyptians. but the British maintain the incident took plnce over Egypt lari territory, A strong protest in the Jewish government was returned as “Improperly ftd-’dressed”. The British provided reinforcements for the garrison at the Trans-Jordau port of Aqaba, near the Negeb border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Jews remained In the news not only by shrewd moves In the field of battle, but also by full-page “advertisements” In U.S. papers, one of which was headed “Britain’s New War Against Israel”. Therein Britain’s claimed intention to act Independently of the U. N. was decried. Britain was called the real enemy of Israel. Dr. Chaim Weizmann, provisional president of Israel, expressed his concern over developments, warning the British that their course would lead to war. He continued to hope for peace with Britain. Meanwhile Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, acting U N, mediator, sought to bring about peace not only between Israel and Egypt, but also the Arab states of Trans-Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. The Jews and the Egyptians agreed to hold back their military actions while the peace talks were being held on the island of Rhodes.</span></p>

The Vatican insisted the clergy must be allowed to manage its own schools. It was reported that Hungary had ruled that henceforth all Roman Catholic clergy would be paid by the government, a provision made after the nationalisation of al) schools. The Vatican charged that the arrest of Mfndszenty came at the behest of Moscow’. In theU. S. the K, of C. urged (January 15) that the U. S. demand the cardinal’s release. Hungarian Protestants stated that Cardinal Mlndszenty was acting as a political leader, not a religious one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">&lt;$&gt; An “atomic clock&quot; has been </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">invented </span><span class="font8">which has a potential accuracy of one part-in 10,000,-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">000,</span><span class="font8">OCX), so that it would take about 3,000,000 years for the clock to gain or lose a second. The face of the clock is like any electric clock, but it has an atomic attachment that serves as a regulator. It consists of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">30-foot copper tube filled with ammonia gas, a quartz crystal oscillator </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and some </span><span class="font8">electronic instruments known as frequency multipliers, dividers and discriminators. The oscillator emits a radio signal of marvellously consistent frequency. Yet minute variations occasionally appear, which in the atomic clock are continually corrected by the frequency of the atomic vibrations in the ammonia molecule. The clock was developed by the National Bureau of Standards from research conducted by Dr. Harold Lyons, chief of the micro wave standards section.</span></p>
