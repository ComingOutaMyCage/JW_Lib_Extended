<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">MISSING LINKS STILL MISSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Articles In the two preceding luuet presented facta that proved the evolution theory to be old-fashioned, that It originated In heathen religion and mythology and ancient Greek philosophy, that it* supposed proofs of comparative anatomy, blood tests, embryology and vestigial organs are wanting in honest weight. Even evolution's star witness, geology, was found to backfire and. Instead of proving evolution, proved the unchangeability of species. This article continues the case, cross-examines geology to discover It an Incompetent witness for evolution, and thence calle to the witness stand some of evolution's famous &quot;missing links’’. They are exposed as guilty of perjury, forced by their finders to be false witnesses. But most amazing, ^thousands upon thousands of the missing links needed to complete evolution’s chain of evidence are still missing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">W</span><span class="font14">HEN evolutionists, speak of the missing link, as though there were only one link missing, they are being coy. There are untold thousands of links needed to connect modern man with a slimy mud puddle of millions of years ago. They cannot forge a single link to connect any two of the thousands pf natural species. More embarrassing to them, they cannot even produce a starting point for their evolutionary chain reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Ancient advocates of evolution thought they had the answer. They taught spontaneous generation. Aristotle, for instance, believed that fleas, worms, mice, dogs and other lower forms of animal life sprung up spontaneously from moist “Mother Earth”. Van Helmont, renowned alchemist physician during the reign of Louis XIV, wrote: “The smells which arise from the bottom of morasses produce frogs, slugs, leeches, grasses and other things.” When Sir Thomas Browne doubted spontaneous generation, another scientist of that day berated his unorthodoxy: “To question this is to question reason, sense, and experience.” But this folly that life was generated in putrefying matter was exploded in 1668 by Redi, an Italian, who discovered that maggots appeared in meat only after flies had deposited their eggs in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When the microscope revealed the existence of bacteria (1683) the evolutionists insisted that'it was the microscopic organisms that spontaneously generated from inanimate matter, to give life and evolution a start. But Pasteur, in 1846, proved that the bacteria did not originate themselves out of dead matter but came from other bacteria already existing there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then some starry-eyed evolutionists came forward with the wise opinion that the first bit of life came to earth from another planet, transported on a bit of star dust This fantasy only pushes the problem farther away, and means that man and all other life evolving from this star-dust passenger are “out of this world”. Ernest Haeckel stubbornly championed spontaneous generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Many evolutionists, like Darwin, acknowledge their failure to account for the beginning. Darwin said: “I imagine</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">that probably all organic beings which ever lived on this earth descended from some primitive form which was first called into life by the Creator/’ To admit one or a few creations is to admit the possibility of thousands. Hence the majority of evolutionists simply avoid the question of how life began. They cannot connect the inanimate with the animate. The very vital first link of their evolution chain is a missing link. They are as futile and ridiculous as a contractor that would try to skip the first floor and start to build a hundred-story skyscraper from the second floor up.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Evolutionists Explain Evolution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">But granting evolutionists the starting point they cannot explain, how did the one-celled beginning evolve to manhood!</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490308_files/g_E_19490308-3.png" alt="" style="width:61pt;height:65pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Several explanations have been given, and generally discarded. More than a century ago the French evolutionist Lamarck theorized on the “how&quot; of evolution, In different environments and by different activity the body of creatures acquired new characteristics, and Lamarck said these acquired characteristics were passed op to offspring. To illustrate, he explained how the giraffe got its long neck. Its ancestors had short necks, grazed on the ground. A drought came, the grass went, the giraffe ancestors reached to the trees for fodder, and stretched their necks. Each giraffe generation acquired longer necks, till they reached present proportions. Sounds like an Uncle Kemus tale. The drought must have lasted for millions of years’, for evolution takes its time. Why other grazing animals did not acquire long necks or starve is beneath Lamarck’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The fallacy of Lamarck’s theory is that acquired characteristics are not inherited by offspring. One evolutionist, Weismann, chopped the tails off mice for many generations, but the last had tails as long as the first. He learned that when the embryo was still in early stages of development the germ cells were set aside, thereafter, all. through life retained their original qualities, and, since out of these germ cells come all future generations, Weismann learned that inherited factors are fixed at this early stage. Hence Professor Kellogg, of Stanford University, once confessed concerning the inheritance of acquired characteristics, it &quot;‘unfortunately does not seem to happen”. Professor Conklin, of Princeton University, said; “The inheritance of acquired characters is inconceivable.” Today most evolutionists laugh at La* march’s theory. They have newer jokes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Darwin Shuns Lamarck’s Nonsense</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">Charles Darwin followed Lamarck with an explanation of his own, and said: “Heaven forfend me from Lamarck’s nonsense &quot;&nbsp;Darwin noticed variations in offspring </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">from the</span><span class="font14"> same parent, in size, shape, color. He also noted the struggle for existence. In this struggle, he said, the helpful variations’survived, the useless or less helpful ones perished. This is the basis for his theory of natural selection through survival of the fittest. Through a continuous selection of good variations evolution proceeded upward, said Darwin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Variation of characteristics already present is one thing, but to evolve an </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">organ</span><span class="font14"> entirely new is certainly more than Darwin’s slight variations. As Professor Lock, of Cambridge, said: “Selection, whether natural or artificial, can have no power in creating anything new.&quot; Hugo de Vries said: “Natural selection my explain the survival of the fittest, but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest,&quot; Professor Coulter, of the University of Chicago, says: “The most fundamental objection to the theory of natural selection is that it cannot originate characters; it only selects among characters already existing.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Darwin himself said: “Natural selection acts only by. the preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifi-nations.... If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Origin of Species,</span><span class="font14"> fifth edition, pp. 110,277) How could an eye, an ear, a heart or a lung develop by slight, accumulated modifications! Till complete, it would be useless; if useless, natural selection would not deem it fit to survive. In the rear part of spiders are highly specialized organs for spinning web, without which they could not catch food. WWI, How did they live through the millions of years these organs were evolving! If they gained food in other ways, why make the spinning organs! Natural selection would eliminate the useless, early modifications. If the mammary glands or breasts of animals that nurse their young evolved slowly over thousands or millions of years, how did the young survive during that time! If they were otherwise fed, why did the breasts, useless till complete, persist in developing! And how did sex organs, male'and female, perfect complements of each other, run in a parallel development till of some use millions of years later! How did reproduction take place in the meantime!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Darwin also stated, on page 63 of his </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Species:</span><span class="font14"> “We may be sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed.&quot; When the gills of water dwellers were changing to the lungs of land dwellers, when they were half-gill half-lung, how did the freak survive! When the evolving bird had only a third of a wing, or a half, or two-thirds, and could neither walk nor fly, would not this be injurious, and such modifications be destroyed as unfit to survive? The creature would be far better with a front paw than with something neither paw nor wing. Why would a practical process of evolution preserve a creature with neither wing nor paw nor fin, that could neither fly nor walk nor swim effectively, but could only flounder helplessly, unable to capture its food, prey to any meat-eater passing by! Such a freakish monstrosity could keep alive only in the evolutionist's imagination!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Darwin avoided Lamarck's nonsense, but fell into some of his own. Today most evolutionists cast off Darwin's folly. As John Burroughs wrote in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly,</span><span class="font14"> issue of August, 1920: “He [Darwin] has been shorn of his theory as completely as Samson was shorn of his locks.&quot; Dr. Scott of the British Association for the Advancement of Science put it: “A new generation has grown up that knows not Darwin.&quot;</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Geology Disproves Evolution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">Evolutionists are prone to point to the geological record in the rocks, to paleontology, as their star witness for evolution. But in the preceding issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> the leading article showed that fossils of living forms supposedly millions of years old were the same as life today. Geology showed only constancy of species, not change. Moreover, fossils of highly developed creatures appear suddenly in the strata of the earth, without simple ancestral forms. The fossil record in the earth's layers begins with what geologists term the Cambrian period, which is supposed to have started 550 million years ago. In layers immediately below these strata containing diversified and highly specialized fossils, there are no signs of life. It indicates a sudden beginning, even for complex living organisms, and not a slow evolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The evolutionists seek to duck from under this evidence for creation that disproves evolution by saying the layers underneath have been crumpled and altered, spoiling the fossil record. Some strata have, but many have not, and in these lower strata favorable for fossil formation are seen imprints of raindrops and ripple marks of waves, but no evidences of life. The fossil record testifies that the first bats were true bats, the first whales were true whales, the first birds had perfectly formed feathers, and the first insects were well developed, some monster dragonflies having a wingspan of nearly a yard</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Lacomte du Noiiy, internationally known French scientist, in his book Ha-</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">man Destiny,</span><span class="font14"> published in 1947 and hailed as brilliant on the theory of evolution, said: “Each group, order, or family seems to be born suddenly and we hardly ever find the forms which link them to the preceding strain. When we discover them they are already completely differentiated. Not only do we find practically no transitional forms, but in general it is impossible to authentically connect a new group with an ancient one.” He admits that reptiles appear suddenly, that they cannot be linked with any terrestrial ancestors, and makes the same admission regarding mammals. About birds he says they have “all the unsatisfactory characteristics of absolute creation<sup>0</sup>. (Pages 72, 75/79)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“The Earth</span><span class="font15"> /s a </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Liar!”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">The geological record does not support evolution. If evolution were true, life throughout the ages would have been drifting over in a continual stream from one form to another, taking millions of years to bridge species after species, and as untold millions of years passed new strata were being formed as fish became four-legged amphibians, which drifted over into reptiles, whose scales became feathers and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">front feet became wings, </span><span class="font14">while other reptiles and amphibians became mammals, apes and men. Yet as these changing creatures lived and died for hundreds of millions of years and new strata were being deposited, no fossil has been found that shows even one of the millions and trillions of necessary intermediate, transitional forms 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The reliable earth has preserved in fossil form millions of living creatures of species existing today, and many extinct ones but which are not transitional forms. Why so many fossils of so many different species of life that exist today, but never a fossil of an organ only partially developed! never a fossil of scales changing to feathersJ or feet into wings! or fish getting hind legs! or snakes sprouting fur! Darwin attempted a feeble answer: “Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graded organic chain; and this perhaps is the most obvious and serious objection which can be. urged against the theory. The explanation lies, however, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.’&quot; </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Origin of Species,</span><span class="font14"> vol. 2, p, 49, sixth edition) He accuses his star witness of holding out on him, not coming clean. He blames geology, rot his theory.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490308_files/g_E_19490308-4.png" alt="" style="width:65pt;height:65pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Evolutionists and geologists are further embarrassed by sometimes finding older fossil forms in the more recent earth layers and later fossil forms in older strata. When this happens and upsets their “geologic column” the scientists blame the earth, saying it has flipped the layers like a stack of pancakes, despite the fact that these layers are perfectly horizontal and cover thousands of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">square</span><span class="font14"> miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Actually, the difficulty lies in the fact that geology is founded upon the evolution theory. The ages of strata are fixed by the supposed age of the fossils in them, and the age of the fossils is fixed according to their place in the scale of evolution. If the fossilized life form is low in the evolutionary process, the earth layer containing it is declared old; if the life form is a late one, the stratum is recent. From the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Textbook of Geology, </span><span class="font14">vol. 2, p. 446, by Schuchert and Pirsson, we quote: “The fundamental principle underlying all endeavor to make out the geological past is evolution.” Geologists base their fantastic estimates of the age of earth's layers upon the even more fantastic theory of evolution. And when the earth itself fails to support their carefully but arbitrarily arranged se-quenoG of life as it is supposed to have evolved, according to their theory, they turn around and impeach their own witness, geology, and call the earth a liar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Before letting geology leave the witness stand, evolutionists would insist that its testimony in the case of the horse be heard. It is considered to be their strongest evidence. They have a series of fossil forms that they arrange to suit their fancy, beginning with a small fivetoed quadruped the size of a fox and ending with the modem horse. Many thousands of progressive links would be needed to show strong circumstantial evidence^ but the evolutionists offer a mere handful of fossils, and have not the slightest evidence of any genetic relationship existing aihong this handful. Dep^ret, an expert on fossil mammals, ridicules these supposed fossil ancestries of the modern horse, calling them “pretended pedigrees”, “deceitful delusions ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Because of the impossibility of highly specialized organs developing by accumulation of slight modifications over thousands of years, and because of the absence of transitional forms bridging species in the fossil record, some evolutionists declare the changes came fast and furious, in an orgy of big variations. In 1900 Hugo de Vries found new forms of primrose coming from bis experimental specimens. He concluded they were new species, and said: “New species rose suddenly, spontaneously, by steps, by jumps.” But these “mutations” were merely varieties of the old species. Professor William Bateson said: “We see nbvel forms appearing, but they are no new species . . . that which comes out is no new creation.&quot; Bnt other evolutionists, seeking to modify evolution to fit the facts, refuse to give up the sinking ship. Note the following by Austin H. Clark, biologist of the Smithsonian Institution when he wrote it for the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font14"> April 14, 1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is no evidence whatever of the existence of “inissiiig links&quot; between any two of the major groups of animals ... It is well to emphasize the fact that every developmental line has certain gape. In some lines these gaps are large and broad, while in others, as, for instance, in the horses, the gaps are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">relatively </span><span class="font12">small. But they are always there. They are therefore natural, and not due to a deficiency in the record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The same year the February 16 </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font14"> wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dr. Clark does not discard the theory of evolution ; he modifies it. Instead of evolution by a process of gradual development, he believes it has come about by a series of jumps from one major form of life to another. He expresses his views in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Quarterly Review of Biology,</span><span class="font12"> a publication which has a limited circulation in scientific circles. “So far as concerns the major groups of animals,” he says, “the creationists seem to have the better of the argument. There is not the slightest evidence that any one of the major groups arose from any other. Each is a special animal-complex, related more closely to all the rest and appearing, therefore, as a special and distinct creation.&quot; According to Dr Clark’s belief, “man appeared in the Pliocene age, just preceding the ice age. He appeared suddenly and in substantially the same form as he is in today. There is not the slightest evidence of his existence before that time. He appeared able to walk, able to think, and able to defend himself&quot; Dr. Clark holds that there are no missing links. “Missing links,&quot; he says, “are misinterpretations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This brings us to the famous &quot;missing links” to which the modern evolutionists point with pride and say, &quot;There is a half-man, half-ape.” But before examining these &quot;links”, the observation must be made that if evolution is proceeding by big jumps, we should easily see them now. The old theory of slow change could hide behind time and say we did nut live long enough to see the changes; but it was exposed by the fossil record. Now the new theory of big jumps eludes the need for intermediate forms and thus can live with paleontology, hut it falls into the snare of not being observable and cannot hide behind the skirts of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And since neither of these theories can live with the laws of heredity discovered by Gregor Mendel, other evolutionists have produced another “straw” to cling to. They say that the original first cell was packed with all the millions and millions of inheritance factors necessary to develop all the living types, colors, shapes, sizes and mentalities of creatures that followed. This means it was the most complicated of- all life, and that its factors split up to produce simpler forms. This fantasy makes the beginning of life all the more miraculous. Easier would it have been for simple man to have been spontaneously generated in some sea slime and thereafter evolve into a complex amoeba!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Evolution’s Link Between Man and Ape</span></h3>
<p><span class="font21">«</span><span class="font14"> Object!on may be raised to this subhead. True, most of the modern evolutionists no longer believe man descended from ape, but say hoth evolved from an unknown common ancestor farther down the evolution tree. Why the change! Because “man, apes and half-apes cannot be arranged </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font14"> a single ascending series of which man is the culmination”, as Mivart reveals in his book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Man and Apes.</span><span class="font14"> As knowledge increases evolutionists are forced to abandon speculation after speculation, as they have done since Darwin's day; and now they disown the monkey myth so long taught with such cocksure arrogance. Failing to make men of monkeys, they still make monkeys of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Moreover, they still persist in inferring man’s relationship to ape. It is the nearest they can come to making their argument by classification stick, namely, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">arrangement</span><span class="font14"> of skeletons according to resemblance, culminating in man. This method is as foolish as saying that when conditions Were favorable wind blew together some frees and metals and color pigments to form a shingle-roofed doghouse,. nailed together, door cut and roof and sides painted in nicely matching colors. Then, lining up after it bigger doghouses, small shacks, cottages, large houseSj mansions and castles, the foolish one says the castles evolved from the doghouses, because of the resemblance. And if you object to the analogy because all these items are inanimate, we ask, Would it not be easier for one inanimate object to evolve into another inanimate object than for the inanimate to evolve into animate, as evolution says!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That evolutionists cling to this folly is shown by exhibits, one of which appears at the Museum of Natural History m New York city. It lines up nine skulls, including such famous “missing links” as Pithecanthropus erectus (upstanding ape man), Piltdown man, Heidelberg man, Neanderthal man and Cro-Magnon man. Note the first one is named “ape man”. Now a new find is supposed to fit in after this ape-man, called Australopithecus, meaning “southern ape”. Why do they continue to name their “missing links” as part-ape part-man if they no longer contend man descended from ape! Why do they babble over new finds as half-ape half-man 1 Regardless of scattered objections, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">the belief is generally </span><span class="font14">prevalent that evolutionists teach that man came,from ape, and some evolutionists still believe it. In </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Science of Life,</span><span class="font14"> page 419, it is stated that H. G. Wells, G. P. Wells and Julian Huxley assure us concerning man's ancestors: “Four-footed, tailed and hairy it took </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font14">the Eocene forests; it grew into lemur, into monkey, into ape; and finally ape turned into man-ape, and man-ape grew to man?*</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Fooled by Bones and a Pig</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">There is no </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">need to detail the discoveries</span><span class="font14"> of a tooth here, a leg bone there, and a skull fragment somewhere else, all of which scattered rumors are brought together, sworn to belong together, and from which is constructed entire families of hunting ape-men. That is what evolutionists do with the six outstanding fossil types that supposedly prove the evolution of man. Of these six evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith says: “We may say at once that as geological record now stands, we cannot trace modem man backwards to any of these extinct types.” Though seldom publicized, the skulls of modern-type man have been found in many places and are older than these “missing links”. After mentioning this, Keith says: “The majority of anatomists and geologists . . . simply refuse to believe in the authenticity of these discoveries because they run so contrary to our preconceptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This shows that evolutionists will suppress evidence to prove their theory. Another outstanding example is Eugene Dubois' discovery of the Java ape-man. He told the scientific world about his “missing link” in 1894. The thigh bone and teeth seemed to be from man, but the skull seemed to be from ape. Since it was not known then that fossils of men were to be found in Java, the scientists thought they had a part-ape partman. It was twenty-six years later that Dubois confessed that at the same time he discovered his “missing link” he found fossils of human skulls, a big-brained type called Wadjak man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This, plus the fact that modern-type human skulls older than the six famous “missing links” have been found, plus the fact that similar modern skulls older than the more recently famous “southern ape” are known, brushes these fake links, which are degenerated humans or are similar to the giants found in the land of Canaan when Israel entered, from the scales on which we weigh evolution's evidence. With true men existing before these hazy concoctions by prejudiced evolutionists, these vaunted</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“missing links” cannot be links between man and ape, or any other animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The assertions of evolutionists cannot be swallowed as scientific truth, as evidenced by the tooth found in Nebraska in 1922. It was the tooth of an ancient man that fitted in with evolution, scientists claimed. In 1925 the American Museum of Natural History declared: “Every suggestion made by scientific skeptics was weighed and i -55 found wanting.” Then in 1928 CjkiSkfr the museum admitted it was a pig’s tooth. Fooled by a pig!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>More Misting than Links</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">This series of articles has shown that evolution is missing in true scientific evidence. It is a theory springing from pagan antiquity. It is taught by men highly esteemed in this world, is supported by the tyranny of “experts and authorities”. Unproved, it is accepted because of the big names that propagate it It is missing a starting point, intermediate links, and final link. The gap separating man and ape or any other animal of the evolutionist's choice is the widest of the whole chain, and, though the link should be recent and its trail fresh, the evolutionists cannot track it down or even get its faint scent. The tremendous gap remains, yawning in boredom at the futile efforts of evolutionists to bridge it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And if they,had barrels and barrels of links, links do not make a connected chain till forged together, just as a pile of bricks do not make a building until assembled by an intelligent creature. None of the required proofs have evolution's ballyhooers been able to produce. They have retreated from one speculation after another, from inheritance of acquired characteristics, from natural selection and survival of the fittest, from slow changes, from fast changes, from proof by classification, comparative anatomy, embryology, geology or paleontology, blood tests, vestigial organs, and some more sensible evolutionists are eyen abandoning the infamous “missing links<sup>51</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But missing most from the theory is common sense and reason. A wild flood of nonsense spues out on every hand, a deluge of assertions that is an insult to intelligence. A British evolutionist gets his name in the paper by saying future men will be chinless and toothless because of‘the soft foods man is eating. In tile dim past men, or their ancestors, were supposed to be practically chinless. Is evolution going in circles? Or is it the evolutionists? Another spouts that in time man’s foot will become toeless because he wears shoes. Maybe in time he will be born with shoes on, a gift from evolution. Judging by the way. some teachers of evolution avoid thinking, ,.nd the way their thoughtless mouthings are swallowed by unthinking multitudes, men might soon be born brainless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In a more sinister strain, Julian Huxley urges that man guide evolution in producing supermen. In his book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Man in the Modern World</span><span class="font14"> he says t “It is now open to man and woman to consummate the sexual function with those they love, but to fulfill the reproductive function with those whom on perhaps quite other grounds they admire.” He would select the human “stallions” and “brood mares” to save the race. “Humanity will gradually destroy itself from within, will decay in its very core and essence, if this slow but relentless process is not checked. . . . We must be able to pick out the genetically inferior stocks with more certainty, and we must set in motion counterforces making for faster reproduction of superior stocks, if we are to reverse or even arrest the trend.” (Pages 58,60) Alas! cannot evolution continue to evolve humanity upward, Mr. Huxley? Has it suddenly quit, after getting us where we are? And does not this program have a familiar ring? Did not Hitler set out to produce a super race, sterilizing undersirables, and overbreeding the “superior stocks”? Would</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Huxley breed humans like animals in the stables of the state?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Amazing is the mad delirium of Le-comte du Noiiy, when he makes Christ Jesus a foretaste of evolution's future glories: “He [man] will prove that he is the forerunner of the future race, the ancestor of the spiritually perfect man, of which Christ was, in a sense, the premature example, by emerging victorious from the fight. Thus Christ can be assimilated to one of the intermediary, transitional forms, perhaps a million years in advance of evolution, Who came amongst us to keep us from despair, and to prove to us that our efforts can and must succeed/' </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Hmnan Destiny,</span><span class="font14"> p. 117) After that, everyone should agree that</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Evolution Is a Sinking Ship</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">Rats have sense enough to abandon a sinking ship. However, most evolution teachers, like sea captains, choose to go down with the ship, and, unlike sea captains, want everyone else to go down with it also. There are hundreds of statements made by scientists, many of whom are evolutionists, that show their belief that evolution never has been proved and never will be, that neither in nature nor by artificial breeding experiments have new species been produced. Unreliable Julian Huxley claims they have, but the only instances he gives is where a new variety. of poppy was produced from two other poppies, a new variety of ricegrass from other rice-grasses, and a new variety of dog from other dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Actually, the findings of true </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">L-Lj</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> I <sup>sc</sup>^<sup>eiice</sup> </span><span class="font14">P<sup>r(</sup>J<sup>ve</sup> the Bible account of Genesis. Science confirms </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EMiMH </span><span class="font14">the order of appearance of different types of life as given in Genesis the first chapter. The mathematical odds of Moses' accidentally guessing this order is one chance in millions. If man had been on earth for a million years, as evolution teaches, there would be trillions of inhabitants by now, or the earth would be a veritable boneyard. But for the period from the Noachian flood the world population of a little more than two billion is reasonable. The Genesis account shows the unchangeableness of species, which the fossil record confirms. Geology also shows complex living organisms appearing suddenly, as would be the case in creation. Creation makes possible insects wiser through God-given instinct than monkeys and apes, whereas evolution would demand increasing wisdom as life approached nearer to man*</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Man's creation in God's image harmonizes with his ability to, reason, determine right and wrong, manifest conscience, hold dominion over animals; in short, it explains the tremendous gulf between man and animal. It dovetails with science's discovery that men of all races came from one pair originally, that civilization of a high order appears suddenly, that the oldest languages are the most complex, giving no hint of evolving from animal grunts and growls. Huxley notes man's degeneration, which is the opposite of evolution. The Bible report of man’s fall from perfection and subsequent degeneration accounts for it. Science has said man uses but a small percentage of his marvelous brain. Evolution would not have evolved so much unused &quot;gray matter&quot;, but perfect man had it for use in the beginning, though degenerate man does not now use it fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Bible account fits so perfectly with the facts of true science; evolution is a misfit on every front. It cannot bridge the gap between the inanimate and animate, between the vegetable and animal, between asexual and sexual, between the large animal groups. It cannot even link two species. It can only assume and assert, speculate and theorize* It cannot prove. Its supporters will not accept the burden of proof, but want it swallowed on their &quot;expert&quot; say-so. And any who do not are ignoramuses, they say. But when their &quot;proofs&quot; are put on the scales the indicator does not move. Nothing will always weigh nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Evolutionists are not on the horns of one dilemma, but on the horns of dozens of dilemmas. Satan has pinned them there. He has revived this ancient theory of pagan antiquity. Why! To deceive men in these &quot;last days&quot;. To blind minds to the Creator. To darken foolish hearts. To make a fool of the world, since by embracing evolution the world says there is no Almighty God. True Christians will not swallow Satan’s pill, not even after the apostate clergy of Christendom sugarcoat it and extend it from their pulpits. True Christians will prove all things, and hold fast only to that which is good. They will gaze at the star-studded heavens and contemplate the ^reen earth wifli its teeming life of infinite variety, and marvel andT rejoice at such visible reflections of the invisible Creator’s unlimited wisdom and power* His truth will free them of the pagan myth of evolution. They will take Jehovah God’s advice: &quot;Have nothing to do with godless and silly myths/'—1 Timothy 4: 7, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Standard Version.</span></p>

From Turkey to Afghanistan the peasants pretty up their horses and donkeys by dabbing henna on their tails, though the primary purpose is to bring good luck. And when heading for Iran, don't pluck your eyebrows, as it is a mark of beauty there to have one long eyebrow extending across the forehead instead of two separated by a hairless space above the nose.

<p><span class="font10">C, Do you know why a permanent wave waves hair permanently! Listen to the answer by the originator of the cold permanent wave: “Certain changes take place in the molecular arrangement of the hair structure to cause the fixation of the strain or wave. Owing to the water-absorption capacity of hair, the presence of the water in the waving process materially assists the stretching of the hair and thus facilitates the uneven strain on one side of the strand. With the newer types of cold-wave materials the hair is treated with an alkaline reducing agent which splits the disulphide linkages in the molecules of the keratin Structure of the hair. As the hair strands are under strain when rolled in the curlers, the splitting of the disulphide linkages allows a reorientation of the keratin polypeptide chains; when a suitable wave has thus developed the reduced hair is treated with an oxidizing agent to fix the wave permanently.” And even though you still don’t know the answer, just hearing it is enough to make your hair curl. Incidentally, some may be interested to know that last summer the Foibd and Drug Administration announced that cold permanent waves were safe. After tests on animals had been conducted for two and a half years and consumer complaints had been checked, the bureau was unable to find any indication of serious injury caused by the cold permanent wave treatment. Stories about harm to health and sight were branded unfounded rumors, The bureau did admit, however, that some allergies may exist to certain chemicals used.

<p><span class="font14">Mrs. Tillie Evans on the rough kit eh’ en table and strapped her down with heavy belts. She was to be operated on for the removal of a diseased ovary. Rolling up his sleeves the surgeon gave last-minute instructions to his burly assistants that stood by, picked up a razorsharp knife, and made a skillful cut with the speed of lightning. A shattering scream split the air. Writhing and twisting with agony poor Tillie shrieked until she fainted, and stopped breathing. The swift-racing fingers of the surgeon never hesitated, but continued to fight against time. Five minutes later he completed the job and sewed up the incision* Almost like a miracle Tillie was revived and lived. Her nerves improved but there were deeper wounds that never healed* The terrific strain had injured her heart, and the lack of oxygen for several minutes, when she stopped breathing under the shock of the knife, permanently damaged the sensitive brain tissues. As a consequence she was mentally dull and forgetful the rest of her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Such is the story, as told by Morton M. Hunt in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Science Illustrated</span><span class="font14">, of surgery a hundred years ago without anesthetics. In those days most people chose to die of their maladies rather than undergo an operation. Success depended not so much on the surgeon's speed and the assistants' strength as it did on the patient's iron nerves and recuperative powers. How different today I</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There are many modern anesthetics which, when used in combination, enable even frail individuals to receive the bene</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">fits of surgery. For example, a spinal injection benumbs only the area in which the operation is to be performed, without blacking out the mind. Nor does the surgeon need to</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">rush; he can take all the time needed, three hours or more, to do a thorough job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How different, these methods, from the old tourniquet that was applied to the carotid arteries on either side of the neck to produce temporary unconsciousness. Modern benumbing methods are also a far cry from the chewing of coca leaves by the Peruvian Incas, the opium and alcohol of a few centuries ago, and the ancient pain-killing juices of the Greeks. Much of the analgesias cooked up by the medieval alchemists was nothing more than “a mixture of mythology and wishful thinking&quot;, to quote Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Sir Humphrey Davy of England first learned ’of the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide on April 9,1799, but to him it was only a plaything of the laboratory. He called it “laughing gas&quot;. In 1818 Faraday learned that ether, chemically called ethyl oxide and obtained from the reaction of ethyl alcohol and sulphuric acid, produced an effect similar to that of nitrous oxide. Godman in 1822, Jackson in 1833 and Wood and Bache in 1834, all demonstrated the same thing, yet nitrous oxide and ether remained “scientific curiosities&quot; until March 30, 1842, when Dr. C. W. Long of Georgia gave John Venable ether before removing a tumor from his neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In 1844 Horace Wells, himself a dentist, took nitrous oxide and had a friend pull his wisdom tooth. That made news. Then Dr. W. T. G. Morton performed the first public operation under ether before a group of medical skeptics on October 16, 1846. The next year Sir James</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Simpson, of Scotland, became the first to use chloroform to alleviate the pain of childbirth. Later on Carter, Lockett and Henderson of Canada added two more anesthetics to the list: ethylene and cyclopropane.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Different Types of Pain-Killers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">Anesthetics are classified as local, regional and general, according to the area affected. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Local,</span><span class="font14"> the simplest type, numbs the external sensory nerves in the immediate area surrounding its application. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Regional</span><span class="font14"> anesthetics cause loss of pain to larger areas, such as the lower limbs or an arm; whereas </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font14"> anesthesia completely blots out all mental consciousness and bodily sensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Local anesthesia by freezing is widely used. No, the patient is not placed in a refrigerator or set on a cake of ice. Instead, liquid oxygen or ethyl chloride is sprayed on the local area, as, for example, on an infected finger that must be lanced. The; only drawback with this method is the same painful ordeal as ex<sub>r </sub>perienced with frostbite, namely, the thawing out period. It was the doctors of Napoleon's army that first observed that half-frozen soldiers did not suffer to the same degree as warm ones when amputations were made, hut until recently freezing of a whole limb was not thought possible. This is now common practice. No other anesthesia is given, the suffering is very little, and recovery is quick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Numbing of the nerves is also done with certain drugs. Just when the alkaloid of cocaine was first isolated from the coca leaves, the same coca leaves chewed by the'Inca Indians, is not definite, but it was at some time around 1860. Since then related chemicals, such as novocaine, eucaine, tropacocaine and others, being less toxic, have largely replaced cocaine, which is a very powerful heart depressant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The nervous system of the human body is like &amp;&nbsp;transcontinental network of telegraph lines, with the individual nerves feeding into main trunk lines that lead to the central nerve channel in the spinal column, which in turn carries the impulses to the brain. If, instead of injecting the anesthetic in a local area, the drug is placed as a nerve-block along one of the main trunk lines, then a much larger region is made senseless. Or, if the injection is put in the spinal fluid, the lower half of the body can be put to sleep without affecting the brain or upper part of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Though Bier in 1898 and Fourneau in 1904 demonstrated the effectiveness of spinal analgesia, it was not widely used until better methods and techniques of application were learned. Nerve-blocks and spinal injections have many advantages. The patient remains conscious, and hence can cough, swallow and move different parts of the body. Nausea, vomiting and thirst are reduced. Their disadvantages include a certain degree of risk of paralysis, severe headaches and limitation. to operations below the second rib. If injected too high in the spinal column they interfere with the breathing. Individuals who are so sentimental and emotional that they frighten easily in the atmosphere of the operating room mijst be given anesthetics that knock them completely out of this conscious world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Scopolamine and morphine, at one time used to produce “twilight sleep” during childbirth, are now obsolete. “Continuous caudal” injection, a modification of spinal anesthesia, is the latest and most successful method used to ease the pain of delivery. Instead of a large dosage being given at one time, the analgesia is trickled into the spinal fluid at the base of the spine over a period of time.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Knocking Out both Pain and Patient</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">General anesthesia, where complete muscular relaxation, unconsciousness and the absence of all sense and feeling is obtained, is still the most common type used by the surgeons. It is administered either by inhalation of vaporous gases of ether, chloroform, nitrous oxide, ethylene, cyclopropane, or by oil-ether enemas or rectal injections of tribromo-ethanol, or by hypodermic injections of barbituric acid compounds, such as evi-pal, pernocten or sodium pentothal. Each one of these anesthetics has its particular merits and disadvantages, and each method of application has its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Sodium pentothal, outside the hospital, has gained quite a reputation during recent years as “truth serum&quot;. But have no fear! You won’t start telling the truth on the operating table, because as a “truth serum” a very weak solution must be given. When sodium pentothal is injected as an anesthetic the patients are told to count, “one, two, three . . . ”, and in the majority of cases they pass out somewhere between 10 and 20 counts. Its effectiveness lasts only about twenty minutes, and by itself it is good only for short operations^ For anon cases it is very good, for it causes none of the aftereffects produced by efher. One of its uses, however, is to conquer the fighting patient that fears the operating room or dislikes the smell of ether. Given a shot of sodium pentothal his consciousness and “fight” are blown out like a candle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sleeping Through the “Black-out”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With the use of anesthetics there are so many dangers beyond the first stages of drowsiness that the whole subject has become a study of specialists that call themselves anesthesiologists. They take much of the credit for successful operations. These boys that specialize in blacking out pain must watch the patient’s heartbeat, blood pressure and breathing during the operation. In fact, anesthetics bring one very close to the door of death. After the first stage of semidrowsiness the patient passes through an “excitement” stage into the third stage called surgical sleep. In this stage there are four levels, the first being marked by a complete loss of sensation, and the last by a paralysis of the heart and lungs, where one’s life can be measured out in seconds. At these low levels a patient’s Life is often dangled by a thin thread while the surgeon performs a delicate operation in or near the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Still very much in the exploratory stage, medical science and research is ever groping, ever probing after new and better anesthetics. Not so long ago it was learned that ephedrine, an extract taken from the same plant as the old Chinese drug </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">ma haung,</span><span class="font14"> is useful in prolonging the effectiveness of other spinal anesthetics. Dibenamine and tetraethyl ammonium are among the newer nerveblocking agents. Radioactive products of the cyclotron have been used to produce dibromo procaine of anesthesia value. Five years ago it was learned that the poison arrows of the fierce Orinoco Indians of South America quickly paralyzed the victims without killing them. Medical men found the arrows were tipped with a powerful drug called curare, and since then they have been studying its usefulness as a muscle-relaxing anesthetic. Another line of research has. shown that temporary insensibility to feeling is obtained where a stream of ultrasonic high-frequency inaudible sound waves is trained on a local area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Humanity too can be thankful that the screaming and struggling under the surgeon’s knife are no longer necessary. But Morton Hunt goes too far in praising these pain-killing drugs in the conclusion of his article in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Science Illustrated,</span><span class="font14"> He talks as rashly as one coming out from under the ether when he says that anesthetics “have already made true on earth the prophecy of Revelation: 'Neither shall there be pain any more? ” What Revelation 21:1-5 is describing are the conditions that will prevail under the rule of “a new heaven and a new earth”, God’s righteous and perfect Theocratic Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">VENEZUELA’S</span></p><img src="g_E_19490308_files/g_E_19490308-6.png" alt="" style="width:310pt;height:132pt;">
<p><span class="font21">N</span><span class="font14">EW governments as well as new looks are the style these days. Not to be outmoded by her South and Central American sisters, Venezuela recently decided to change her style of government. So sudden and perfectly executed was the change that Hitler himself would have gaped in open admiration. Just one short hour, yes, quicker than madame could shed her short skirt and put on the new, the blitzkrieg coup was effected in Venezuela, on Wednesday, November 24 of 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although sudden, the change was not altogether unexpected. A few days before rumors were flying and an accident occurred which set the people’s nerves on edge more than the revolution itself. Two days before the coup a policeman in the city of Caracas accidentally fired his gun. Consternation broke loose. People scurried in every direction. Iron gratings and doors slammed shut on all the stores. Even the bus service was stopped. Fist fights took place in the streets while the police were working frantically to restore order and assure the people that all was well. Traffic faded from the downtown section, leaving the busy metropolis of Caracas as quiet as a “ghost town”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But why so jittery over just one gunshot? The answer is that the revolution just three years ago was still fresh in their minds. They well remembered the gun fights in the streets and deadly machine-gunning planes overhead. Many innocent victims lost their lives in the cross fire. Yes, three years from one </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">MARCH 8, 1949</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">revolution to another is rather a short space of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That revolt against the government occurred on the 18th of October of 1945 when President Isaias Medina Angarita was ousted from power. The army, under the leadership of Lt. Colonel Marcos Perez Jimenez, were the ones responsible for the revolution. They established a provisional government under the leadership of Romulo Betancourt. On October 27, 1946, an election was held for a Constituent Assembly and the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Action Democrática</span><span class="font14"> party won by a large margin. December 14,1947, was the date set for the presidential election. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Action Democrática</span><span class="font14"> won with overwhelming odds with their candidate, Romulo Gallegos, an outstanding novelist of Venezuela. A few months later with a big parade and celebration he was inaugurated into office while diplomats were in attendance from many different nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This was something new or at least different for the Venezuelan people, and they looked forward to a progressive era with their newly formed democratic government ■ and constitution. A few months passed and rumors began to circulate in the streets: the government was not fulfilling its promises, it was a one-party government with all benefits for the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Action Democrática</span><span class="font14"> party, the people were becoming dissatisfied with the continued high cost of living, and so on. Another important rumor was that certain leaders in the army wanted more voice in the running of the government. Talk of a revolution increased while </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Action Democrática</span><span class="font14"> began to lose its power among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On November 17, 1948, army leaders had a long conference with the president asking him to make some changes in ministers and state governors and to give the army four cabinet posts and four governorships. Gallegos did nothing. After further advances were made to Gallegos with no result the army experts decided to remodel or change the style of government. Time magazine of December 6, 1948, states: “The Arrtiy gave Venezuela its first Democratic Government and the Army took it away.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Army Takes Over</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">The public first realized the army was taking over when the radio at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday the 24th cut short its commercial and the announcer yelled excitedly, “Attention everyone! The army is taking over the government.” Then the radio was silent Almost immediately army tanks bristling with guns raced into the downtown squave, soldiers in full battle dress were sta-tioned at every corner throughout the city of Caracas. Simultaneously every other city in Venezuela was taken over by the army. It was rather, a strange feeling io walk down the street with soldiers pointing the business ends of machine guns, high-powered rifles, or shotguns at your midriff. Citizens were ordered to get on the first bus or taxi and go home. No one argued with them. The radio now under the army warned the people of a six-o'clock curfew, while a violation of it would mean arrest or one might he shot on sight</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All rights of the citizens were suspended, theaters closed, no public meetings of any kind were permitted, although the Catholic Church held mass on Sunday morning-.The right to sell and buy liquor was suspended and the bars were closed. During the nine days of prohibition the people of Caracas </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">saved </span><span class="font14">600,000 bolivares or 20,000 dollars according to the Caracas </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font14"> of December 13,1948. Gunfire broke the silencte the first few nights, disturbing those who slept lightly. November 25, 1948, saw a bit of excitement in Caracas as college students rang the university bell in protest against the new government They were silenced by gunfire from a tank. It is said they shot in the air to frighten the students. Not only did it frighten the students, but everyone else</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">as well. One man dropped flat on the street with his new suit and stayed there for ten 'minutes while his countrymen were running in many directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Wild rumors spread (they proved to be just rumors) that oil wells in Maracaibo were blown up, that the army in Valencia and the air force were against the army in Caracas. Soon army plapes droned overhead, necks craned upward wondering what was going to happen. Instead of bombs the planes dropped leaflets reassuring the people that the army was in unity with itself and so therefore the citizens should co-operate with the new government of the junta for the safety and well-being of all. The radio and newspapers now under the control of the new leaders assured the people that they are not dictators, but that they had to act thus in order to protect the rights of the people from a group who were exploiting them. Ex-President Gallegos has been .exiled to Cuba, and Romulo Betancourt, the president of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Action Democratica</span><span class="font14"> party, has retreated to the Colombian embassy. The military junta has dissolved congress and state legislature while placing all their documents in the hands of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">foreign</span><span class="font14"> minister and state executives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Lieut. Col. Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, president of the new military junta governing Venezuela, declared on Thursday ' night, the 26th, that the army would arrange for democratic elections as soon as possibly and that the military leaders do </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">not intend to remain in the government</span><span class="font14"> after the new elections. He stated that the elections would provide for a new congress and a new president. In answer to the question -whether he considered the previous elections had not been fair, he asked reporters to refer to the manifesto issued on Wednesday night. The inference was that the army considers </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Action Democratica</span><span class="font14"> to have used its powers in the government to further its own ends. The junta president said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We want categorically to state that this movement is in no way intended to install a military dictatorship. The Army, as an institution at the service of the nation, and not any group, has no political ambitions- When the army had to do what it did it was not in order to act against democratic principles, but on the contrary: to save those principles which are the fundamental object of all Venezuelans, and to prepare as soon as possible elections at which the Venezuelan people can choose the government they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Delgado Chalbaud, asked to explain the situation which led to the crisis, said it was a question of the inability of the government to resolve the growing crisis. He added that the situation became so critical that the army was faced with isolated revolts if it had not acted. He added that no action was being taken against any political party, but certain leaders of .Aceidn </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Democrdtica</span><span class="font14"> had been placed under arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Many of the new ministers and state governors that have been appointed by the junta are those that were ruling in the days of Ex-Presidents Eliasar Lopez Contreras and Isaias Medina Angarita; so many of the people are wondering if this is a new government after all. Only time will tell whether this regime will help or hinder progress of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Compared with revolutions in other countries in Latin America, the one in Venezuela was mild, outside of the six-o’clock curfew for nine days, which irked the business people very much, especially the theaters. Otherwise life went on as usual. The natives blinked their eyes, shrugged their shoulders and went on about their daily tasks. Some wondered if the new government would do what the others promised to do, that is, give them water in their homes, pave the streets, and bring down the impossible high cost of living. Others wonder how long the new government will last, as the defeated ones are still smarting under what to them was a dictatorial usurping of their democratic rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The revolt here is just another wave in the sea of distressed nations. They are all perplexed, afraid, and know not which way to turn. The more puny man ridicules the word of God and vainly tries to rule his fellow man, the more he proves the truth of the Great Prophet, Jesus Christ, “And there shall be . . . distress of nations, . . . the sea and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coining on the earth?* The so-called “new government” here in Venezuela is like the “new look”; when investigated it proves to he a rehash of the old. This too proves the Bible truth that “there is nothing new under the sun”. The only really new thing that long-suffering humanity can hope for and believe in is the long-promised New World of Righteousness under Christ. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">—Awake!</span><span class="font14"> correspondent in Venezuela.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">D</span><span class="font14">URING the week-end of November 21 and the week preceding it, Belgium was the scene of many and varied manifestations, particularly in the districts of Brussels and Mons. Coinciding as they did with the resignation of the Government it was not difficult to connect the two events. What could be th^ cause of such great indignation which could provoke the fall of a government!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This government under the leadership of Paul Spaak, of international fame, had been in office since February, 1946, following the general elections of the 17th of that month, and was a coalition of the two most popular parties, the PSB and the PSC (the Belgian Socialist Party and the Christian Socialist Party, new names for the former Socialist and Catholic parties). As in every country the government's problems and difficulties were numerous and overwhelming, among them being the increasing unemployment, the -slowing-down in business and industry, overwhelming fiscal laws, the question of subsidies to free (nonstate) schools and indemnities to war casualties and bombed-out people, and, of course, the thorny and ever-pending royal question. But none of these problems was the one that precipitated the crisis and proved to be the undoing of the government.</span></p>

In this matter, so vital to the masses, the government has, in their eyes, fallen very short, and for some time it has been evident that a growing discontent was manifesting itself.

<p><span class="font14">max, and came to a head in the two cases which have been directly responsible for the recent crisis. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">NouveUe Gazette </span><span class="font14">of November 20 says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The ‘repression' is incontestably the most dangerous thing that the last invasion has left behind it in our country. Atrocious sufferings and horrible killings have accumulated deep hatreds, forever insatiable. Too much has already been done in the effort toward appeasement, for almost every day one hears tell of the fate of ex-co-citizens who were specially detested, and one is shocked to learn that they have found a lucrative employment in some more or less distant city. One is incensed to see that one after another the most abominable killers have succeeded in saving their heads. One is forced to the conclusion that there exists in favor of traitors a vast movement of protection and defense that must be uncovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The monthly magazine </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Pygmalion</span><span class="font14"> of as far back as January, 1948, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The death sentence! Our present mode of life is averse to executions. We are, however, up against particularly odious cringes which took place in time of war, crimes which have so often been the cause of the death of our fellow-citizens under atrocious sufferings, by the effect of the most vile of acts—denunciation to the enemy. In such a serious case, and taking into consideration the circumstances of war, pity is inadmissible, blood calls for blood. It is only just that those who have Belgian blood on their hands should be executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jacques Ben Ruben in his treatise on the 'purging* called </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Derriere les Bancs (La trahison vue par le Public)</span><span class="font14"> “Behind the Benches (Treason Seen by the Public)&quot; published in 1945, on page 73 said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Public opinion is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">rightly</span><span class="font12"> uncompromising concerning the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">integral</span><span class="font12"> execution of sentences passed on traitors and collaborators with the enemy. It is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">indispensable</span><span class="font12"> to the moral and social uplift of our country that the punishment for crimes of treason should not be attenuated either now or in the future by any eompiutation, any alleviation or any amnesty. It is not merely a popular desire but an exigency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is not surprising, then, that when the minister of justice, Paul Struye, accorded a pardon to two traitors, proNazis of the Borinage (district of Mons) who were condemned to death, popular feeling ran high and protestations and manifestations were so numerous that a governmental crisis was precipitated. Mr. Struye was at great pains to justify his action, saying that he had already signed enough death sentences to give him the right to pause and look back before going on, and Mr. Spaak added for him, “It is less serious to pardon a guilty man than to send to his death a man for whom there is even the beginning of a reason for pardon/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But as Jacques Ben Ruben further says on page 73 of the above-quoted treatise: “If the people do not always know exactly what they want, on the other hand they know perfectly well what they do not want! And the people do </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font14"> want to hear about any pardons accorded to social traitors/* That is why the gesture of clemency of Mr. Struye roused such a storm of indignation and protest that the cohesion of the government was completely undermined. His gesture was comparable to that of a man throwing a lighted match into a barrel of gunpowder, for in the district where these two criminals lived, and worked for the enemy, the state of mind of the people was certainly not ripe for the beginning of the putting into operation of a policy tending toward general appeasement and the abolition of the death sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The people cannot </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">forget that those </span><span class="font14">two individuals have particularly heavy crimes on their consciences. They have not killed with their own hands, it </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">}s</span><span class="font14"> truo, but by their denunciations and machinations they provided the victims for the killers and but for their intervention about fifty families would not now be mourning their dead., Indeed, Surin<sub>?</sub> the other pardoned man, has been convicted of 36 denunciations, 23 of which resulted in death or incurability for the victims. Even one of the judges of the tribunal of Mons sent in his resignation when the pardons were announced, having himself been doomed to be murdered by order of one of the two, and only escaping by a miracle.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Forming a New Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">And so the will of the people was imposed on the government which had to resign, and Mr, Spaak, who was the first to be asked Io undertake the task of forming a new government, worked strenuously to do so </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">in the</span><span class="font14"> minimum of time. But although there is now one less ministry to fill (the Ministry of Food, for from the end of December there was no more rationing in Belgium), yet the great and seemingly insurmountable difficulty was at first that of finding </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a new </span><span class="font14">minister of justice, one able to satisfy all parties and all elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Air, Spaak eventually owned himself beaten and incapable of forming a government and Mr. Eyskens of the Catholic party and former minister of finance was called upon to attempt the task wherein his colleague had failed. Negotiations were long and laborious; as soon as one point was cleared up another came up for consideration, and became a stumblingblock. The original difficulty was now almost completely lost sight of in the tangle of other matters which had developed. Another two days went by, and Mr. Eyskens gave up and Mr. Spaak took over again. This time, however, it was with much more optimism that he did so, for, thanks to the work accomplished by Mr. Eyskens and what he had been able to do in the way of eliminating certain of the difficulties, Mr. Spaak was confident of being able to form a new government before the day was out. His hopes proved to be well-founded, for he soon announced a new government that included 8 Christian Socialists, 7 Socialists and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font14"> Technicians. This means that there are two ministerial portfolios less than formerly and in this also Mr. Spaak has responded to a desire of public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The new government, it seems, will try to put on one side all questions that are specifically political and deal only with the most, essential problems, leaving out those that would be likely to create a breach between the two parties of the coalition. In this its aim is to continue in power until about the autumn of 1949, a time that would be more appropriate for the holding of general elections. Neither of the two parties is desirous of general elections just now, for to hold a general election now on the present legal basis would only risk provoking another one after July 21, at which date * the legislation concerning woman suffrage comes into force. This would mean that 1949 would be a year of electoral agitation from beginning to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So the royal question and that of school subsidies will remain in abeyance, while economic and financial questions will be given the most prominence, especially those to which the increased unemployment gives rise. The minister of finance (again Mr. Eyskens) will control also expenditure, an item that was formerly dependent on the Budget, It is generally hoped that, instead of putting more and more pressure on the taxpayer, a policy which is a source of mudn dangerous discontent in the country, he will use the other lever that is now available to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The unemployment question is urgent, for it specially affects the port of Antwerp and all the Flemish parts of the country and the textile and shoe-manufacturing industries- It will be dependent on several departments, all of which will have to put forth great efforts to combat it Naturally the international situation affects it tno, and so a minister has been appointed to co-ordinate all efforts in a united effective action against this social evil which always has such serious consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Marshall Plan Administration will be attached to the Ministry of Foreign Commerce, although each ministry that it affects will be responsible for those points interesting it. A new minister of justice has been found, Moreau de Melen of the PSC, born at Liege on August 20, 1902. He is a senator and an attorney at the Court of Appeal of Liege. His problem will be that of examining the question of the ‘repression'and establishing strict criteria in the matter of the leniency policy which was the immediate cause of the crisis just ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And so, once again Belgium is optimistic and hoping great things from its new government. But all those whose eyes are open not onlj<sup>T</sup> to the many internal problems, but to the innumerable international ones, are not deluded by the promises and plans of the government. Thousands of the people of this land desire justice, peace and prosperity under a righteous government, but despair of ever finding these things. Happy are those who possess a sure knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes to make wars to cease, to satisfy the desire of every creature counted worthy to have life, and to establish and administer true justice even to the ends of the earth. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">—Awake!</span><span class="font14"> correspondent in Belgium.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Nobel Prizes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Scientific eyes turn to Sweden in the fall of each year. There the famous Nobel prizes are then being distributed. The fortune left by Alfred Nobel was about thirty-two million kronor, a huge sum for a Swede in those days. The annual interest is divided into five equal pa/ts for distribution to those persons who during the past year had made (1) the most important discovery or invention in physical science, (2) the most important discovery or improvement in chemistry, (3) the most important discovery in physiology or medicine, (4) the best work in literature of an idealistic kind, and (5) (5) the greatest contribution toward brotherhood of man or reduction of armaments and armies or spreading of peace conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Before his will was published Alfred Nobel was not known outside the special circles of business and industrial research where he carried on his work. He hated publicity. Asked for some biographical data about himself, he is reported to have responded: “Why trouble the public with such data? No one wants to read write-ups about people except about actors and murderers, especially the latter, and that whether they have performed their deeds on battlefields or indoors, in a manner that makes people look with bulging eyes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He abhorred creature-worship, and once wrote; “I am, by nature, much less inclined to honor the dead who perceive nothing and must be wholly indifferent to our marble monuments in their honor, than to help the living who are suffering.” He regarded large hereditary fortunes as misfortunes, because of their paralyzing effect on- the energy of those that receive them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nobel himself did work and earned a large fortune. He was born in 1833. At the age of nine he moved with bis family to St. Petersburg, Russia, where his father started works for manufacturing mines for the navy. He was educated as a chemist and engineer and for some time worked with the famous Swede, John Ericson, in America. Later he studied the manufacture of explosives, and after his return to Sweden started works there, as well as in many other places scattered over several countries, in order to exploit his discoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His most remarkable inventions, and those that brought him the highest returns, were the dynamite, that is, nitroglycerine in solid form, the detonating cap, and smokeless powder, the so-called Nobel powder. Being himself a pacifist, he thought that his inventions would help toward abolishing war, because, as he stated, “When two armies will be able to annihilate each other in one second all civilized nations must recoil at the thought of war and sack their armies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By his friends Nobel was called a “world citizen” and, because of his extensive traveling, “the most wealthy tramp in Europe.” He gave alms generously and helped people in other ways while he lived, and by his will made provision for the five annual prizes after his death. The prize winner in each branch or field of endeavor should be “the one who has done the greatest service to humanity, and regardless of nationality”. The prizes were awarded for the first time in 1901, and are now yearly given on December 10, the anniversary of Nobels death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nowadays the ceremonies of presentation are generally broadcast to all parts of the civilized world, and in 1948 were relayed by the All India Radio. After the presentations the prize winners are supposed to deliver discourses on their respective achievements. In this hot-warring or cold-warring world, the most difficult task relative to the Nobel prizes is to select a winner for the peace prize. According to the legacy, it should go to “the person who during the past year has done most toward promoting the brotherhood of nations and abolishing or reducing of standing armies, as well as formation and spreading of peace conferences”. Who was the outstanding champion for peace in the worldly ranks during 1948? The deciding committee could find none worthy of the prize. Hence there was no award of the Nobel peace prize for 1948.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> correspondent in Sweden.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism or Immersion</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">S</span><span class="font14">OME months ago one of our readers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, volunteered some criticisms of the article that appeared in these columns entitled “Are You a Kingdom Heir!” In that article we quoted the translation of the noted English Bible scholar, Jos. B. Rotherham, at Acts 8:4-17 and 19:1-6, where he translates the Greek word </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">baptidzo</span><span class="font14"> as “immerse” instead of ''baptize”, and we proceeded ourselves to use the word “immerse” with reference to believers in Christ Jesus. But our anonymous critic, in all honesty, commented: “'Immersed/ according to any dictionary ^deeply plunged into anything, especially a fluid—dip, plunge or sink into anything/ You can he baptized by immersion but immersion is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font14"> baptism. You can be baptized by immersion, sprinkling, pouring, if done in the name of the Trinity, but please do not corrupt Scripture by calling </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">immersion</span><span class="font14"> baptism. You can </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">immerse</span><span class="font14"> a dog but it is not baptized. I could enjoy your literature if you did not corrupt to suit yourself. Some of your articles are beautiful/’'<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We do not know the religious affiliation of our critic, but here we should like to quote from “Catholic Ready Reference” as appearing in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The National Catholic Almanac</span><span class="font14"> for 1948. On page 239, second column, it says: </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Immersion</span><span class="font14">—A mode of baptism in which the subject is completely immersed in the water by the one baptizing. This mode though valid is no longer in use in the Latin Church/</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In confirmation of this quotation we add that in the third century special fonts for baptismal purposes were built outside the church building. They consisted of a private room which connected with an outside porch, the latter being open to the public, in whose presence the baptismal vows wore taken, after which the subject was baptized in the font privately. The officiating clergyman exorcised the candidate, to cast out devils, blowing in his face three puffs of breath, as representing the so-called “trinity”, the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit. The water in which the baptism took place was consecrated by an elaborate formula, constituting it sacred water, a part of the formula being exorcism or casting out of evil spirits from the water. The candidate was stripped of clothing, as representing the complete putting off of the ‘ old man”, and was baptized three times, once in the name of the Father, once in the name of the Son, and once in the name of the holy spirit. All this was done outside the church building, to intimate that the candidate was not yet a member of the church and could not be a member of it until, by this procedure, he was inducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We agree with our critic that no one would go through such a procedure as the above ritual in order to 'baptize a dog', but, for all that, an immersion of a dog in water is a baptism of such dog. You see, the ancient Greeks would use the same word </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">baptidzo</span><span class="font14"> with reference to the dog as they would respecting a Christian believer who submitted to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">baptisma.</span><span class="font14"> That this is so we refer to the “Vocabulary of the Greek Testament” Part II, by Moulton and Milligan, 1915 edition. On page 102, under the key</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Word &quot;baptidzo” it quotes ancient papyri to show how the speakers of &quot;New Testament’ Greek used this word, and there it shows that the Greeks spoke of a “baptized boat'’ and of not wanting to be &quot;baptized” when taking, a trip in a large ship. From this it is plain that this Greek word &quot;baptidzo” means to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">submerge,</span><span class="font14"> as this Moulton-Milligan Dictionary translates the word, and it is proper to use the word &quot;baptize” with reference to all things submerged, whether a dog, a ship, or a Christian believer who is dipped in water to symbolize his consecration of himself to God through Jesus Christ. The fact that the inspired writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures used this word &quot;baptidzo” is significant; it proves that pouring or sprinkling water upon a person is not a Christian baptism, for it is not a submerging or immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">No infant could possibly be in the condition of mind or heart that would enable it to consecrate itself intelligently to God according to the Holy Scriptures, so as to become dead to selfish self and to the world. That consecration is the true, inward baptism or immersion; what is done with water is merely the symbolic outward baptism or immersion. Furthermore, the symbolical baptism with water could not have any real meaning and be performed prior to the real inward baptism, no, not with any validity in God's sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since these things are true, it follows that the greater number of professing Christians have never had the true symbolical baptism, water baptism, since they could receive it only after intelligently making a vow of consecration to God through Christ The baptizing or immersing of adults prior to consecration would be no more efficacious than an ordinary bath, no more of a symbolic baptism than the sprinkling of an unconsecrated infant. It behooves all professing Christians, therefore, to inquire earnestly which is the true water baptism, the true symbol, and what it symbolizes, and to obey it now before the battle of Armageddon. And every consecrated person, &quot;dead indeed” to selfwill and worldly attitudes, will be on the alert to know and to do the will of God in this matter as well as in every other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Let us imagine that the confusion on this subject of baptism or immersion in water were so complete, and that the testimony on the procedure of the early church were so confused, that we had nothing today whatever to guide us in determining whether the apostolic way of water baptism was by sprinkling or pouring or immersing. Yet we are now in a place where, seeing clearly what the real baptism actually is, it is possible for us to discern clearly what would' and what would not constitute the symbol or picture of it. Scrutinizing every form of so-called “baptism”, only one faithfully pictures death and burial with Christ. Where is there any symbol of being dead to the world and to self in many or a few drops of water dabbed or sprinkled upon the forehead, or in a pailful of water poured over one’s person? If there is any symbolical likeness to death and burial in either of these forms </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> is unable to discern it. But when we come to consider immersion we see at a glance a wonderful illustration, a striking, remarkable, fitting illustration of all that is implied in the real baptism of consecrating oneself to God through Christ, to be henceforth dead to self and world and alive only to God and his Kingdom service. Not only does theGreek word </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">baptidzo</span><span class="font14"> signify submergence, dipping, burying, overwhelming, but the whole procedure connected with immersing the candidate backward into the water in the name of the Father and His Son and His holy spirit is a most striking picture of a burial of the dead. And as the administrator of the water baptism raises the candidate out of the water and to his feet, it pictures just what God has promised us, to raise us up to life through Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conference of Spanish Archbishops on Protestant Propaganda in Our Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A Statement of Principles for the Faithful</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Instruction published by the &quot;Official Bulletin” of the Archbishopric of Toledo</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Toledo, 18.—The cardinal archbishop of Toledo has made known the Conference of Spanish Archbishops’ instruction on Protestant propaganda in Spain in the Archbishopric’s “Official Bulletin”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Since the bishops’ main duty,” said the instruction, “is to guard the preservation and purity of the faith, the Conference of Spanish Archbishops found it necessary in their last meeting to consider the recent campaign of Protestant propaganda being carried on in Spain, agreeing to set forth for His Excellency the Head of the State a faithful and respectful exposition of the facts in relation to the legislation now in force in our country, and to publish a statement of principles for the faithful as soon as the 'nihil obstat’ was received from the Holy See on the resolutions of the Conference. Some of the prelates have already done this in a very noteworthy manner in their own dioceses, where the abovementioned campaign has been particularly intense- But the Conference of Spanish Archbishops felt that it too should do so, addressing itself to all the faithful Spaniards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The question of freedom and tolerance of religion is not merely a political question but one concerning dogmatics and public ecclesiastical law, determined by the pontifical encyclicals, whose concrete application in each nation or state depends on the conditions existing therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“His Holiness Leo XIII, with all the authority of the Supreme Magisterium of the Church and with all the prestige and wisdom and prudence which has crowned the pontificate with glory, dedicated his immortal encyclical ‘Libertas’ to the setting forth of the excellencies of freedom, its use and true conception, but refuting and condemning, at the same time, the errors concerning freedom, outstanding among which arc freedom of religion in individuals and freedom of religion in the state. Freedom of religion in individuals is false when taken to mean that it is entirely in the hands of each one to profess whatever religion suits him or not to profess any.” The instruction explains this encyclical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The condition in Spain, whether viewed from official statistics or the way of life, is that of Catholic unity. Those Spaniards not professing the Catholic faith, and above all who are officially joined to some religion other than the Catholic, are such an insignificant number that they cannot be taken into consideration by a law that looks out for the social community. If in Article 6 of the Statute Laws of Spain there was introduced an element of tolerance toward dissenting religions, it was to care for foreigners living in Spain, among whom are some who come from countries where there is a Protestant majority or numerous non catholic minorities. But in accordance with the principles established by His Holiness Leo XIII, tolerance was reduced in Spain to the limits to which it should be reduced, after the Spanish government had first discussed the matter with the Holy See as obliged to do by Article 10 of the agreement of June 7, 1941, i.e., to private religion without outward or publie manifestation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It analyzes the extent of the above mentioned Article 6 of the Statute Laws of Spain, which states plainly that what is authorized or tolerated is the private practice of noncatholic religions, but that no ceremony or outward manifestation will be allowed except those of the Catholic religion. &quot;What we Spanish archbishops request, and it is our duty to do so, is that what is established in this fundamental law of the statutes of Spain be observed, after discussing this delicate problem ■with the Holy See.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since this instruction is addressed to faithful Spaniards, we exhort them, in fulfillment of our pastoral duty, to preserve the Catholic faith in all its integrity; it is'Christ’s doctrine, and its most faithful custodian is the Holy Roman Church, the only one showing the characteristic signs of the true church, unity, holiness, catholicity and apostolicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are sure that the Catholic masses in Spain will never change to any of the Protestant faiths which they rightly consider heretical. But that does not mean that a public campaign of Protestant proselytism and of attacks against Catholic dogmas will not cause injury to some unwary ones; and it should be avoided, not by acts of violence but by denouncing the abuses and demanding that the provisions of the fundamental law of the state to be carried out strictly, after discussing it with the Holy See.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The dogmatic refusal to compromise is the defense of the revealed truth and is essential to Catholicism as an echo of Christ’s words: “He that is not with me is against me.” But let no one think that this uncompromising attitude of the faith is incompatible with serenity, understanding, meekness and true charity, such as Christ teaches us to practice, even toward our enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Disappointment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Or Well-placed Trust?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To rely upon men to cure world ills is to meet with repeated disappointment. World rulers in general have turned their backs on truth and righteousness. Futility plagues the few who seek to give some help. Truly then the Scripture says, “Bely not upon great men—mere mortals who can give no help/ (Psalm 146: 3, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font14"> But if even “great men” cannot be relied upon, to whom can we look? Do you sincerely seek the answer to that question? If so, you should read the 320-page book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font14"> which gives a satisfying and reliable answer.
