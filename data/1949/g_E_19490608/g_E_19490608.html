</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">MONOPOLY is defined by U. S. Attorney General Tom Clark as “a tool of totalitarianism which handcuffs the individual and enchains democracy”. To put </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font9"> more </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">precisely,</span><span class="font9"> a monopoly is a conniving together of forces bent on seizing control of what belongs to all. Monopolies not only squeeze a country dry of economic wealth. They intertwine their relentless tentacles around national and international politics. Whether they be concentrations of religious, political or economic power, monopolies betray no sign of scruple, no pain of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The American government, although it is the most powerful political force in the world, is not mighty enough to cope with the Big Business systems that relentlessly merge into the gigantic concentrations of economic power called monopolies. It costs American taxpayers $200,-000 to fight the average anti-trust case. Little or no permanent good is accomplished ; where one leg of the octopus is chopped off, two seem to grow back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Consequently the United States, thanks to its “free enterprise” system, is a paradise for monopolies. There are insurance monopolies, steel monopolies, automobile monopolies, movie monopolies, labor monopolies; there are monopolies in the food, chemical, timber, communications, transportation fields; an endless chain of money-bloated monopolies encircle every market, heaping together treasures to rust and cry out against them ip these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But how does a monopoly get started! How is it formed! How does it grew! How does it seize control of a government! How does it ascend to* the dizzy </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">heights from which it arrogantly dominates</span><span class="font9"> a world market! The birth and career of a monopoly was unfolded in dramatic, unbelievable detail by a Senatorial investigation of the oil trust known as ARAMCO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An abbreviation for the Arabian American Oil Co., ARAMCO is a Delaware corporation originally formed on a fifty-fifty basis by the Texaco Company and Standard Oil of California. In March, 1947, Standard of New Jersey and^ Socony-Vacuum entered into the partnership for reasons hereinafter outlined. Within 18 years from the time of its conception, the ARAMCO corporation acquired 250,000 square miles of oil concessions in Saudi Arabia—ah area equal in size to the states of California and Oregon combined. It wheedled and bulldozed the United States government into spending 99 million irredeemable dollars of taxpayer's money to protect these concessions, first from Nazi and now from Communist encroachments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And while </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">evading</span><span class="font9"> the payment of &quot;income taxes it broke its promises to repay its own government for protection in petroleum products at fair cost; at the height of World War II it flagrantly lied to overcharge the U. S. Navy more than $38,000,000 for petroleum while selling to other countries—including enemy Japan—at reduced prices. You may be sure that throughout its brazen career no one hollered louder for protection, no one waved a flag that was .redder, whiter, bluer, than ARAM CO’S. Into the postwar era ARAM CO swaggers, arrogant, defiant, holding $10,000,000,000 worth of concessions in the world’s richest known oil reserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here is how ARAMCO built its empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ibn Saud and Lend Lease</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, absolute monarch of Saudi Arabia, had, up to World War II, maintained his national budget off revenues from the annual Moslem pilgrimages to‘the holy cities of Mecca and Medina which are located inside his domain. When the war broke out, no longer could Mohammed’s worshipers trek to Mecca and Medina, and Ibn Saud’s national revenue dried up. His government shook and tottered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wily old Ibn Saud knew well the danger of calling on foreign powers for help; they always demanded their pound of flesh in return. As for Arabia’s fabulous oil deposits, there was no such thing as the technical know-how among his 6,000,000 illiterate Bedouins; nor was Ibn Saud financially able to develop an oil industry if he had bad the technical brains available. But there were plenty of foreign powers lusting for Arabian oil. The British, the French, the Italians, the Japanese, the Dutch, all just as eager to<sup>1</sup> monopolize on Arabian oil as they had on Iranian and Turkish oil to the north of him. These powers, however, represented foreign governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There was one other bidder for Ibn Saud’s oiL That was American Free Enterprise. These men were independent businessmen. They were dominated by no government. They would not be meddling in Ibn Saud s domestic policies. All they wanted was oil, “black gold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1933 Ibn Saud leased the first concessions to the American oil companies. He soon demanded oil royalties, even ir advance. By 1941 ARAMCO had advanced the king $6,800,000, Thereafter he demanded an additional sis million dollars in advance royalties </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By the time Nazi General Rommel was rai sing a fury in North Africa, ARAMCO had sunk about $27,500,000 in Arabian oil developments; and who knew but that the Nazis might take over the Middle East? The big boys in oil did not want to invest any more of their own money in this risky venture, still they did not want to abandon the venture—provided it was somebody else that furnished Ibn Saud his $6,000,000 a year. To quote the report of the Senatorial investigation of the Middle East oil situation (Report No. 440, Part 5, page 3): “The company took the position not expressed to the king that the international situation </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">did not justify</span><span class="font9"> any substantial additional investment of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">their own capital&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Italics are added to that quotation to accentuate this question: If investment of their own capital was not justifiable, why would the investment of American taxpayers’ money be justifiable? Yet ARAMCO appealed to the United States government to do that very thing. It was determined that Mr, James A. Moffet would submit the proposal to President Roosevelt. He outlined ARAM CO’S needs. If the government would furnish King Ibn Saud $6,000,000 annually for the next five years, ARAMCO would repay the government as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Persian Gulf</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">F.O.B. Ship 1^800,000 bbls, of gasoline at 3|c per gal, 2,660,000 bbls, of Diesel oil at 75e per bbl. 3,400,000 bbls, fuel oil at 40e per bbl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That would figure out at $6,000,000 worth of petroleum products annually for the next five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In spite of this flattering offer, it appears that the oil boys ran into one of those perennial nuisances called a legal snag. The U. S. government could not hand out money to a country unless thet country was important to the national defense of the United States, and it was fairly impossible even for a diplomat to imagine why Saudi Arabia was important in 1941 to the national defense of the United States. Saudi Arabia was not eligible for Lend-Lease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">So Moffett</span><span class="font9"> did </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not stop</span><span class="font9"> with the president. He broached the matter to the secretary of state, Cordell Hull, and the secretary of the navy, Frank Knox. In May, 1941, Moffett, together with W. S. S. Rodgers, president of the Texas Corporation, approached Jesse H. Jones, secretary of commerce and federal loan administrator. Then they went back to the White House and talked further with Stephen Early and Harry L. Hopkins, aides to the president. Still, wheedling, coaxing and gold-plated promises just could not transform Saudi Arabia into a Lend-Lease eligible. Could not the oil companies go ahead and advance Ibn Saud the money?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ibn Saud, sensing that he was milking the wrong cow, finally decided that he would have to go ahead and apply directly to the U. S. government for aid on some other grounds. ARAMCO’s official, fearing to have a U. S. foreign minister make personal contact with Ibn Saud, pulled strings in the Department </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of State and the meeting never came</span><span class="font9"> off. Meanwhile federal loan administrator Jesse Jones and other high-ranking officials in Washington talked with British foreign minister Lord Halifax and others, and King Ibn Saud got his money, it being channeled indirectly from America through the British, and ARAMCO taking care to get credit for having swung the deal. To quote the Senatorial report: “The United States Government effectively arranged for aid to the king of Saudi Arabia indirectly through the British, which ultimately cost the United States the sum of $51,060,000?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In return for this free-handed financing, remember, ARAMCO, through Mr. Moffett, made its own proposition, on its own terms, to sell fuel oil to the U. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Government at 40c a barrel; Diesel oil at 75c a barrel; and gasoline at 3|e a gallon. When the time came for ARAM<sup>1</sup>-CO to fulfill its bargain, in the heat of World War II, when the nation and its allies were in sore need of petroleum products, this, in the words of the Senatorial report, is what happened:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The negotiations [had not been] conducted on a formal basis by either the oil companies or the United States Government. Good faith was implicit in their dealings. The Government had every right to expect the oil companies to honor their moral, if not'their legal, obligation and to supply oil at the prices fixed in their proposals. In fact, substantially everything the companies asked the United States government to do was done .by their own admission. The performance differed only in method. The results sought by the oil companies were accomplished. Despite this fact the oil companies did not fulfill their part— furnishing oil at 40c a barrel. They received all </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the benefits</span><span class="font9"> and in return ignored their promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Santa Claus Rebuffed</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then things took a new twist. Britain, meeting the financial needs of King Ibn Saud during 1941 and 1942, with money supplied by the United States, began </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to assume a</span><span class="font9"> position of over importance in Saudi Arabia. Britain was on the way to becoming intrenched as the financial adviser and backer of the Saudi Arabian government. That ARAMCO could not stand for. No government interference, neither American nor much less British, was going to be tolerated. All that governments had any business meddling with was the matter of putting up the money, and the cannon fodder if necessary, to support the oil monopoly which would not keep its bargain with the government that supported it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hitting the warpath, W. S. S. Rodgers, seconded by a chairman of Standard Oil, H. D. Collier, lined up everybody that was anybody in Washington—Secretaries Harold L. Ickes (Interior), Knox and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Forrestal (Navy), Henry L. Stimson (War)j Sumner Welles (undersecretary of state) and others, in one all-out blitz to snap the red tape and have Saudi Arabia declared eligible for direct American lend-lease. The conferences began in the office of Secretary of Interior Ickes on February 5,1943. Thirteen days later this directive was issued by President Roosevelt to the Lend-Lease administrator: “To enable you to arrange for lend-lease aid to the government of Saudi Arabia I hereby find that the defense of Saudi Arabia is vital to the defense of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So the role of Britain as Santa Claus to King Ibn Saud was squelched. The United States government was now the servile lackey of the oil companies to manipulate as they pleased. Mr. Rodgers, ironically, made fresh promises to sell oil to Uncle Sam “at prices well under world prices”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Washington Lackeys Rebuffed in Turn</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was at this point that developments took still another twist, a comical twist. The political lackeys in Washington seemed to get some odd notions of their own. Some bright boy recalled that back in 1913 British prime minister Winston Churchill had bought control for the British government of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. that was now successfully monopolizing the oil of Iran and other sections of the Middle East. Uncle.Sam was underwriting the Arabian government, to the tune of millions. Why should not Uncle follow the British precedent? Why not invest in some ARAM CO stock? After confabbing between themselves* Knox, Ickes, Jesse Jones, James F. Brynes and other State Department heads formulated a Petroleum Reserve Corporation and Ickes was delegated to negotiate for “stock control of the company (ARAMCO) in the interests of national defense and the economic needs of the nation”. The unceremonious way Mr, Ickes got set back on his heels is what gave things a comical twist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Ickes testified that when he proposed that the oil companies sell the government ARAMCO stock, first the Standard Oil Co. of California went through the motions of agreeing to terms, then the Texas Co. would buck; they would then reverse the clowning—Texas Co. would agree and Standard would buck. “Bommel had been chased out of North Africa and they felt secure in their concession, and more disposed to thumb their nose at us,” crabbed Mr. Ickes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By 1943 the American government had, by financial jugglings, underwritten British aid to Saudi Arabia to the tune of $40,000,000, all of which was granted with no provision for repayment of either interest or principal. After chalking Saudi Arabia on the Lend-Lease list in February, 1943, the United States dived into a joint program with the British to “maintain political and economic stability in Saudi Arabia”, regardless of costs. By 1947 total assistance to Saudi Arabia, none of which is guaranteed recoverable, soared to $99,500,000. Among the. gifts was included a $3,500,000 airport at Dhahran of which “ARAMCO is the principal beneficiary”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Farce of Navy Oil Purchases</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Against this background secured by $99,500,000 of government spending, now behold ARAMCO’s dealings with the U. S. Navy when the time came in July 1945 for the oil companies to show their gratitude. At that time France was desperately in need of oil. The United States was furnishing oil to France via lend-lease. The Navy was appointed to purchase oil from ARAMCO for France. What about those agreements by Messrs. Moffett and Rodgers to sell petroleum to the government at 40c a barrel! The government's copies had been lost somewhere in the labyrinth of officialdom at Washington and never reached the Navy department when time came to close a deal, ARAMCO, you may be sure, did not oblige by digging up its own copies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The price that ARAMCO quoted the Navy was more than double the original prices—$1.05 a barrel. Navy's investigator MacKrille found that under no circumstances was a price higher than 84c justifiable. ARAMCO haggled for five weeks. Among other arguments it came up with the outright lie that King Ibn Saud had doubled his royalties from 21c to 42c a barrel. Navy ultimately paid $1,05. ARAMCO was selling the same oil to Japan for 86c and Tor as little as 70c a barrel. France, for whom the U. S. was buying the oil at $1.05j was at the same time buying the same oil from ARAMCO at 90c and 95c a barrel. In December 1946 ARAMCO upped its prices to the IT. S. Navy for UNRR A consignments, quoting the U. S. $1.23 and at the same time selling to Uruguay for $1 per barrel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From January 1,1942, through June 30, 1947, the U. S. government paid ARAMCO $38,505,578.11 in excess of the amount it would have paid had the purchases been made on the basis of the original Moffett agreement. It amounted to such huge excess profits that, believe it or not, even ARAMCO’s officials blushed, and its vice-president James T. Duce rushed a memo to the higher bracket urging that something be done about “allocating all possible charges against 1946 income&quot;, else their “excessively high&quot; net income might put them in an “embarrassing position&quot;. Consequently such an enormous amount of the profits i were channeled away through the two non-taxable Canadian and Bahamian subsidiaries that ARAMCO evaded a payment of $100,000,000 in income tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">OU Men in U.S. Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One reas'on a monopoly like ARAMCO ,could get away with wholesale robbery, then add insult to injury, was the fact that the oil companies had key men planted right inside the U, S, goyern-ment. James Terry Duce, vice-president of ARAMCO since 1940, and formerly associated with its parent company, the Texas Co., for 25 years, was at one time director of the Foreign Division of the Petroleum Administration, D. E. Boden-schatz, assistant manager of the export department of the General Petroleum Products of Los Angeles, a subsidiary of Socony-Vaeuum, was the naval officer who wrote the justification for the purchase of ARAMCO crude oil at $1.05 a barrel. J. J. Walsh, a naval procurement officer who worked on the ARAMCO contracts, later became associated with Standard Oil of New Jersey. Admiral Andrew Carter, recently president of the Overseas Tank Ship Co., a Texas and Socal subsidiary, was formerly the deputy petroleum administrator for war. Max Thornberg, a vice-president of Bahrein Petroleum Co. Ltd., was special assistant to the undersecretary of state. The one man, Ralph K. Davies, who refused to use his connections with the oil moguls to influence government policy, lost his position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As mentioned early in this article, in March, 1947, the world was informed that Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum, both eastern distributors, had bought a 40-percent interest in ARAMCO for the sum of $102,000,000. During the crucial winter of 1947-1948 not a drop of Middle East oil was delivered on the American east coast. Domestic oil shot up in price to $3.27 a barrel. Middle East oil could have .been delivered to the east coast and sold at 100, percent profit for $2.10 a barrel. Only after the government threatened to bring an anti-trust suit against ARAMCO for restraining oil deliveries was the shortage relieved.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Crime did not pay for the young Negro that walked into a jeweler’s shop in a tough section of Brooklyn last January. He had a gun in his pocket and contemplated a work of robbery. The five-foot proprietor reported that the six-foot bandit entered and. extended hie wrist watch to have it repaired, but when the jeweler adjusted his glass to his eye to give the watch an inspection the burglar drew the gun and snapped, “This is a hold-up I” The jeweler grabbed for the gun, failed to get it in his hand but got it on his head, much to his painful surprise. The bandit forced him to a rear room, where the unco-operative jeweler again tried to seise the gun, and in the fight that followed the jeweler was winning till the badman broke loose </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ran. </span><span class="font7">The jeweler gave chase, and tangled with the gunman out on the street. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">man again tore </span><span class="font7">loose and made good his escape this time. But on his way to the hospital </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for treatment of a, </span><span class="font7">scalp wound the jeweler opened his hand ^nd there was the bandit’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">watch.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For a public Institution to pose as a champion of religious tolerance, then in the same breath exalt one religious group and abase another, is hypocritical. For It to stubbornly persist in such intolerance after numerous protests of the victims shows hatred. But the wronged ones rest their case with Jehovah God. In time He will apply His principle to turn the tables; “Exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high,<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font20">D</span><span class="font9">URING January the main public library of New York city exhibited a photographic study entitled “Children in America”. It was divided into two sections, the first portraying what the library’s news release by Anna L. Glantz, administrative assistant, termed “the negative side of life for America’s children&quot;. The second section pictured what was considered favorable conditions and was headed &quot;&quot;Towards a Better Children’s World”. This exhibition of seventy-five photographs was prepared by Hungarian-born Marion Palfi over a period of two and a half years and was financed by the Julius Rosenwald Fund. It foments religious hate. And the New York library by scheduling it for exhibition at its main building and branches for one year also foments religious hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How so? In the unfavorable section were pictured delinquent children in trouble with the law, children in reformatories and heavily barred cells, children loafing in pool rooms and running in street gangs and petting in public places, children neglected, abandoned, undernourished and exploited through child labor abuses. And stuck in the midst of these photos of unfortunates and delinquents is a picture of a young girl on the street displaying to passers-by the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines. She is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the magazines contain printed Bible sermons designed to stem the tide of delinquency. But such Bible educational work the New York library terms “the negative side of life for America’s children&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When a representative of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> protested to a library spokesman he was informed that “the picture is a fact and speaks for itself”. We say the exhibitor has not allowed it to speak for itself, but has surrounded it with other picturevoices that twist the facts. Exhibited alone or in a favorable setting the picture can speak for itself, but not in its present company. For instance, if someone snapped a picture of a Catholic nun on a street corner collecting money, would the library embed that photo in a series of pictures of panhandlers, bums, vagrants and drunks in the Bowery begging for liquor money? Would the library display the snapshot of a Jewish lad taking up a collection on the subway to aid Jews cm the same spot where they stuck the youthful worker of Jehovah’s witnesses? Would they exhibit the picture of a Catholic youth employed as an altar boy in such a setting as they placed the yourig girl engaged in preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom? Would they say those pictures were facts and would speak for themselves' Certainly not! But when it comes to an unpopular religious minority such as Jehovah's witnesses the “brave” library casts them into the category of jailbirds and delinquents as quickly as Daniel was thrown into the lions’ den!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How Hate Is Fomented</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this exhibit the smug library brands an organization in Georgia, the Columbians, as promoting “religious and racial prejudices”. The charge returns </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to the </span><span class="font9">library to roost. It foments prejudice by inferring by association and classification that Jehovah's witnesses are delinquents. In the favorable section, “Towards a Better Children’s World,” it exhibits a Catholic priest surrounded by boys at Boys Town in Nebraska, recommending such Roman Catholic religious organizations as fit tutors for youth. Hence, by putting Jehovah's witnesses in the villain's Tole and the Catholic Church in the hero’s, the library abases one religious group and exalts another, smears one and glorifies the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The contention that such use of facilities in a public building is fomenting religious hate is not far-fetched. Our representative was informed by the library that upward of 10,000 persons went through the library daily. They see the picture of the girl with the magazines, .and conclude that she is being exploited and misled down the road of delinquency. Then they walk on the streets of New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">They see hundreds of</span><span class="font9"> New </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">York </span><span class="font9">children on the streets displaying </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> plus hundreds of adults doing likewise. Their mind goes back to the exhibit they saw in the library, and they associate this Bible educational work and those doing it with the horrible pictures of delinquency and crime. Hate for the organization of Jehovah's witnesses is born. Whether this fomenting of religious hate is the library's purpose is not the vital point,* it is the practical results of the exhibit that jnust be coped with. Many have protested to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> about the library's attack against Jehovah's witnesses; we suggest that they and others who disapprove </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">tof</span><span class="font9"> such assau/c </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font9"> a ptibtfe institution write directly to the New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, New York 18, N, Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Assuming that the library was not fully aware of the effects of this attack on Jehovah's witnesses, an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> representative wrote to Anna L. Glantz of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the Public Relations Office of the library. </span><span class="font9">In addition to high-lighting the above points, the letter suggested that if the library was unprejudiced it would perhaps display an exhibit of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in its proper light, and in this way counteract the false impression previously given. This was no endeavor for free publicity on the part of Jehovah's witnesses; they had been projected into the public eye by the library, so i't should feel no hesitancy to merely change the publicity from false to true. However, the letter's main contention was that the picture of the young Witness should either be placed on the favorable side of the exhibit or removed altogether. The reasons were twofold: it would halt misrepresentation of the work of Jehovah's witnesses as an organization, and it would end the libel against the young girl involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bible</span><span class="font9"> TForA: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Commercial, Says Library</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Despite the fact that the letter very </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">carefully explained that the work the </span><span class="font9">girl was doing was in the nature of Bible education, that it was nob commercial, that she was doing it willingly, uncoerced, unexploited, Administrative-Assistant Glantz replied in honeyed phrase that no reproach was intended against Jehovah's witnesses but that the exhibit only reflected “the regrettable necessity of young children's having to sell newspapers for a living”. The sweet phraseology was further soured by refusal to remove the girl's picture and ignoring the request for presenting the truth in an exhibition. The only step taken was to blot out the names of the two magazines, but since their cover pictures and layouts are the same for every issue and well known the mere hiding of the names did not erase their identity. Moreover, the girl was still being libeled, as our answering letter to Anna Glantz stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is not fair to the girl to leave her picture in with the delinquent and exploited. She is not delinquent. She is engaged in no commercial selling work. She is not exploited. She is preaching the gospel. Her picture is large, recognizable by any who know her. She is being libeled. To bring it home to you, if you were that girl's mother, would you be appeased by the removal of the magazine names, or would you not insist on her picture being deleted from “the negative side of life for America's children” ? The picture should have been removed entirely, or put where it rightly belonged, on the side “Towards a Better Children's World”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But Anna Glantz tenaciously held to her prejudice against the work of Jehovah's witnesses, for in her reply she contended again that it was the “picture of a child' who has to earn some income for her subsistence”. As for the child, because it did not live in New York and because its identity was not given this library official said it was not injured; moreover, “her mother was with her at the time and gave her full consent to Miss Palfi to take the picture?' And no accurate display of the work of Jehovah's witnesses could be made because “the exhibition schedule is filled to 1950”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Library Lies Exposed</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These statements are not truthful. At the end of January the exhibition left the main library for its year-long tour of the branches. The exhibition space thereby vacated in the main library has remained vacant of exhibits to the time of this writing, May 1. That the mother gave consent for the picture is only a sly half-truth. With only the picture to go on, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> was able through the efficient organization of Jehovah's witnesses to trace the girl and her mother. The mother, Mattie Lou Linkhart, of Lake City, Fla., says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A lady came by and took Betty’s picture. I did not refuse because I had no idea that it would be put on public exhibition. Since I have learned that it is used in New York to show the negative side of life for America’s children. I never thought of such a thing! This greatly misrepresents my little girl and the work she engages in. Betty is now twelve years old and is in the seventh grade. She attends Bible studies regularly, and does magazine street witnessing every Saturday for an hour or two, as well as other parts of the service; and not because she is forced for financial reasons but because she knows it is right. She does such work with no other purpose in mind but serving the Lord. I request that this picture be taken from the library before further damage is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If Anna Glantz allowed one who appeared to be only a curious passer-by to. snap her picture, would she consider that permission for the photograph to be enlarged and hung in the rogues’ gallery! That would be analagous to the tactics of Marion Palfi relative to Betty Anne Linkhart, which' Anna Glantz defends. A press write-up on Palfi’s exhibition quotes her as saying: “With the Columbians, I used deception for the only time,” She lost count. She certainly used it with the mother of Betty Anne. The mother's statement refutes the charge of Palfi and Glantz that Betty Anne “has to earn some income for her subsistence”; the child's statement does also. It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am Betty Anne Linkhart, the girl whom they have placed on public exhibition in New York libraries showing the negative side of life for America's children. I would like it removed for the following reasons: It makes the work of Jehovah’s witnesses appear commercial, which is completely false. It makes it appear that my parents are not able to support me. It misrepresents me in the eyes of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the world as one not desired, a delinquent. 1 have </span><span class="font9">been doing the work of Jehovah's </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">wit</span><span class="font9">nesses since I was six or seven years Old, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">do it because I enjoy it; not because paid. I know that it is right, and leads to salvation </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font9">those that do it and also other*. ^Besides working an hour or more on Saturdays in street work I go from house to house with Bible literature, which is in full accordance with the Bible and the laws of the land. Jeho</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">vah's </span><span class="font9">witnesses are doing a good work, and should not be misrepresented. Others would do well by joining with them in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. If each one continues faithful it will mean life eternal in the New . World, which John saw in the vision. [Revelation 21:1-5] I am going to be baptized soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah the Judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the library was informed of the attitude of both Betty Anne and her mother, Richard M. Brett, business manager, speaking for the library, said “the case is without merit” and “we consider the matter closed”, But the case is not closed. Jehovah God is the Judge in cases involving His faithful servants. Though the library tersely closes the case, a Higher Judge may reopen it As Ecclesiastes 5:8 states: “If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regarded ; and there be higher than they.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The work of Jehovah's witnesses is not considered commercial by the Supreme Court of the United States. Neither does the Bible, and Herein may be found many instances where youngsters served God in spite of opposition from oldsters. Samuel, David, Jeremiah, Timothy and others preached,at an early age in the face of powerful opposition. Jesus preached at the age of twelve years, confounding the bewhiskered old religious scribes and Pharisees of His day. Twelve-year-old Betty Anne Linkhart can take comfort in these facts, as well as in the Scripture forecast that Jesus* followers in these “last days” would be “hated of all* nations”.—Matthew 24:9; 5:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus far the New’ York Public Library has proved itself a fomenter of religious hate. Its letters were politely phrased, rich in lip-service to tolerance and religious freedom that costs nothing, but poor in action in harmony therewith. It is responsible for publicizing the religiously prejudiced exhibit by Marion Palfi, who is reportedly contemplating “a photographic dissection of discrimination as it exists in her adopted country”. She has striking source material right at her fingertips—the religious discrimination she has shown in her “Children in America” exhibit. She and the library have joined hands in fomenting religious hate, in abasing Jehovah's witnesses and exalting the Roman Catholic Church. In due time Jehovah God will apply His righteous rule in a dramatic and violent turning of the tables: “Exalt that which is low, and abase that which' is high.” —Ezekiel 21:26; Matthew 23:12, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Sian, Ver.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">G</span><span class="font9">RAVE-FACED he turned the little crank. In a loud voice he recited the simple childish rhyme, &quot;Mary had a lit-tie lamb?' This done, the needle was set back at the starting point, and the little crank again began to turn. The air was tense with silence and expectation. Faintly the oft-repeated words of childhood echoed back from the foil-covered cylinder. Onlookers blinked their eyes in amazement. Even the grave face changed to a huppy smile as Thomas Alva Edison heard his own voice for the first time. An idea had succeeded; Edison’s first &quot;talking machine” worked!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That was back in 1877 in the inventor’s famous Menlo Park laboratory. Since then a whole string of improvements in sound-reproducing machines have been made. Flat records took the place of the cylinders, except on dictaphone machines; shellac-faced laminated discs replaced the clumsy nonbreakable ones of a generation ago; electric-driven turntables did away with spring-wound motors. Automatic record changers, electrical pickup heads, and slow-turning, narrow-grooved records made of nonbreakable plastic have all added refinement to the &quot;canned music&quot; machines. The beautiful console cabinet, an essential part of the modern home's furniture, housing phonograph, radio and television sets, is a far cry from that crude gadget that Edison first assembled more than seventy years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of great importance also was the introduction a few years ago of recorders and reproducers using magnetized wares and tapes in place of the conventional embossed dises. While these machines are strictly a product of this electronic age, the idea of sound-on-wire is not novel. Before Edison’s phonograph, the principle of putting sound on wire was patented, back in 1862, but nothing was done about it, because of lack of technical knowledge. Discovery of the vacuum tube was first necessary. During the recent war rapid progress was made in developing and perfecting wire recording.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In making regular phonograph records the electrical impulses from the microphone are turned into mechanical vibrations that are engraved in a wax disc, which are later transferred by embossing onto plastic discs. In magnetic wire recording, however, the electrical impulses from the &quot;mike” remain electrical and are used to operate an electromagnet through which a spool of thin stainless-steel wire is run at the rate of about two feet per second. A pattern of magnetic impulses is deposited on the wire, and when re-run through a coil of a reproducing machine the magnetized area on the wire creates a magnetic field that sets up a corresponding electrical current. Such method gives practically 100-percent reproduction of the original .music or speech with none of the surface noise so characteristic .of groove-and-needle records. Another interesting thing is that the recording on the wire can, if desired, easily be &quot;erased” simply by passing the wire through a coil having a high-frequency current. Thus demagnetized the wire can be used over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marvels of Magnetic Tape</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font9">this fast-moving age, as modern as wire recording may seem, it- has already been made out-of-date by tape recording. This improvement consists of using a reel of narrow tape in place of a spool of wire, an idea that originated in Germany during the war. The tape is made of a strip of paper, about 14-thousandths of an inch thick, upon which is spread a coating of smooth, mirror-like synthetic resin about ^-thousandth of an inch thick Imbedded in this resin are millions of microscopic grains of magnetite, sometimes called loadstone. As in the case of the wire recorder, when this tape is passed through the magnetic field the molecules of the iron oxide are arranged in magnetic patterns. Likewise, the tape can be demagnetized and used again if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tape recording, though employing the same basic principles, has many advantages over wire recording. For one thing, the cost of tapes is only a fraction of that of wire. Tape is a half or a third as likely to break, is not so likely to get tangled; and after playing can be rewound in one-twelfth the time it takes to rewind wire. Another advantage over wire, tapes can be snipped at any place with the scissors and spliced together again with Scotch tape, thus allowing editing or deleting of sentences, paragraphs or section of a speech or any portion of a musical number, a thing that is impossible to do with grooved records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Both tape and wire recordings have many advantages over the more conventional groove recording system. There is no needle scratch or background poise. There is practically no wear, even when played thousands of times, and hence no distortion due to wear. Whereas the older records played but a few minutes, and the new long-playing records run but 45 minutes, tape recordings will play from 30 to 60 minutes, and the large studio models run continuously for 8 hours or more. If, on the other hand-, temporary dictation is used, then the recording can be “rubbed out?<sup>7</sup> when its usefulness ends, and the tape or wire can be used over again. This makes for economy. But the initial cost of tape is even less than phonograph recordings on an equal playing-time basis, and with the recent announcement that mass production machinery has been developed for making hour-long tapes, the cost of such will be even cheaper in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Simplicity of recording on wire and tape have permitted these machines to be taken into far-off places where wax recording would be out of the question. Explorers have plunged deep in African jungles and there they have recorded native dance and tribal music, as well as the language of strange people. Scientists have used tape recording to study the languages of birds and animals in zoos, and in the laboratory the marching footsteps of centipedes have been captured. The big broadcasting companies record their programs around the clock on 5,400-foot tapes for the historical record. Schools and business colleges find wire and tape recording very useful in giving instruction in any number of fields. Convention programs are easily and cheaply recorded and later reproduced with an exactness and trueness to life impossible to duplicate in a printed report. If unable to hear certain radio programs at the time of broadcast, individuals can obtain equipment that will automatically record such, and then at a later time it can be played back with absolute fidelity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cut Records Stage a Comeback</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When wire and.tape recording threatened the very existence of the multimillion dollar phonograph business this giant combine marshaled all of its technical resources in a desperate effort to improve groove recording. The results were more than they expected. Last year when Columbia record corporation placed on the market 10- and 12-inch non-breakable records made of vinylite plastic they were hailed as the greatest improvement since the introduction of the automatic record changer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These new records were revolutionary not only in the material out of which they were made, but also in the way they were made. Instead of running at 78 r.p.m. (revolutions per minute) like the old shellac records these vinylite stampings leisurely ran at 33J r.p.m. Also, the grooves of the new records are cut very much smaller and closer together, only .001 instead of .003 of an inch wide. Mierogrooves they are called. This permits a 10-inch record to run from 22 to 27 minutes and a 12-inch record to play for 45 minutes. The old 78’s ran themselves out in a matter of 4 minutes. So close together are the microgrooves that it is estimated that the needle travels a distance of three-quarters of a mile as a 45-minute symphonic piece unwinds. It is this long-playing quality that highly recommends these records to music lovers who enjoy hearing music uninterrupted with record-changing. The other quality possessed by these records is their ability to capture the whole range of audible tones, the high and the low notes, a thing that the old records could not do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The cost of these records, though more per disc, is much less on a playing-time basis. The music on a 12-inch microgroove record costing $4.85 would cost around $8 in an album of 78-r.p.m. records. Space and weight are also greatly reduced by these new records. In space they take up only an eighth as much, and in weight only one-tenth that of the old shellac recordings as figured on playing time. Comparing the new with the old, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consumers' Research</span><span class="font9"> says the long-playing records were “significantly quieter”, had a “wider frequency response, especially in the high register”, and. gave “‘clean’ reproduction of the highs as against a noticeable lack, rather than distortion, of the highs in the regular press-ngs”, There is also “less difference in quality between the outer and inner grooves”, and “beyond any question” these new records have a “wider dynamic range”. Their fidelity is so high that if run on cheap, noisy turntables much of their beauty is lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the 16.000,000 record-users that buy between two hundred million and three hundred million discs a year are to enjoy the pleasures of these records they have to buy new machines or converting units to attach to their old equipment. Special tone arms and pickup heads, as well as slow-running, quiet motors are necessary. Only one-fifth of an ounce pressure on the needle can be used, whereas an ounce of needle pressure is used on the old records. Even dust must be kept at a minimum to avoid “ticks” and other noises in the reproducer. That thousands of consumers have gone to the expense of getting the necessary equipment to handle these new Columbia records is shown by the fact that in less than a year’s time more than 1,500,000 records were sold by this company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Battle of the Record Makers</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It began this last winter. A competitor of Columbia, RCA-Victor, announced they were bringing out a grooved record different from the others. It is a 7-inch vinylite record, having the same high qualities as Columbia’s, but running at 45 r.p.m, instead of 78 or 33J, and having a still smaller groove, only .0009 of an inch, T^hese records have lj-inch holes in the center that fit over a special spindle in which is housed the mechanism for changing the records in less than 3 seconds. With eight records loaded on tlje spindle they will play for 42 minutes. Victor says that this is “the best phonograph record ever made” and the system gives “recorded music a quality and fidelity never before possible at low cost”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, Victor’s announcement had the force of a declaration of war on Columbia, with the poor consumer, as usual, caught in the middle of the fight. Music lovers had not recovered from the financial burden of changing over their equipment to handle Columbia’s new records when Victor told them another layout was necessary if their recordings were to be enjoyed. But even if those financially able do get the necessary equipment it still does not end the consumers confusion. As one frustrated record enthusiast said, in part, in a lamentable letter to the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Imagine the plight of the consumer who wants to listen to an evening of music for which he has selected, say, a London 10-ineh record, a Victor 7-inch, 45 r.p.m, record, a Columbia 10-ineh LP record, and a Victor 78 r.p.m. 12-inch record. He starts with the turntable speed set at 78 r.p.m., a pick-up having a 3 mil tip radius stylus, pressure of one ounce, the automatic record player set to drop the stylus five inches out from the spindle, the equalizer cross-over switch set at 30 cycles, and a little de-emphasis On the high end. Then, after about four minutes of listening, he changes the record, changes the turntable speed to 45 r.pjn., changes the pick-up to one having a ,9 mil tip radius stylus, selects an arm </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">counterbalanced to something else, resets the record player to drop the stylus 3½ inches </span><span class="font9">from the spindle, resets the equalizer crossover to something else, all before he can hear the Victor 7-inch record. For the Columbia 10-inch LP record every one of these adjustments must be made again, and again for the 12-inch Victor 78 r.p.m. record. Heaven help us, especially those who aren't electronic experts!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here is a suggested solution. Magnetic tapes can outstrip grooved records in quality of tone and can outplay them in length of program. Why not, then, let the miracle tapes outproduce both Columbia and Victor in the finest recordings of both popular and classical musicf The enterprising company that successfully challenges and breaks the monopolistic strangle-hold of the big. record cartels will find both customers and friends among music lovers.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Havana’s Daily Bread</span></h1>
<p><span class="font20">Y</span><span class="font9">OU have never visited the big market in Havana? Well, do come along with me while I shop for supper today. Here is where we get off the streetcar. See that huge two-story gray building surrounded by trucks and wagons? That is the market that feeds Havana’s many thousands. It is an entire city block just packed full of one of our greatest daily needs, food, and many other things besides. Watch where you step! That overripe fruit that has fallen off that cart makes walking very treacherous, and inside you will have to look sharp to find a clean path, for it is dark and musty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us follow this man with the basket of fresh watercress balanced on his head up these stairs. If he were carrying a box of oranges or-grapefruit he would cushion his load on a doughnut-like pillow that is worn like a hat. Hear that crowing and racketing? Yes, all the fowl is sold alive: chickens for Cuba’s favorite dish, chicken and rice; turkeys and guineas, wonderful in fricassee, the traditional dish of feasts; And even doves are for sale. That egg department seems to have sold out, for the clerks are now engaged in a lively card game atop the empty crates, quite oblivious to all the bustle of shoppers about them. But here is a great mound of fresh eggs. See the owner candle them? He is a very religious man, for you will notice a tiny wooden shrine to the “Virgin of Char-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490608_files/g_E_19490608-7.png" alt="" style="width:457pt;height:296pt;">

<p><span class="font9">ity” above his head. Later downstairs we shall see a larger one with the virgin's image lighted with tiny electric bulbs and adorned with fresh flowers, and all elaborately topped by a cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Around the corner here ... Whiff that? Fish and more fish. Over 600 kinds swim the blue waters of the Gulf Stream near this sea-coast capital, but not all are eaten. Careful! Those big boxes are full of live crabs and lobsters. You prefer fish steaks? We shall find what we want on these long metal tables. Count them; there are at least 27 tables, and all 50 mackerel like pointed silver arrows? And over there is fresh shrimp, just 35c a pound. Oh, there is a prize red snapper that clerk is cutting up! Ask his price per pound and then offer him*less. You are expected to haggle with them. Knowing prevailing prices is important in this market, for, aside from meat, the price of which is fixed by the government, all prices are flexible and you can always get a better buy with an independent merchant than at the larger places. On we go slushing through the narrow passages where the melted ice flows like tiny streams. Some of yesterday’s sardines were dumped under that table, and look now. This is truly a cat’s paradise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Next to the fish department come the meat stalls. The huge slabs of meat hung on those wicked-looking hooks above the marble counters are just as they came from the slaughterhouse today without benefit of long chilling. Notice, however, that, unlike the fish department, here each stall has a refrigerator where at least some of the meat is kept. Beyond those gory pigs’ heads there is beef </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and tender</span><span class="font9"> kidney. You may ask the owner for first class meat for steaks, for instance, or second class for stew, and he will cut the number of pieces off the very slab that most appeals to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We leave the meat shops behind as on we go pushing this way and that, trying to avoid all the wandering vendors who would sell you a mahogany end table or native hand-woven shopping bags and hats. Let us stop at this counter and have a tiny cup of sweet black Cuban coffee as a pick-me-up. If you are really hungry we can get a piece of fried fish or chicken or one of the corn tamales wrapped in corn husks that lady is dipping out of her </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">steaming cauldron over </span><span class="font9">there. No? Well, we shall avoid the many tables of cloth, hats, jewelry and other trinkets and follow the cjrowd down this wide staircase to the fruits and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Don’t Get Lost!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bid I say fruits and vegetables? We seem to be in the hardware store. I will admit there is little order in the market. One must come several times before he is sure not to get lost. There are the fruits? See the pineapples over there? Piled right on the floor, and they are going fast. Here the Cuban variety whose meat is white are more in demand than the better-known yellow ones. The coconuts piled, beside them are green and used only for their milk; but there are plenty of dried ones. Later there will be an abundance of alligator pears, mangos, guavas, sweet custard apples, sour-sop, sweet-sop, mamey, and that most delicious of melons, papaya. Grapes, apples and pears are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">imported.</span><span class="font9"> American lemons are rare, but we use limes preferably as a drink or to flavor our cooking. Would you like some of the familiar Johnson eating bananas, or would you rather try one of the little fat Cuban kind or even a red one? The big long yellow bapanas over there are to cook (most folks prefer them fried)., and that maze of stalks beyond are green bananas considered a vegetable by most Cubans. They take the place of bread in all country families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Past those barrels of bright green peppers and golden squash the rays of the hot morning sun stream in to us from the open square in the center of the market's first floor where the wagons are unloading the produce. Those men seem to form a continual stream as they fill their baskets with the many local root vegetables, returning in a minute with a pile of empty ones to refill. They are sure-footed, too, for they do not slip as they run barefoot among all the garbage </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">that in spite of the signs posted no </span><span class="font9">one bothers to gather up and dispose of. Two beggar children with gunny sacks over their thin shoulders make a pathetic picture scavenging among the bruised oranges and wormy ears of corn that are tossed aside in the rush. Amid the babel we faintly hear a voice over the loud-speaker asking who has lost a little girl, and later assuring us all that her father had claimed her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We must still buy some rice, which is perhaps the most important staple in this country; so follow me past these stalls where the Chinamen, the island’s truck farmers/ display fresh greens, beets and carrots. Oh, yes, we need some cooking tomatoes. They are different from the ones for salad, for they are tiny, scarlet, very acid, and cheap too, only a penny for two. But do not try to eat them raw; they will make you quite sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those huge barrels we have been passing are full of unrefined sugar, quite as good as the usual white kind, and cheaper. Other barrels are full of red, black or white beans. That stall has homemade sweets: coconut candy, prune puree, canned fruits and honey. Notice the big tin tray of honeycombs just as it came from the country this morning. It is a rich yellow almost the color of those cheeses, and sweet—anyway, the flies seem to find it so!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Row upon row of Spanish wines and other liquors are displayed against a backdrop of homemade ladies’ slips that the owner’s wife undoubtedly hopes to sell. He will fill up my little bottle with dry wine for cooking for a nickel. Aside from small similar purchases his business has not been so good since the December holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Holiday Feasting</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I wish you could have been with me here before the holidays. The already jammed corridors were bulging with many tiny tables topped by precariously stacked wine bottles, and everywhere whole roast suckling pigs met your eye. These could be bought whole or in part. Some were quite gallantly decorated. I remember one that had grapes wedged in the empty eyesockets for eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Great quantities of grapes were also coming in then in preparation for New Year’s Eve, for it is an old custom to eat 12 grapes at midnight as the old year dies, one for each month of the coming year, for luck. A clean start for the New Year is also assured, they say, by throwing a pailful of water out of the front door at midnight. Thus the sidewalks get a bath, and more than occasionally some unfortunate passer-by. The majority of Cuba’s holiday celebrating, however, is done in the dining room, judging by the prodigious quantities of food bought in preparation, for economy is thrown to the winds. almost every family has roast pork and, to complement it, great bunches of crisp leaf lettuce. And, of course, plenty of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That reminds me to stop here at the bakeshop for one of the crisp white yard-long loaves of bread. This bread, together with coffee and milk, constitutes the Cuban breakfast. The many fancy cakes may catch your eye, too, but homemade ones taste better no matter how pretty these appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And now home. While I start the charcoal fire in the kitchen would you like to hear some of the secrets of Cuban cookery! The basis of each meal is rice; fluffy, dry grains. You will see yellow rice on restaurant menus; but it does not grow that way, so do not ask for yellow rice when you go to shop. It is made by adding a small le envelope of &quot;Bijol” to give it color. Originally Spanish saffron toasted and powdered gave both the delicate yellow tint and a subtle flavor, but the commercial substitute on the market now just preserves the tradition of the yellow color. The meat dish is often a stew-like mixture such as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ajeaco,</span><span class="font9"> Boiled pork ribs are added to several cooked vegetables such as carrots, ripe and green bananas, yams and squash, all flavored and cooked slowly with a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sofrito,</span><span class="font9"> that is, a partly-fried sauce of onions, tomatoes, green pepper and garlic chopped in oil. Another daily favorite is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">congri</span><span class="font9"> or black beans and rice. Make the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sofrito</span><span class="font9"> without tomatoes this time but use bacon and a laurel or bay leaf. Add with the washed raw rice when beans are soft, and cook slowly. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Potaje</span><span class="font9"> is a stew stand-by made of beans, beef, bacon, potatoes, and squash with the inevitable </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sofrito</span><span class="font9"> (plenty of tomatoes this time) flavored with laurel, a bit of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">oregano,</span><span class="font9"> that is, wild marjoram, and the Bijol coloring. Dried codfish is also prepared with the fried tomato sauce and is most tasty with Cuban sweet potatoes. A typical dessert is custard, rich with many eggs, or perhaps rice with milk, the lemon rind and stick cinnamon and anise which are added giving it a distinctive flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But tonight we shall have chicken and rice, mixed green salad, fried green bananas, and, for dessert, cream cheese with sugary guava halves. Won’t you stay for dinner?—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> correspondent in Cuba.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">of wild life never cease at the skill and ingenuity which animals employ to solve the problems of their existence. In the neverending struggle to be, to remain, and to reproduce, necessity is laid upon some to kill for food. Nearly all will resist attack. Wars of aggression, however, they wisely leave to their reputedly more intelligent human co-sharers of earth. But while the severe exigencies of their uncertain lives require their undivided attention, engaging their entire time in pursuit of necessities for self, family or tribe, yet many instances of astonishing co-operation and friendships have become well known to observers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The phenomenal partnerships are revealed among the lowest as well as the highest forms of animal life. For example, the peculiar ability of the termite to digest wood, a feat unique among animal digestive systems, aroused the curiosity of scientists. Experiment and research disclosed that small animal bodies (infusoria) in the food canal enabled the termite to assimilate the wood. (The scientific term describing such co-operation, which is essential to the lives of both, is &quot;symbiosis” or &quot;mutualism”.) Stranger perhaps is the alliance between the sea anemone and the herfnit crab. Looking very much like a turban, the anemone gets a free ride on the crab’s back, and in return brings food and protection to its mount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sea anenome belongs to the family of marine life whose skeletons form coral. In repose it resembles an open</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19490608_files/g_E_19490608-9.png" alt="" style="width:176pt;height:58pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">sack. But when danger threatens or an unwary fish swims by, the anemone opens up at the top like a flower, waving out tentacles that sting and stun. Some varieties attract by their bright pink color, while others are large enough to capture a good-sized fish. Undigested parts may be thrown out at the top of the living “sack” at the same opening through which the fish was taken in, and these remains furnish a meal for the crab. Enemies such as the cuttlefish are not anxious to devour the crab's anemone crown, which, no doubt, accounts in part for its transferring both its “turban” and the other small animals often found adhering, to its new shell. Some species of crab, like a “pistol-packing mama”, go forth to the hunt carrying an anemone in each claw to catch food and ward off danger!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Certain .brilliant-hued fish act as lures for the anemones and other actinians (corals), leading their pursuers to the &quot;mouth of the sack”, through which they dive unhurt to the central recess or stomach, while the attacking fish is stunned by the nettles and later devoured. Thus the decoy fish furnishes the anemone with food in RS return for protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Similarly the gullets of sea cucumbers and starfish furnish hiding places for the eellike fierasfer; while a species of Brazilian catfish is said to shelter other small fish within its mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mutual aid is reported among other denizens of the sea. One scientist watched a red goatfish hunting frequently with a small yellowtail. The larger goatfish stirred up the mud while its companion swam near by to snap up the fish that escaped. (To such mutual aid that is not essential but does benefit both parties, Jn distinction from &quot;parasitism” which injures one participant, scientists apply the term &quot;commensalism”.) A small fish native to the waters of the Tortugas renders a vermin removal service to larger fish. During the process any interference is met with stern resistance by recipi</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">ents of the treatment. Repeat visits have also been observed. The pilot fish performs a similar favor for the shark, and is itself protected by proximity to that tiger of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jockeys and Their Mounts</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whenever animal ingenuity and industry come under consideration the ant always takes a preferred place. Its variety establishment, so deservedly commended, includes a dairy stables, a commissary, as well as divers apartments and nurseries. In their well-organized community life they even perform their burial ceremonies and bake their tiny food loaves in the sun before storing them underground. The ant acts as mount for the “sweet-producing” aphids, which it carefully pastures out on succulent new shoots of roses, citrus, and other plants—to the exasperation of growers—and later the ant “milks” out the aphids' sweet excretion. “Herds” of aphids are maintained in underground quarters, receiving better treatment than most domestic animals that serve men. While prevented from escape by walls with entrances too small for passage by the “cows” but large enough for the ant “wranglers”, yet so careful is the “herding” that sometimes ■ “colonies of aphids jiave been carried by ants Jo fresh stables”. Various ant “ranches” also include Green flies, lantern flies, jumping plant lice,’the caterpillars of a butterfly that passes its entire life in the ant colony, and a blind “milch” beetle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are also equestrians of the bird world. Many of these, unlike the destructive kca parrot that plagues the ranchers of New Zealand by pecking holes in the hacks of live sheep, perform useful services while riding. The emouran, a large rodent in Mongolia, is said by Ossendowski to be attended by a lark which perches on its back, picks off parasites, flies above its host, and gives cries to give notice of danger. Frequently observed riding upon the back of the elephant is the beautifully costumed egret, while the “beefeater” bird finds substance in the larvae (warbles) on the backs of buffaloes. The cowbird picks at insects as acceptable “fare” for its ride on stock. Champion, however, of the bird derby is probably the little, rosy bee eater of Rhodesia. His favorite mount is the large crested bustard, or “pauw”, a well-known South African game bird, an amusing account of which is given by an explorer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It sits far back on the rump of its mount, as a boy rides a donkey. The “pauw” does not *seem to resent this liberty, but stalks majestically along while its brilliantly-clad jockey keeps a lookout, sitting sideways, and now and again flies up and after an insect it has spied, returning after the chase to &quot;its</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">camel”, as Juma (a native servant) called it. I have noticed this pretty little creature sitting on the backs of goats, sheep and antelopes, but the &quot;pauw” seems its favorite steed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Friendships</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most animals stand in wholesome fear of the great Alaskan moose; which towers above all its fellow inhabitants of the vast sub-Arctic wilderness. Yet one of the least courageous animals, the coyote, was observed enjoying a repast that the northland monarch provided. A curious explorer followed the whole episode. Cautiously the coyote approached the moose from the rear, and then as if recognizing a tactical error he boldly advanced almost under the forefeet of the grazing giant. Apparently the moose sensed the good intentions of the other, and continued tolerantly to kick at snowladen tufts of grass, munching contentedly. The pawings of its great hoofs dislodged the snow, and frequently sent field mice scurrying for cover. But their flight was cut short, as the snapping jaws of the coyote gobbled them up. These curious messmates continued in this fashion until the appetite of both had been satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most curious though of ail services rendered is that of the black-backed courser or crocodile bird, stories of whose flights into the very mouths of crocodiles are now accepted fact. Leeches infest the bodies and at times the mouths of crocodiles, which parasites the courser delights to pick off. At times as the monster dozes with its mouth partly open, the bold little fellow flies into its very jaws, picking leeches and even particles of food lodged between its teeth. Apparently lacking complete faith in the sufferance of the great reptile, it never takes time to turn around after feeding between the jaws, but flies out backwards!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While these instances of animal cooperation are the exception rather than the rule, because heavy necessity is usually laid upon all wild life to fend for itself, yet they furnish bright promise of the friendly relations that are assured for the New World. Then, says Jehovah's infallible word: &quot;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.’'—Isaiah 11: 6; 65: 25,</span></p>

For about a year we were both in a state of complete mental confusion, always hoping that somewhere we could read an article where the truth publications would analyze this theory.

<p><span class="font9">N THE original Greek text of the Christian Scriptures the word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">psyche </span><span class="font9">occurs 105 times, but only 58 times is this word from which we get the word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">psychology</span><span class="font9"> translated “soul”, Onee.it is translated “heart”, once “heartily” in a phrase, three times “mind”, once “us”, once “you”, anc| forty times “life”, in the King James Version Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among these variations in translation the3ible translators have especially hidden the truth about the human soul by rendering </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">psyche</span><span class="font9"> into English as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">life. </span><span class="font9">It has tended to give us the idea that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font9"> is one thing and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font9"> is another thing.

<p><span class="font9">In this last text as in several preceding ones the thought is that Christ’s footstep follow'ers are to remember that their present existence as souls is under decree of death anyway; but that God’s grace has provided redemption and, after death, a resurrection, a living again, in the New World. The call of this Christian era is for Christ’s spirit-begotten followers to lay down their lives in God’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">service, as living sacrifices,</span><span class="font9"> following the example of Christ Jesus. The divine promise is that all consecrated believers in Christ who do so, faithfully, will be granted a share with Him in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;divine nature”, through the operation of the &quot;first resurrection”. Thus, though they lose human soul in God’s service on earth, they will be rewarded with soul as immortal spirits in the heavenly kingdom.—2 Peter 1:4; Revelation 20: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;The good shepherd giveth his life </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche,</span><span class="font9"> soul] for the sheep.” &quot;I lay down my life </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche,</span><span class="font9"> soul] for the sheep.” &quot;I lay down my life </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche, </span><span class="font9">soul], that I might [receive] it again?’ (John 10:11,15,17) Jesus the Good Shepherd “poured out his </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font9"> unto death” and “thou shalt make his </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font9"> an offering for sin”. (Isa. 53:12, 10) By the resurrection from the dead Christ Jesus took up or received life as a soul, but this time in the spirit realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“He that loveth his life </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche,</span><span class="font9"> soul] shall lose it; and he that hateth his life </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche,</span><span class="font9"> soul] in this world shall [preserve] it unto life eternal.”—John 12:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The thought here is that faithfulness to God under present evil conditions means necessarily not setting one’s heart upon the present things of enjoyment but being willing to sacrifice human life with all it means in the service of Jehovah God and of his Kingdom. According to the divine provision, a person doing so will be accounted worthy of life as a soul under the blessed conditions of the world to come. He, though, who loves the present condition of things and who values the enjoyments and pleasures of the present world higher than he values righteousness and obedience to God will thus be proving himself unworthy of the future life as a soul.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The apostle Paul had learned to view the present life as a soul rightly, as of small value in comparison with the fu-tnre one promised in the &quot;first resurrection”. He did not count it &quot;dear” or precious in the sense of being more valuable than God and Christ and their favor or than the opportunities for serving them. See Philippians 3: 8-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">&quot;The third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche, </span><span class="font9">soul], died.”—Revelation 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;They loved not their lives </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[psyche, </span><span class="font9">soul] unto the death .&quot;-Revelation 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus we see that the word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font9"> not only applies to a living individual, as at 1 Corinthians 15:45, reading: &quot;The first man Adam was made a living soul [psyche]?’ The word also applies to one’s life as a soul, and in this Way a person can lose his soul. God can destroy this soul forever, by refusing to resurrect a person who is a willful, irreform-able sinner from the dead in the new world. As Jesus said: &quot;Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Gehenna;</span><span class="font9"> annihilation]?’ (Matthew 10:28) It takes individual research in the Bible, therefore, to uncover the truth which Bible translators have hid about the soul, showing that the human soul is mortal and not indestructible. Hope of life for the dead lies in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Ban of Jesuits in Swiss Constitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The so-called “ban of the Jes-* uits&quot; (Jesuit Interdiction) was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font9"> introduced into the Swiss Fed-Constitution one hundred and one years ago in order to counteract the progress of the fanatical, peacedisturbing spirit of political Catholicism under the .leadership of the Jesuits. And, be it noted, it was not the Protestants (who constitute the majority of the Swiss people) who demanded this Jesuit clause, but rather good Catholics who knew that the Jesuits are detrimental to the people because they crudely disturb the peaceful living side by side of the two confessions, and were the repeated cause of religious wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The original “ban&quot; applies only to their activity in churches or (convent) schools, however. It has its origin in 1848, but in 1874, on the basis of further bad experiences, this provision had to be made more severe by adding that it can be extended to other clerical orders inimical to the state if they disturb the religious peace. These restrictions have been frequently and obviously violated in later years. Reformed Church Synods and the newspapers have often protested against these violations of the constitution. On the other hand, Catholics under Jesuit influence protest against this so-called “exceptional clause’;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is the main object of the Jesuit Order to fanatically exterminate “Protestant heretics” out of all countries with all the means at their disposal. In a country like Switzerland, with a Protestant majority, this is naturally hot possible without disturbing the peace. A teacher of public law, Fleiner, whose fame has extended far beyond our boundaries, has touched on the essence of the question in the following words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society of Jesus (society Jesu) according to its tendencies and methods is an </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">enemy of </span><span class="font9">the principles upon which the Fed</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">eral </span><span class="font9">constitution is based, and combats the authority of the state neutral in matters of faith, with all the means of which the Order has art its disposal in virtue of its military organization and the absolute spiritual obedience of its members. The Society of Jesus, the very Order for the fighting of Protestantism, rejects the equality of rights of the faiths in the state and seeks to establish the exclusive'domination of the Catholic Church </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">public life. [F, Fleiner. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Swiss Constitutional Law,</span><span class="font9"> pages 325-367]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Canton Against the Jesuits!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Swiss history bears record of what a representative of the government in the Catholic canton of Ticino, Colonel Lu-vini, officially stated regarding the troublesome peace-breakers, the Jesuits:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Canton, which it is my honor to represent, is wholly of Catholic faith. In the first provisions of its constitution, the Catholic faith is declared to be its state religion, and its laws tender the proof of in what deep respect we hold the faith of our fathers. And notwithstanding this, the Canton of Ticino unhesitatingly declared itself against the Jesuits and numbered itself among those who desired to have them removed from the Confederation. And this for the reason that Canton Ticino can recognize no religious, no confessional question in the Jesuit question. It is not such, gentlemen, because the Society&quot; of Jesus, from its inception till this very day is counted in the eyes of eminent men, in the eyes of Catholic social or spiritual dignitaries, or by the Catholics who are known for their faithful adherence to the teachings and rites of Catholicism, as an institution which has </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">been</span><span class="font9"> created </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font9"> the purpose of attaining supreme power, be it in monarchial or republican states. In its essence, the Jesuit question is no more and no less than a political question. The Jesuits, as the declared enemies of the equality of state subjects, of the freedom of the press, and of education extended to all the people under the supervision of the state, threaten by their continual dangerous expan-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sion the liberties so dearly bought by the Federal Cantons,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On July 21, 1773, Pope Clement XIV issued a papal brief, in which “Our Lord and Saviour” is played out against the order, which, calling itself after Him as the “Society of Jesus” in reality misused the munificence shown by the popes toward them in the most disgraceful manner, kindled strife “almost all over the world”, and according to the judgment of “our beloved sons, the kings of France, Spain and Portugal and both Sicilies” have proved themselves ripe for dissolution. Therefore “after mature consideration, on the grounds of certain knowledge and out of the abundance of apostolic power, we dissolve this Society and suppress it” radically as laid down in detailed provisions. ... In 1814 “the anxiety for all the churches” drove Pope Pius VII to restore the “Society of Jesus”. (J. Boni, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Jesuit Question, </span><span class="font9">page 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the foregoing impartial judgments of Catholic men of authority every person of good-will should now judge whether the Jesuits should be considered as disturbers of the peace or not</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Exceptional Laws?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Are so-called “exceptional laws” against willful disturbers of the peace contrary to the spirit of a democratic constitution? Is the “Jesuit ban” in any way contrary to the equality of rights of confessions? By no means! No Catholic is deprived of his rights by the constitution. However/ the fanatical Jesuits are naturally not allowed to exterminate those of a different faith under the protection of the constitution. If a Society has as its aim and purpose to destroy the denominational equality of rights of citizens, to make Catholics of “heretics” or to extirpate them, then such a Society may not rightly expect protection from the constitution. The time would now be ripe for the Jesuits to prove that they acknowledge the right of equality of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Protestants. Only then would the “exceptional laws” against them be superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the records of the activity of the Jesuits it is known that already a year after the entry of the Jesuits into Freiburg, Switzerland, it was ruled that no citizen may send his children to Berne or Geneva for education, or have them placed into Protestant families anywhere. later it was decreed in Canton Schwyz that only the Papal Church was recognized and that no permission of domicile should be issued to non-Catho-lics to settle in this canton. Mixed marriages, that is, marriages between Catholics and Protestants, were prohibited. Only the fundamental provisions of the Federal Constitution checked this tendency and established order. And now is it expected to again concede the legal freedom to this intolerant Catholic Society to suppress their opponents as in former times?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Distinguished theologians of the Reformed National Church answer that the Protestants of that time did not ask for the adoption of the Jesuit clause, and that they have no interest in its maintenance. Nevertheless, the removal of the “ban” should not be accomplished by way of the secret evasion so often practiced by Catholics in recent years. If it came to a discussion before a national plebiscite the Jesuits would manifestly have to admit that their real aim is to make all Switzerland Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few questions should be examined, as, for instance: What have been the effects of manifest violations of the constitution .with regard to the religious peace that the Jesuits have made themselves guilty of in Switzerland in the past 15 years? Are certain principles of Jesuit thought arid action compatible with the guaranteed legal benefits of freedom of faith and conscience as guaranteed by the Federal constitution ? Can the Jesuits produce the evidence to the Swiss people that they are willing and ready to respect the religibus peace and the foundation of our constitutional state!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesuits Fear Popular Vote</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such questions, which aim,at the heart of the matter and are not ingenious legal trickery are not pleasant to the Jesuits. In any case, the Jesuits do not wish today to follow the straightforward and only clean way to a revision of the constitution, thafis, by popular vote. They do not find it necessary either, as long as so many Protestant men in governmental authority so generously tolerate the evasion in practice of the Jesuit ban. It is also interesting to learn what the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Protestant</span><span class="font9"> (1947, No. 7, Zurich) reports on’this subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But as stated, till today the Catholies have not followed this course (the partial revision of the clause in the constitution), the only straightforward way mentioned. They fear that a legal initiative (that is, the provoking of a national plebiscite by obtaining a sufficient number of signatures of practiced in Switzerland) would not lead to success. Indeed, it is even feared by certain persons that not even all Cantons with a Catholic majority would vote for the revocation of the Jesuit clause. Above all, they do not trust the attitude of the Freiburg Catholics. It is known that the late highly esteemed Bishop Besson was against the Jesuits, and it is feared that the people of Canton Freiburg could share his views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If Catholics are against the Jesuits, and if deceased bishops and popes were likewise, then the conclusion is surely justified that the “Society of Jesus’<sup>1</sup> is, after all, not so harmless as Jesuits would like to represent themselves to unknowing Protestants. And so it can be said of the Jesuit clause what Paul stated regarding the law of Moses, “that the law not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners.” (1 1 Timothy 1:9)—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> correspondent in Switzerland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL ---' ___</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Federal German Republic</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Planned</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;$&gt; The draft of the Western German constitution was under consideration at Bonn, Germany, In late April. On the 24th the two major parties appeared tn have reached some kind of agreement. The next day envoys from the VarHamentary Council met with the military governors of the Western powers at Frankfort and agreed upon disputed points. Yet the Germans hesitated on the establishment of a Western German state as a Federal German Republic. The occupying powers of the U. S., Britain and France were anxious to get It going, and to Jine it up in the general plan for Western Europe. At Lake Success (April 29} Jacob A. Malik. Soviet representative to the U. N\. tacitly agreed that the proposed meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers on Germany would not interfere with the plan of establishing a Western German government. It was reported that the U. S. and Britain would propose at the impending council that the Soviet zone be merged with the other zones in the forming of a single federal state. The Russians were understood </span><a href="http://to.be"><span class="font7">to .be </span></a><span class="font7">in favor of a centra Hied German, government. Dr. Kurt Schumacher, leader of the Social Democratic party, de-vlared that Germany must place ‘’its own demands’<sup>1</sup> before the Council of Foreign Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">16-30</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">China’s Wooden Ramparts</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;$&gt; The wooden fence which the Chinese erected around Shanghai was a fitting symbol of the power of its resistance before the onward sweep of Communist troops from the north. On the banks of the Yangtze these fore* es were poised nearly a million strong, ready in mid-Aprll cross and carry everything to the south before them. But they had a mind to bargain. If they could go forward without resistance, that would be even better. They had made peace proposals which included practically complete surrender by the National* 1st government, capitulation by the disheartened troops defending China ineffectively, though 500,000 strong. The constitution of China must also be abolished-Nationalist China rejected the terms. The Communists began to more forward. The capital dty of Hankow was abandoned by the Nationalists. Toward the close of the month gunfire heard north of Hangchow and Nationalist officials were fleeing the city. Shanghai, behind her wooden ramparts, watted tensely. Some 1800 Americans resident In the great city were counseled to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">British Ships Attacked</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;$&gt; Four British Royal Navy ships found themselves in ft tight spot In late April Sailing on the Yangtze they were fired upon by Communist artillery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Forty-four British seamen were </span><span class="font7">killed and a hundred wounded. Mast severely hit was the frigate Amethyst, which was Isolated near Chiukiang, forty rolIeS from Nanking. Rescue attempts </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">hindered but finally accomplished. The resulting agitation was permitted to die down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lifting the Berlin Blockade</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;$&gt; Moves on the part of Russia suggesting that the Berlin blockade might be lifted were in evidence In late April. The blockade had been set up ten months before to squeeze out the U. ST., Britain and France from the old German capital But without success. The amazing ‘’airlift<sup>1</sup>* carried In enough supplier to keep the three zones of Western occupation warmed, clothed and fed. U. S. and British fliers In mid-April flew 12,040 tons of supplies into Berlin in one day, making 1,308 flights. The evidence was clear that the blockaded zones could be fed and supplied by the “airlift” indefinitely. Meanwhile the Russian zone Of occupation was not faring so well, for It was blockaded by the Western powers, as far as getting any supplies from the rest of Germany was concerned. So talks about lifting the Russian blockade were begun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Truman Sign® EGA Aid Bill</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;$&gt; Legislation authorizing $5,430,000,000 for the European Recovery Program was signed by President Truman April 19. It covered requirements for the next fifteen months. Tne Economic Cooperation Administration, which is the agency supervising the program, at once drafted a request for $1,000,000,000 as a starter. A week later the president asked that the total sum be reduced by $157,800,000. While lending all this money to Europe, it is observed that the U.S. is itself in the red to the tune of a quarter of a trillion dollars, $250,000,000,000. The debt carries with it the possibility of Inflation, instability economically, depression and loss of personal freedoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S. Secretary of Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Import ant decisions were made by the new U. 8. secretary of defense, Louis Johnson, in late April. On the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">19th he</span><span class="font7"> abolished 21 boards and committees in the National Military Establishment. Many of them were quite useless. On the 20th he ordered into effect a policy of racial equality for the National Military Establishment, and a week later .named James </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">C. </span><span class="font7">Evans, ftegro engineer, to be his civilian assistant for problems relating to racial equality. A </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font7">spectacular decision </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">made when Johnson ordered all work stopped on the navy’s super-aircraft carrier, the 65,000-ton United States. The order was given to John L. Sullivan, secret </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tary </span><span class="font7">of the navy, in a brief note, containing but two sentences. Mr. Sullivan did not like the idea very much, and on the 2dth turned In bls resignation, to be made effective as soon as possible.</span></p>

Estimates put the annual outlays required at about $7,000,000,000, to be financed by a 3-percqnt payroll tax, employers and employees paying 11 percent each. An omnibus bill to carry out the program was fn-troduced In both houses of Congress April 25. Catholic groups opposed the program, saying it ’would make health care “practically a government monopoly”. The American Medical Association and the American Pharmaceutical Association also opposed the plan, saying it would lead to inefficiency and Inferior treatment, lowering the standards of American health.</span></p>

The Wood hill sought to retain much of the old bill, but the Lesinski bill, also presented, wanted to reinstate the earlier Wagner Act, with a few minor changes. The president, at a press conference, said he would consider votes on these bills a test of party loyalty. He backs the Lesinski bill. His remarks were widely condemned, as being coerci re.</span></p>
