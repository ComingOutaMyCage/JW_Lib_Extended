<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A concubine of King Saul; daughter of Aiah.

As a consequence, Abner defected to David.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:3:7-10:3:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 3:7-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Rizpah had given birth to two sons by Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth. Long after Saul’s death, David took these two sons of Rizpah along with five other descendants of Saul and handed them over to the Gibeonites, to be slain, in order to remove bloodguilt from the land. The seven were exposed on a mountain, where Rizpah guarded their bodies from the birds and wild beasts “from the start of harvest until water poured down upon them from the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:1-10:21:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 21:1-10</a>) This indefinite period of time may have been five or six months, unless, as some suggest, there was an exceptional, out-of-season downpour. Such a heavy rain before October would have been most unusual.
