<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">CHARLES TAZE RUSSELL, known the world over as Pastor Russell, author, lecturer and minister of the Gospel, was born at Pittsburgh, Pa., February 16, 1852; died October 31, 1916.  He was the son of Joseph L. and Eliza Birney Russell, both of Scotch-Irish lineage.  He was educated in the common schools and under private tutors.  Author of &quot;OBJECT AND MANNER OF OUR LORD'S RETURN,&quot; &quot;FOOD FOR THINKING CHRISTIANS,&quot; &quot;TABERNACLE SHADOWS,&quot; &quot;THE DIVINE PLAN OF THE AGES,&quot; &quot;THE TIME IS AT HAND,&quot; &quot;THY KINGDOM COME,&quot; &quot;THE BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON,&quot; &quot;THE ATONEMENT,&quot; &quot;THE NEW CREATION,&quot; &quot;WHAT SAY THE SCRIPTURES ABOUT HELL,&quot; &quot;SPIRITISM,&quot; &quot;OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS,&quot; &quot;THE PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION,&quot; et cetera, et cetera.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was married in 1879 to Maria Frances Ackley. No children blessed this union.  Seventeen years later they disagreed about the management of his journal and a separation followed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Reared under the influence of Christian parents, at an early age he became interested in theology, uniting himself with the Congregational Church, and became active in local mission work.  The doctrine of eternal torment of all mankind except the few elect became so abhorrent to him that at the age of seventeen he was a skeptic.  He said, &quot;A God that would use His power to create human beings whom He foreknew and predestinated should be eternally tormented, could be neither wise, just nor loving; His standard would be lower than that of many men.&quot;  He continued to believe, however, in the existence of God, but was not willing to accept the commonly understood teachings as God's revelation of Himself to man. He turned his attention to the investigation of heathen religions, only to find all of these unsatisfactory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                 </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HIS TEACHINGS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Naturally of a reverential mind, desiring to worship and serve the true God, he reasoned, &quot;All the creeds of Christendom claim to be founded on the Bible, and these are conflicting.  Is it possible that the Bible has been misrepresented?  It may not teach the terrible doctrine of eternal torment.&quot;  Turning again to the Bible he determined to make a careful, systematic study of it without reference to creeds of men.  As a result the remainder of his life was wholly devoted to teaching the Bible, writing and publishing religious books and papers, lecturing and proclaiming the message of Messiah's Kingdom. He was the greatest religious teacher since St. Paul, and did more than any other man of modern times to establish the faith of the people in the Scriptures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was not the founder of a new religion, and never made such claim.  He revived the great truths taught by Jesus and the Apostles, and turned the light of the twentieth century upon these.  He made no claim of a special revelation from God, but held that it was God's due time for the Bible to be understood; and that, being fully consecrated to the Lord and to His service, he was permitted to understand it.  Because he devoted himself to the development of the fruits and graces of the Holy Spirit, the promise of the Lord was fulfilled in him: &quot;For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;--`2 Peter 1:5-8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He clearly taught and proved his teachings by the citation of Scriptural authority--that man does not possess an immortal soul, that he is a soul and is mortal; that the wages of sin is death--not eternal torment; that death came upon man as the just penalty for the violation of God's Law; that death means the destruction of man; that God, in His goodness, has provided the great Ransom-price whereby man may be delivered from the bondage of Sin and Death; that God's beloved Son, Jesus, became a man and grew to manhood's estate, was put to death as a man and raised again from the dead a spirit-being, possessing the Divine nature; that by His death and resurrection Christ Jesus provided and produced the Ransom-price for man's deliverance and restoration; that Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man; that every man in God's due time must, therefore, have a fair trial for life, and to this end there shall be a resurrection of all the dead; that Jesus Christ ascended into Heaven and must come the second time; that the period of time elapsing between the First and the Second Coming of the Lord is devoted to the election of the members of the Body of Christ, taken from amongst men; that the requirements for election to that exalted position are, full faith in the shed blood of Jesus as the Ransom-price, a full consecration to do the Father's will, and a faithful continuance in obedience to the Father's will even unto death; that all who thus are consecrated and begotten of the Holy Spirit and are overcomers shall have part in the Chief Resurrection, and be exalted to positions in the Heavenly Kingdom of God and participate with Christ Jesus in His Millennial Reign for the blessing of all the families of the earth; that during the thousand-year reign of Christ all of the dead shall be awakened, and given a fair and impartial trial for life or death; that under said Reign the wilfully disobedient shall be everlastingly destroyed, while those obedient to the righteous rule of Christ shall be fully restored to human perfection of body, mind and character; that during this Millennial Reign the earth shall be brought to a state of Edenic</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paradise and made fit as a place habitable for perfect man; that man, fully restored to perfection, will inhabit the beautiful earth in all the ages to come.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                    </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HIS WORK</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Seeing that God has such a wonderful Plan for the blessing of mankind, Pastor Russell gave all of his power and energy to making known these great truths to the world.  He never took a vacation; he worked until the day of his death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Like other Christians he was looking for the Second Coming of Christ.  Between 1872-6 he discovered that the Scriptures clearly teach that the Lord would not return in a body of flesh, but would return as a spirit being, invisible to human eyes, and that His second presence was due in the autumn of 1874.  This led to the publishing of a booklet entitled, &quot;The Object and Manner of Our Lord's Return,&quot; which had a phenomenal circulation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Many students of the Bible throughout the United States and Canada responded to the information derived from that book, and his correspondence became voluminous. Realizing the necessity of keeping the Truth before the minds of those who had begun to investigate, in 1879 he began the publication of THE WATCH TOWER AND HERALD OF CHRIST'S PRESENCE, and was its sole Editor to the time of his death.  This journal is issued semi-monthly; it never publishes advertisements, but is devoted exclusively to religious topics.  Among the English speaking people in the United States, Canada and Great Britain, its semi-monthly circulation is 45,000 copies. It is also published in German, French, Swedish, Dano-Norwegian and Polish, reaching a large number of subscribers in America and Europe.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was President of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY from its organization in 1884 until his death.  He was also President of the PEOPLES PULPIT ASSOCIATION, organized in 1909, and the INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION, incorporated in London, in 1913, both of the latter corporations being adjuncts to the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY.  Through these religious corporations, as well as by word of mouth, he promulgated the Gospel of Messiah's Kingdom.  He was the author of the following publications, issued between the years 1881 and 1914, each having phenomenal circulation, as given below:</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was also the author of WHAT SAY THE SCRIPTURES ABOUT SPIRITISM, OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS, et cetera, et cetera.  He was the author of the PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION, which had been exhibited prior to his death to more than nine million persons.  He wrote and published the SCENARIO of the PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION, which has had a very wide circulation.  His publications were translated into thirty-five different languages.  At the same time he was Pastor of more than 1,200 congregations of Bible Students, in different parts of the world. These he visited and taught as often as possible.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He organized and conducted a Lecture Bureau which constantly employed seventy Bible lecturers, who traveled and delivered lectures on the Scriptures.  He organized and managed an auxiliary lecture bureau of seven hundred men who gave a portion of their time to lecturing on Bible teachings.  Each year he wrote practically all of the copy for the BIBLE STUDENTS MONTHLY, the annual distribution of which amounted to approximately fifty million copies.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His weekly sermons were handled by a newspaper syndicate.  More than 2,000 newspapers, with a combined circulation of fifteen million readers, at one time published his discourses.  All told, more than 4,000 newspapers published these sermons.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Continent,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a publication whose editor often opposed Pastor Russell, once published the following significant statement concerning him:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;His writings are said to have greater newspaper circulation every week than those of any other living man; a greater, doubtless, than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America; greater even than the work of Arthur Brisbane, Norman Hapgood, George Horace Lorimer, Dr. Frank Crane, Frederick Haskins, and a dozen other of the best known editors and syndicate writers put together.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HARVEST WORK</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Pastor Russell adhered closely to the teachings of the Scriptures.  He believed and taught that we are living in the time of the second presence of our Lord, and that His presence dates from 1874; that since that time we have been living in the &quot;time of the end&quot;--the &quot;end of the Age,&quot; during which the Lord has been conducting His great Harvest work; that, in harmony with the Lord's own statement, this Harvest work is separating true Christians designated as &quot;wheat,&quot; from merely professing Christians, designated as &quot;tares,&quot; and gathering the true saints into the Kingdom of the Lord. It is here interesting to note that Jesus said, &quot;Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over His Household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing!  Verily I say unto you that He shall make him ruler over all His goods.&quot;  Thousands of the readers of Pastor Russell's writings believe that he filled the office of &quot;that faithful and wise servant,&quot; and that his great work was giving to the Household of Faith meat in due season.  His modesty and humility precluded him from openly claiming this title, but he admitted as much in private conversation.  For a more detailed account of his work, reference is made to THE WATCH TOWER of June 1st, 1916.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1910 Pastor Russell visited Palestine and Russia. He there orally delivered lectures to thousands of orthodox Jews on the regathering of Jews to Palestine.  In 1911 he was one of a committee of seven who made a journey around the world and especially examined into the conditions of missionary work in Japan, China, Korea and India.  On the same occasion he again visited the Jews in Palestine and Galatia, explaining to them that the prophecies teach that the Jews at an early date will again be established in Palestine.  On his return to America he was given a great ovation at the New York City Hippodrome by thousands of Jews, his discourse on this occasion being published by Hebrew papers both in America and in Europe.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During the 42 years of Pastor Russell's Christian work he never directly or indirectly solicited money.  No collection was ever taken at any meeting addressed by him or by any of his associates.  He had faith that the Lord would supply sufficient money to carry on His work; that the work was the Lord's, and not man's.  The fact that voluntary contributions were liberally made by many persons throughout the world proved that his conclusions were correct.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He devoted his private fortune entirely to the cause to which he gave his life.  He received the nominal sum of $11.00 per month for his personal expenses.  He died, leaving no estate whatsoever.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus closed the career of a most remarkable man. He was loved most by those who knew him best.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Having at various times during past years donated to the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY all of my personal possessions except a small personal bank account of approximately two hundred dollars, in the Exchange National Bank of Pittsburgh, which will properly be paid over to my wife if she survives me, I have merely love and Christian good wishes to leave to all of the dear members of the Bible House Family--and all other dear colaborers in the Harvest work--yea, for all of the household of faith in every place who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus as their Redeemer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">However, in view of the fact that in donating the journal, ZION'S WATCH TOWER, the OLD THEOLOGY QUARTERLY and the copyrights of the MILLENNIAL DAWN SCRIPTURE STUDIES Books and various other booklets, hymn-books, etc., to the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY, I did so with the explicit understanding that I should have full control of all the interests of these publications during my life time, and that after my decease they should be conducted according to my wishes.  I now herewith set forth the said wishes--my will respecting the same--as follows:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AN EDITORIAL COMMITTEE OF FIVE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I direct that the entire editorial charge of ZION'S WATCH TOWER shall be in the hands of a committee of five brethren, whom I exhort to great carefulness and fidelity to the Truth. All articles appearing in the columns of ZION'S WATCH TOWER shall have the unqualified approval of at least three of the committee of five, and I urge that if any matter approved by three be known or supposed to be contrary to the views of one or both of the other members of the committee, such articles shall be held over for thought, prayer and discussion for three months before being published--that so far as possible the unity of the faith and the bonds of peace may be maintained in the Editorial management of the journal.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The names of the Editorial Committee (with such changes as may from time to time occur) shall all be published in each number of the journal--but it shall not in any manner be indicated by whom the various articles appearing in the journal are written.  It will be sufficient that the fact be recognized that the articles are approved by the majority of the committee.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the Society is already pledged to me that it will publish no other periodicals, it shall also be required that the Editorial Committee shall write for or be connected with no other publications in any manner or degree.  My object in these requirements is to safeguard the committee and the journal from any spirit of ambition or pride or headship, and that the Truth may be recognized and appreciated for its own worth, and that the Lord may more particularly be recognized as the Head of the Church and the Fountain of Truth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Copies of my Sunday discourses published in the daily newspapers covering a period of several years have been preserved and may be used as editorial matter for The WATCH TOWER or not, as the committee may think best, but my name shall not be attached nor any indication whatever given respecting the authorship.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those named below as members of the Editorial Committee (subject to their acceptance) are supposed by me to be thoroughly loyal to the doctrines of the Scriptures-- especially so to the doctrine of the Ransom--that there is no acceptance with God and no salvation to eternal life except through faith in Christ and obedience to His Word and its spirit.  If any of the designated ones shall at any time find themselves out of harmony with this provision they will be violating their consciences and hence committing sin if they continue to remain members of this Editorial Committee-- knowing that so to do would be contrary to the spirit and intention of this provision.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Editorial Committee is self-perpetuating, in that should one of these members die or resign, it will be the duty of the remainder to elect his successor, that the journal may never have an issue without a full Editorial Committee of five.  I enjoin upon the committee named great caution in respect to the election of others to their number--that purity of life, clearness in the Truth, zeal for God, love for the brethren and faithfulness to the Redeemer shall be prominent characteristics of the one elected.  In addition to the five named for the committee I have named five others from whom I prefer that selection should be made for any vacancies in the Editorial Committee, before going outside for a general selection--unless in the interim, between the making of this Will and the time of my death, something should occur which would seem to indicate these as less desirable or others more desirable for filling the vacancies mentioned. The names of the Editorial Committee are as follows:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                           WILLIAM E. PAGE,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                           WILLIAM E. VAN AMBURGH,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The names of the five whom I suggest as possibly amongst the most suitable from which to fill vacancies in the Editorial Committee are as follows:  A. E. Burgess, Robert Hirsh, Isaac Hoskins, Geo. H. Fisher (Scranton), J. F. Rutherford, Dr. John Edgar.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The following announcement shall appear in each issue of THE WATCH TOWER, followed by the names of the Editorial Committee:</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">     </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ZION'S WATCH TOWER EDITORIAL COMMITTEE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   This journal is published under the supervision of an Editorial Committee, at least three of whom must have read and have approved as TRUTH each and every article appearing in these columns.  The names of the Committee now serving are:  (names to follow.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As for compensation, I think it wise to maintain the Society's course of the past in respect to salaries--that none be paid; that merely reasonable expenses be allowed to those who serve the Society or its work in any manner.  In harmony with the course of the Society, I suggest that the provision for the Editorial Committee, or the three that shall be actively engaged, shall consist of not more than a provision for their food and shelter and ten dollars per month, with such a moderate allowance for wife or children or others dependent upon them for support as the Society's Board of Directors shall consider proper, just, reasonable-- that no provision be made for the laying up of money.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I desire that the OLD THEOLOGY QUARTERLY continue to appear as at present, so far as the opportunities for distribution and the laws of the land will permit, and that its issues shall consist of reprints from the old issues of THE WATCH TOWER or extracts from my discourses, but that no name shall appear in connection with the matter unless the same is required by law.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is my wish that the same rules apply to the German, the French, the Italian, the Danish and the Swedish or any other foreign publications controlled or supported by the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I will that a copy of this paper be sent to each one whose name has appeared above as of the Editorial Committee or the list from whom others of that committee may be chosen to fill vacancies and also to each member of the Board of Directors of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY. This shall be done immediately on my death being reported, so that within a week, if possible, the persons named as of the Editorial Committee may be heard from, their communications being addressed to the Vice-President of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY--whoever may be holding that office at that time.  The answers of those appointed shall be to the point, indicating their acceptance or rejection of the provisions and terms specified.  A reasonable time shall be allowed for any one mentioned who may be absent from the city or from the country.  Meantime the remainder of the committee of at least three shall proceed to act in their capacity as editors.  It shall be the duty of the officers of the Society to provide the necessary arrangements for these members of the Editorial Committee and to assist them in their duties in every possible manner, in compliance with the engagements made with me bearing on this matter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have already donated to the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY all my voting shares therein, putting the same in the hands of five Trustees, as follows:  Sr. E. Louise Hamilton, Sr. Almeta M. Nation Robison, Sr. J. G. Herr, Sr. C. Tomlins, Sr. Alice G. James.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R5999 : page 359::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   These Trustees shall serve for life.  In event of deaths or resignations successors shall be chosen by the WATCH TOWER SOCIETY Directors and Editorial Committee and the remaining Trustees after prayer for Divine guidance.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I now provide for the impeachment and dismissal from the Editorial Committee of any member thereof found to be unworthy the position by reason of either doctrinal or moral laches, as follows:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At least three of the Board must unite in bringing the impeachment charges, and the Board of Judgment in the matter shall consist of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY'S trustees and the five trustees controlling my voting shares and the Editorial Committee, excepting the accused. Of these sixteen members at least thirteen must favor the impeachment and dismissal in order to effect the same.</font><br />

M. Land, and her daughters, Alice and May, or such of them as may survive me, with the assistance and advice and cooperation of the brethren, as they may request the same.  Instead of an ordinary funeral discourse, I request that they arrange to have a number of the brethren, accustomed to public speaking, make a few remarks each, that the service be very simple and inexpensive and that it be conducted in the Bible House Chapel or any other place that may be considered equally appropriate or more so.</font><br />

The same I extend in a still broader sweep to all the family of the Lord in every place--especially to those rejoicing in the Harvest Truth.  I entreat you all that you continue to progress and to grow in grace, in knowledge, and above all in love, the great fruit of the Spirit in its various diversified forms.  I exhort to meekness, not only with the world, but with one another; to patience with one another and with all men, to gentleness with all, to brotherly kindness, to godliness, to purity.  I remind you that all these things are necessary for us, necessary that we may attain the promised Kingdom, and that the Apostle has assured us that if we do these things we shall never fail, but that &quot;so an entrance shall be ministered unto us abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">              </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE FUNERAL SERVICES</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The remains of Pastor Russell--announcement of whose death was published in the last issue of THE WATCH TOWER--arrived in New York from the West on Friday morning, November 3, accompanied by his traveling secretary, Menta Sturgeon.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the body reached Chicago, a large number of friends had assembled at the station, and as it was necessary to transfer the casket from one depot to another, a long procession of automobiles bearing the sorrowing friends formed and followed through the city.  The casket was opened during the delay here, and many took the last look at him whom they knew so well and loved so much.  From Chicago the body was accompanied by a delegation, delegations from other cities joining en route to New York.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The remains reached the Bethel Home on Saturday, where they were viewed by the Family and by members of the Congregation.  On Sunday morning they were removed to The Temple and lay in state until 10 o'clock in the evening.  Thousands saw them here for the last time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All day Saturday and Sunday representatives of congregations in many of the cities east of the Mississippi and in Canada arrived on almost every incoming train. The Temple was inadequate to accommodate them all. The lecture room below was opened for the overflow. Every inch of available space was occupied from the basement to and including the second balcony.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Two services had been announced for The Temple-- one to be held in the afternoon for the friends, the other for the public in the evening.  But in view of the rapidly increasing numbers, the Committee of Arrangements provided an additional service, to be held on Sunday morning. The speaker was Brother Macmillan, whose remarks will be found elsewhere.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The afternoon service, which had been especially announced for the friends, was opened with a solo, &quot;Be Thou Faithful Unto Death.&quot;  These words were especially impressive, because one of the most beautiful floral designs surrounding the casket bore a broad white ribbon on which were the words of this beautiful hymn.  The other hymns were 23, &quot;Blest be the tie that binds,&quot; so frequently used by the classes and by conventions when welcoming Brother Russell in their midst; and No. 273, &quot;Sun of my soul, my Father dear,&quot; one of Brother Russell's favorite hymns.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Each speaker, when he had completed his remarks at the side of the casket in the main Auditorium, proceeded to the lecture room below and repeated the same address to the friends crowding the smaller Auditorium. All of the addresses--seventeen in number--appear in this issue of THE WATCH TOWER.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">               </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE FLORAL DISPLAY</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Elsewhere in THE WATCH TOWER will be found a full-page view of the floral display on the rostrum.  It was the finest we have ever seen on such an occasion.  The scene surpassed description.  The rostrum of The Temple was so completely occupied by plants, ferns, flowers and a most wonderful collection of appropriate floral designs as to leave barely room enough for the speakers and the remains of our beloved Pastor.  Moreover, the entire facing of every balcony and box was artistically decorated with a great variety of ferns and flowers.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At the foot of the casket was placed a broken pillar of flowers, fittingly representing that dear body which, like the Lord's body, had been broken in the service of the brethren; while at the head was a magnificent floral cross and crown, the cross symbolizing his share in the death of Christ, and the crown symbolizing the Crown of Glory, which we believe he now wears with our dear Lord in Heaven.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The rostrum was not large enough to contain all the floral designs, nor was there space available in the interior of The Temple to display all the floral contributions. But however beautiful and numerous all these were, they</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6000 : page 360::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">but very imperfectly represented the degree of love and esteem in which our departed Pastor was held by all who knew him well.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Committee of Arrangements were of course desirous of following Brother Russell's suggestion in his Will, and to this end requested several brethren to speak at the services.  Among these were A.H. MacMillan, Menta Sturgeon, W.E. Van Amburgh, P.S.L. Johnson, E.W.V. Kuehn, Toledo, O.; C.A. Wise, Indianapolis, Ind.; J.T.D. Pyles, Washington, D.C.; I.I. Margeson, Boston, Mass.; F.W. Manton, Toronto, Canada; C.B. Shull, Columbus, Ohio; G.C. Driscoll, Dayton, Ohio; Dr. L.W. Jones, Chicago, Ill.; D. Kihlgren, Springfield, Mass.; Dr. A.E. McCosh, Detroit, Mich.; C.J. Woodworth, Scranton, Pa.; George Draper, Wichita, Kansas; C.H. Anderson, Baltimore, Md.; W.L. Abbott, St. Paul, Minn.; and J.D. Ross, Truro, N.S.  But to have carried out the program in its entirety would have consumed considerable more time, and as The Temple was so crowded that many were obliged to stand for hours, it was deemed wise to reduce the number of speakers.  The addresses of those at the three services follow in regular order:</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ADDRESS AT MORNING SERVICE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">           BY A. H. MACMILLAN--NEW YORK</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I am satisfied that I am expressing the sentiments of all present when I say that if the English language contains words capable of describing our feelings at the present time, we have not learned them yet.  We are happy and sad, confused and perplexed; yet the way is clear--and we are glad!  Death invariably causes a gloom wherever its clammy hand appears; yet, as the Apostle Paul expresses it, &quot;We sorrow not as those that have no hope.&quot;  Our glorious hope buoys us up in this trial hour, and we are happy because we know our Beloved Pastor is even now with the Lord.  Numerous questions crowd themselves into our minds: We wonder if the work will continue in the future as it has in the past; whether the waters of Jordan will be &quot;smitten&quot;; who will write the Seventh Volume; to whom shall we go with our perplexing trials and difficulties as individuals and as ecclesias?  It is my purpose to attempt to answer briefly some of these questions by relating to you the arrangements made by our dear Pastor before his death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Following the Newport Convention in July, Brother Russell had a serious sick spell, during which illness he called me to the Study and spent three and a half hours outlining the work that he felt was yet to be done, and endeavoring to make plans to carry it on.  He asked me then if I would</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6001 : page 360::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">like to come back to Brooklyn and help in the work of the Home and Tabernacle.  I gave him my reply later, offering my services to do what I could to help him and the other friends there.  He told me at that time that he realized his strength was rapidly ebbing away and that he would not be with us much longer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From that time on it seemed to be Brother Russell's purpose to place much more responsibility on the heads of the various departments in the Tabernacle and Bethel work.  Just before he departed upon his last trip he did something he was never known to do before; viz., to write letters to the different friends in charge of the various departments of the work, outlining their duties to them.  Upon his departure he asked me to ride with him in the taxi to the depot.  On this ride he affectionately placed his hand on my knee and said, &quot;What do you think of those letters I have written?&quot;  I replied that I considered superhuman wisdom directed him in writing them and that to my understanding the organization for the work here was complete. He said, &quot;I am glad, Brother; for no one can work without an organization.  Now that you have my plans before you, proceed and do your best.&quot;  Later on he wrote a letter home numbering the tables in the dining room, and designating who would serve at the head of each table.  Thus you see that everything that he thought could be done to organize matters, to the end that they might run smoothly, was done.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Respecting the continuance of THE WATCH TOWER: An Editorial Staff of five brethren has been appointed, and sufficient matter prepared to last for an indefinite period, so that we can continue to read the Lord's message through our Pastor as published in THE WATCH TOWER, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">even though</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he is not present with us in the flesh.  It appears clear now that the Lord left our Beloved Pastor with us to the end that he might, as did St. Paul in his day, &quot;bear the Church in birth until Christ would be formed&quot; in us; and now that we should be able to stand without an earthly leader, the Lord has removed the faithful one He placed over us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The work before us is great, but the Lord will give us the necessary grace and strength to perform it.  The Prophet Zechariah clearly indicated this course when he said that the Lord would smite the man that was His fellow, even as He smote the Shepherd.  As Jesus quoted a portion of this text and applied it to His own experiences, we believe the remainder of the text is being fulfilled now.  When Jesus, the Shepherd, was smitten, the sheep were scattered abroad and were rent, torn and greatly perplexed until they were gathered at Pentecost and endued with power to go on with the work.  We notice in this connection, however, that following the smiting of the Lord's &quot;fellow,&quot; there would be no scattering of the sheep, but the reverse--the &quot;Hand&quot; or power of the great Jehovah God would rest upon the little ones left over.--`Zech. 13:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And now, dear friends, what are we to think about this matter?  The Lord has taken away our earthly leader; and some faint-hearted workers may think the time has come to lay down our harvesting instruments and wait until the Lord calls us home.  This is not the time for slackers to be heard.  This is a time for action--more determined action than ever before!  Let us, by God's grace, resolve that we will take up the work where our Beloved Pastor left it, and with determined purpose keep high aloft the banner of Truth, until the waters of Jordan have been smitten and divided asunder, and the last member of the Elijah class has been taken to Heavenly glory.  May the Lord help us all as we endeavor to serve Him!</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">PASTOR RUSSELL'S LAST DAYS--BY MENTA STURGEON--NEW YORK</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   On Monday afternoon, October 16th, at five o'clock, Brother Russell left the Bethel Home for the last time. At the noon hour he informed the dearest family (to him) on earth that he expected to be absent from them for a short time, and expressed for them the hope that during his absence they might be happy and prosperous under the blessings of the Lord.  He also said that he expected that he and the one accompanying him would enjoy themselves in the Lord's service.  Then, while he and the family stood at their places, he offered a solemn prayer, beginning with the words:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;O Lord, Thy promised grace impart,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     And fill each consecrated heart!&quot; and quietly withdrew to his Study.  There he dictated nine letters, giving instructions to various ones respecting their duties.  At the appointed hour he went forth, never more to return, saying &quot;goodby&quot; to the friends in the hall as he passed out and started for the station.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the Lehigh Valley train pulled out of Jersey City at six o'clock p. m., it carried away our precious Brother on his last pilgrim journey, which was to end in Heaven. Having held public meetings at Providence and Fall River the day previous, he was tired to start with, and consequently did not dictate on the train that evening, as was his custom.  In fact, he retired earlier than usual, saying &quot;Good-night&quot; as he did so.  In the morning, in answer to the question as to how he rested, he gave his usual answer</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6001 : page 361::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">during his recent trips, &quot;On both sides,&quot; meaning, of course, that he changed sides frequently during the night.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He often told us of late that he scarcely slept at all, was awake every hour of the night, and thought pretty much day and night.  He had the care of all the churches upon his heart, and his physical ailments would not permit much rest.  He always ate sparingly, and would carefully note the effect of everything he ate or drank.  Frequently would he divide his portion with his companion, in order to economize.  It was his invariable custom to return thanks before all meals, whether in hotels, on trains, or where not. He had a beautiful way of making the one who traveled with him feel at ease, and not consider himself merely as a servant, by handing him enough money at the beginning of the journey to cover all his incidental expenses during the trip.  He would then arrange that we pay each other's expenses alternately; he paying all expenses for both one day, and his companion paying all expenses for both the next day, and so on during the entire trip.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On Tuesday morning we passed over the line into Canada; and he wittily inquired, &quot;Did you not feel the bridge bulge in the center as we crossed over?&quot;  Respecting Canada he said, &quot;They will not molest us so long as we are just passing through; and as to visiting Canada, I have no desire to do so if they do not want me.&quot;  On two previous occasions he had had severe trials in Hamilton, Ontario; but on this occasion he did not even recognize Hamilton as we passed through.  We changed trains, and also our watches, at London; and ere long made our first stop, Detroit, on Tuesday afternoon.  It was at this point that Brother Russell's trials began; and they grew steadily deeper and severer until the end of the way.  He was physically weak and weary, yet listened patiently to a brother's grievances as he recited them, and then did what he could to reconcile two brethren.  The chauffeur took us to the wrong place and consumed valuable time.  Our street car connections were poorly made.  A matter of the greatest importance in connection with the Harvest work fell flat.  He was much disappointed and perplexed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">            </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">DIFFICULTIES ON THE WAY</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Aboard the Pere Marquette en route for Lansing, Mich., he remarked, &quot;We did not expect that we would be traveling together to Lansing when first we met&quot;; and the listener was surprised to find that he well remembered our first meeting together years ago, in Allegheny.  This was his way of showing his interest in and love for the one whom he had taken with him from Bethel to accompany him on this last journey.  The public meeting at Lansing was well attended; but, for some reason, the interest waned and many left; so much so, that Brother Russell spoke of it afterwards, and seemed puzzled.  At the railroad station he conversed with a dear brother on business matters until midnight, when he remarked that he would have to retire.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The next morning, Wednesday, at seven o'clock we expected to be in Chicago, but found ourselves instead side-tracked at Kalamazoo, without any reliable information as to what to expect.  The wreckage of a freight train during the night had caused the delay, we were informed, and a detour of fifty miles would be necessary to enable us to reach our destination.  There was no dining car on the train, and neither could we secure anything to eat on account of uncertainties. It was at this point that a box of peanut butter sandwiches, which had been given to us by a thoughtful friend in Brooklyn, came in just right.  It made our breakfast, and afterwards our lunch.  Reaching Chicago some six and a half hours late, we found that we had missed our connections for Springfield and would consequently be unable to make the appointment for that place, even though we figured every possible way.  It was at Chicago that his physical endurance was taxed to the limit.  Circumstances made it necessary for us to walk several miles, until the writer was growing weary and was sure that Brother Russell must be worn out also, although no remarks of the kind passed between us.  All of this occurred after a few hours' rest during the previous night and with but little to eat.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was in the Union Station at Chicago, while making preparations for leaving on the Wednesday evening train</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6002 : page 361::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">for Kansas City via Springfield, that a lady from the South, who had been visiting with her daughter and her son in Chicago for some time, came up to Brother Russell, introduced herself as the daughter of a certain lady who had formerly lived in Allegheny, who was a believer in the Truth, and whose funeral Brother Russell had conducted. She explained that, while she was not &quot;one of us&quot; in the fullest sense, yet she believed, and was especially interested in the PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION--so much so that she was writing a book on it, calling it The Golden Age; and she desired to have a copy of the SCENARIO.  This SCENARIO was both promised and sent.  Brother Russell, as usual, inquired respecting the consecration of herself and daughter, and they expressed themselves as seriously considering the matter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How many times have I heard him ask people on the trains, in the stations, hotels, everywhere, &quot;Are you consecrated?&quot; He nearly always brought this in.  He had many opportunities; for people recognized him everywhere and desired to speak or have a few words with him.  People on the train knew him--brakemen, porters, conductors and passengers. In the stations, hotels, on the streets, everywhere, he was recognized.  Many a time people came to me on the train and inquired, &quot;Is that not Pastor Russell? and would say, &quot;I knew him by his picture in the paper,&quot; or &quot;I heard him lecture at such and such a place.&quot;  Sometimes they would inquire just after he had walked through the train, &quot;Who is that distinguished gentleman with you?&quot;  In this way we were able to send out many First Volumes and other printed matter of the Society.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">        </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LOSS OF BROTHER RUSSELL'S VALISE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   It was toward midnight when we reached Springfield, where tickets would have to be procured.  Brother Russell sat up late and intended to stay up until we reached Springfield; but, responding to gentle persuasion, he left the matters to be attended to in my hands, and retired.  It was a rainy, cold night; but still there were faithful friends waiting at the station in order to give him his mail and have a few words with him.  They were satisfied when we explained the conditions to them, gave the writer Brother Russell's mail and sent much Christian love to him, which he much appreciated.  The brother who substituted for Brother Russell at Springfield said that the friends had encountered less objection in preparing for the public lecture than at any previous time; and he attributed this to the good and thorough work done on a previous visit, when Brother Russell spoke at the State Fair.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At Kansas City on Thursday morning we encountered so many difficulties in purchasing tickets for the West that it became necessary that I make a trip up into the city through the rain, and with such delay that Brother Russell did here what we had never before known him to do; viz., run to catch a train.  We are saying these things to show how different this trip was from anything that had ever preceded it, and how his trials increased as he proceeded on his journey.  We reached Wichita Thursday afternoon in time for an afternoon meeting; but it, with other work in Wichita, was more or less interfered with by the loss of Brother Russell's valise.  The dear brother who took it in charge, in getting his auto ready, placed the valise on the foot-board, and in starting off, forgot to take it in with him, with the result that it fell off somewhere between the station and the place of meeting.  This caused the writer to leave off taking notes of the discourse, and go back with the brother in an effort to locate the lost article.  We did everything we could, to no avail, and finally inserted a notice in the newspaper offering a reward to anyone who would return the grip.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We remained over the next day in the hope of getting it, and in the meantime made some necessary purchases of articles that Brother Russell would need on the journey. The public meeting was held at night, after which he was quite tired.  The next morning he was later than usual in coming from his room; but after breakfast we worked together until noon on some documents and letters that he had previously dictated.  It was here that a traveling salesman of fine appearance introduced himself to Brother</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6002 : page 362::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Russell as interested in his writings.  He proved to be the son of a prominent minister in Allegheny who, at one time, bitterly opposed Brother Russell and the work he was doing.  This gentleman's wife was also interested; and we afterwards met her at the public meeting in Dallas, Texas.  Having done everything we could to locate the missing valise, we finally gave up the search, and were shortly on the train en route for the Dallas Convention.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">             </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">EXPERIENCES AT DALLAS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   As we arrived at Fort Worth at an early hour, it was not convenient for the friends to meet us, and we took the Electric for Dallas.  The State Fair at Dallas was in progress, and every hotel was crowded.  On account of Brother Russell's physical condition we were obliged to leave the car before reaching Dallas; so that when we came in by foot, after walking some seven blocks through crowded streets, all connections with the brethren were broken.  After some difficulty they found us.  The hotels were all over-crowded; we were consequently taken to a private rooming house, where several of the brethren attending the Convention were located.  There we remained Saturday and Sunday, until our departure for his next appointment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Brother Russell closed the Dallas Convention with a Love Feast and was much impressed with the earnestness and evident sincerity of the friends there.  That night he spoke to the public for two and a half hours, during the course of which talk there was no little confusion on the rear of the stage by the coming and going of a theatrical troupe that was to play in the theater that night.  One of the members of this troop recognized Pastor Russell as the speaker and asked permission to join in the closing song.  He had a strong, mellow voice, and joined heartily in singing, &quot;All hail the power of Jesus' name!&quot;  After a little rest at the nearest hotel, several of us walked to the station, and there had to work our way slowly through the jam as best we could, it taking us fully a half-hour to reach our train after arriving at the station.  Boarding the train at Dallas that night, October 22d, Brother Russell was tired, and his head was aching.  Some medicine was taken, and he retired.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon arriving in Galveston the next morning, he was not well by any means; but the brethren having arranged for a morning meeting, he consented to speak to the friends at 11:30, following a discourse by Brother Sturgeon.  It was at this meeting that he did something we never knew him to do before.  He wrote on a piece of paper his text and one verse of a song, and told the friends that he had done so that he might make no mistake.  This paper is now before us and reads:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;WHEN YE SEE THESE THINGS begin to come to pass, then lift up your heads and rejoice, knowing that your deliverance draweth nigh.&quot;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;Then let our songs abound,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     And every tear be dry;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     We're traveling through Immanuel's ground,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     To fairer prospects nigh.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">BROTHER RUSSELL'S LAST MEAL</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   This discourse was taken down, and will be printed in due time.  The last letters Brother Russell dictated were just before going to this meeting.  After it was over the brethren gave him a drive down the Sea Wall Boulevard; and he seemed to enjoy the balmy sea breeze and the beautiful, rolling waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  During the little outing on the Boulevard, a dear brother laid before Brother Russell his troubles and received advice.  There were nine brethren who took dinner with us that day at the Hotel Galvez; and he answered their questions, and seemed to enjoy the fellowship and the meal.  This proved to be the last meal that Brother Russell ate.  Hereafter it was to be a little fruit juice, a swallow or two of a soft-boiled egg, or something like that.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We were presently off for the public meeting in Galveston, which was held in a capacious, beautiful auditorium; but, it being Monday afternoon, not more than 500 were present.  However, he had to work just as hard, and even harder, and was very tired at the close.  Going by auto to the Post Office and then to the train, the friends were there to talk and ask questions until time for leaving, he, in the meantime, eating nothing.  At 7:45 we were at Houston, and there were eager, earnest friends waiting for him, who accompanied him to a well-filled auditorium containing some 1,200 people, to whom he spoke for about two and a half hours, making a total of six hours talking on Monday, Oct. 23d.  Was he tired?  Was he worn and weary?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Traveling all night then and reaching the home of Sister Frost Tuesday morning, it was not surprising to find him in much physical pain.  His labors were telling on him more than ever.  His overworked body began to break at its weakest point.  Cystitis was becoming acute.  We secured various things for him that morning--in fact, everything he wished, and he seemed to know exactly what to get and do.  He worked faithfully on his case all morning; and although we had gone to see a doctor who was somewhat interested in the Truth and who would gladly have called to see him, yet it was not his wish.  He appreciated the kind offer, but indicated that he would not need a physician's services. He had himself the best knowledge of the case to be had, was most skilful in its treatment, and had a servant at hand who would do readily and gladly anything he desired. This was all he wished.  The choicest of fruit was placed just outside his door, but he did not touch it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6003 : page 362::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Conditions were getting serious.  Brother Russell signed a few letters we had written, gave us to understand that we were doing a more important work than we realized and then had us substitute for him at the 11 o'clock meeting at the Hall.  Sister Frost generously placed her auto at our disposal, so that we could easily and quickly go to and fro. He went to dinner with us, talked pleasantly to everyone, and was as humorous as usual; but he ate nothing, although the dinner was excellent.  After the meal we went upstairs together arm in arm to his room; and after talking for awhile, he asked us to take the consecration service at the Hall at 3 o'clock.  This we did and returned immediately to his room.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I then went to every telegraph office in town in search for a telegram which he felt sure would be here from Chicago, since we had not received it at Dallas.  His valise had, however, been received at Dallas.  A little girl, having found it in Wichita, had held it until she learned what to do with it, through the notice we had inserted in the newspaper. She received her reward, and was glad.  Brother Russell was disappointed again and again at not receiving certain telegrams.  Returning, we remained close to him the rest of the day, and in fact, was very close to him for the next week.  One week thence he would be in glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HIS LAST PUBLIC DISCOURSE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The night was drawing on.  I was seated on the low window sill close by his side, my hands rested upon his knee and my face was turned up toward his.  Love like electricity was flowing from face to face and heart to heart. We talked in whispered tones; and he said during the quiet, lovely conversation, &quot;Dear brother, please remain close tonight and be ready to pick up the thread of thought where I drop it.&quot;  All this seemed very unusual, and yet was spoken in such a way as not to be disquieting.  His companion was being deeply impressed, and watched his face, eyes and words as with an under-sight.  He was meditative. He was responsive without saying a word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The evening lecture was given in the largest and best theater in San Antonio.  It is indeed a beautiful structure. The dress circle below and the three balconies above were filled with earnest, intelligent faces.  We have never seen a meeting more beautiful.  The lecture on the subject of &quot;The World on Fire&quot; was begun under the most favorable conditions. You can picture it at your best, and you will not miss it far.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When all was in readiness at 8:10, Brother Russell stepped to the front of the platform and began his last public discourse. The scene was most beautiful and impressive.  I was seated at his right, behind the screen, and could see every motion he made.  All went well for about forty-five minutes, when I thought I could see that he was going to leave the platform.  Without any sign of suffering, with perfect self-poise, quietly did he walk off the rostrum, while I endeavored</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6003 : page 363::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">to walk on just as orderly and quietly, and, without a word of explanation, &quot;picked up the thread where he had dropped it.&quot;  I continued for about five minutes, when he returned, at which time it became my privilege to retire as quietly as did he, and resume my seat behind the curtain.  My eyes were riveted upon him for another half hour, when he left again and I came on, endeavoring to clinch what he had taught them by the use of Elijah as a type.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He returned the second time, after an absence of seven minutes, and proceeded with his discourse.  He was telling the audience about the formation of the first creed at Nicaea, by the Bishops under the direction of the Roman Emperor Constantine, when he left again.  The thread of history was easily gathered up and carried forward for about ten minutes, when the thought began to run through my mind, &quot;I wonder if he wishes me to close the discourse?&quot; Then in our dear teacher came, just in time to bring the whole discourse to a fitting close.  It was a wonderful climax to all his public lectures.  He seemed to me to stand in a halo of glory.  Leading the great audience in singing, &quot;All hail the power of Jesus' name,&quot; he prayed most impressively, and found me waiting for him as he came from the platform. He sat in the chair which I had been using; and while resting, a friend took several kodak pictures of him. They being the last, we hope they may be the best.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">             </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">EN ROUTE TO CALIFORNIA</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We were escorted to the train by the one who had entertained us in her home and supplied our every need, of whom it may be truly said, &quot;She hath done what she could.&quot; She said that she was glad to break the alabaster box, and handed me money enough to secure a Pullman drawing-room from San Antonio to our western destination.  Brother Russell at first refused this, thinking it was too much, but was afterwards induced to accept the kind offer, and well he did; for that night he was up thirty-six times in seven hours!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was just after leaving San Antonio that I had the privilege and pleasure of untying and removing his shoes for the first time.  Hitherto he would not permit this, although I had several times made the offer; but now he acquiesced readily, and said, in his gracious manner, &quot;Thank you!&quot;  The next morning he was a sick man, although he was not ready to admit it.  He kept to his bed all day Wednesday.  While he lay there in his berth, I took a seat on the couch, near him.  I watched every move he made, stroked his head, and thought what a stupendous amount of work that brain had done!  Taking his soft, gentle right hand and letting it rest in the palm of my left hand, I gently stroked it with my right; and thinking of his lecture at San Antonio the previous night and of the many times I had seen him use that hand so graciously when exposing the errors of the creeds of men as contrasted with the Word of God, I said to him, &quot;That is the greatest creed-smashing hand I ever saw!&quot;  He replied that he did not think it would smash any more creeds.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This led me to inquire, &quot;Who will smite the River Jordan?&quot;  To this he responded, &quot;Some one else can do that.&quot; &quot;But how about the payment of the penny?&quot; I asked.  He hesitated for a moment and said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  Brother Russell was evidently perplexed.  We then talked about his physical condition.  What he said about his sufferings was this: &quot;I always thought I should have some severe sufferings before I finished my course, but thought when I had the trouble in Pittsburgh, that was it.  But if the Lord wants to add this also, it is all right.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During the course of this conversation he said, &quot;What shall we do?&quot;  Prayerfully considering the matter, I said, &quot;Well, Brother Russell, you seem to know your case better than anyone else could know, and you have thought of everything that can be done.  Have I done everything that you can think of that I ought to do?&quot;  His answer will never be forgotten.  His words were laden with comfort ocean-deep, when in a still, small voice he said, &quot;Yes, you have; I do not know what I would do without you.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Every move he made and every word he uttered only made me think the deeper, and yet I could hardly think of Brother Russell's life coming to a close.  My thought was his thought, and the thought of all the friends, that he would probably be here until the last, and would be translated after the work is over.  Having this in mind, I answered his question by saying, &quot;Since we have done everything we know, and you are getting weaker all the time--your vitality is being drained while you are eating nothing to replenish it--I think that if we return to Brooklyn, you will find something there that will put you on your feet again.&quot; His reply to this suggestion was, &quot;The Lord permitted us to make out this route.&quot;  From this I inferred that he meant: The route that we had laid out, and according to which our whole schedule had been arranged, represented the will of the Lord for us; and we must therefore do our utmost in carrying it out.  The writer's original thought about this route was, that after Brother Russell had had such a heavy, strenuous summer season on account of the many Conventions attended, it would be better to take the Mallory Line Steamer at New York and go all the way to Galveston by water; but his objection was that it was too round-about and would take too much time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">              </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">DETAINED AT DEL RIO</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We were moving rapidly through southern Texas on the Southern Pacific and were approaching Del Rio when we learned that a bridge ahead of us had been burned during the night and that we would likely be held up for some time.  Our train halted at Del Rio; and we found ourselves in the midst of an encampment of border soldiers. The soldiers were marching through the streets, the bands were playing, and much noise was made in every direction. In addition to this, three train loads of troopers were pulled in on the siding near us; and these men, not being permitted to leave the trains, were continually yelling and engaging in all kinds of frivolities and jokes.  This continued all through that day and night.  Besides, the weather was hot down there.  But never one word of complaint did Brother Russell make.  He did not even make mention of the soldiers and the noise.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Del Rio being a town of some 10,000 inhabitants, we were able to get a few needful things there.  At one time we suggested to Brother Russell that he let us go up into the town--get the leading doctor, and ascertain his idea of what would be the best thing to do in a case similar to his without letting him know for whom we were seeking the information; but this did not appeal to him to be the proper thing. The steward on the dining car knew Brother Russell, came in to see him, showed us many kindnesses, and offered to do anything he could.  The diner was three Pullmans ahead</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6004 : page 363::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of us.  Consequently we had to walk that distance for every little thing needed.  After one full day's delay we pulled out of Del Rio on Thursday morning, and were the first ones to pass over the rebuilt bridge.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When our train began to go over the bridge, we hastened in to tell Brother Russell.  We reached the drawing-room just as our car had come to the middle of the bridge.  Upon our mentioning it to him, he sat up in bed and looked out the window.  By that time we were over, whereupon we remarked, &quot;Brother Russell, we have often heard you speak about the time when we shall pass over the river; and now, at last, we are over.&quot;  A sweet smile came over his face, but he said not a word.  We began to think that he might pass over, but surely not very soon.  It was October, and it occurred to us that as we were delayed one day before passing over the river in southern Texas, so he might tarry with us one prophetic day and pass over by October, 1917. With these thoughts running through our mind, we were doing our best to serve our dear, patient, uncomplaining, appreciative Brother Russell in every way we could.  It was difficult to give him a drink of water without spilling it except we first raised him.  There was plenty to do night and day, and we esteemed it a great privilege.  We often thought to be all the more faithful because of the dear friends at home.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On Friday night, when we reached a junction point in California where we had to change trains, Brother Russell arose and dressed as usual, although, of course, he was</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6004 : page 364::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">very weak.  This is just what we thought he would do when it came time for his next meeting; for he had often done so before.  All day Saturday, under severe pain, in great weakness, with obstructions piling up before him every moment, he struggled with business propositions like a giant. We have never seen or heard of anything to equal his heroism. Friends had disappointed him, and he wondered if the Lord were not against him in some things.  His trials thickened and deepened.  Not a murmur or complaint did he utter. He had promised the Lord that he would not, and he kept his promise.  He was so great that I nearly always hesitated about drawing near to him.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">               </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ON TO LOS ANGELES</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Our train was an hour or more late in arriving in Los Angeles on Sunday morning, October 29th, and we had had nothing to eat.  The brethren were rejoiced to see us, but their countenances changed when they saw our dear Brother Russell.  They saw that he was weak, but they knew not how sick he was.  Besides, he would not yet admit that he was really sick.  By ten o'clock we had reached the hotel, and I asked him if I could not get him something to eat.  He said he was not hungry and asked me to suggest something. This I did.  He consented to my getting something, but only tasted a little of it.  Upon bringing it to him, he asked if I had had my breakfast; and when I answered, no, he wanted to know why.  I told him that it was because I wanted him to have his first.  He said he would not eat his until I had first had my breakfast.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This was just like Brother Russell.  He was always so considerate of others.  Whenever he would ask me to do anything for him, he would say &quot;Please&quot;; and when it was done he would invariably say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  He was a wonder!  Brother Homer Lee did what he could for Brother Russell while we were there and, upon our departure, gave me his best remedies, and hoped they would do him good. The brethren in Los Angeles were kind in every way.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">BROTHER RUSSELL'S LAST ADDRESS TO THE CHURCH</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   When the time came for the meeting with the friends in the afternoon, Brother Russell arose and made ready to go, the brethren having come for him in their auto.  It was 4:30 Sunday afternoon when we left the hotel for the meeting, which was held in the same auditorium in which the Los Angeles Convention was held during the first part of September.  It is a quiet and suitable hall.  We do not know of any better or more appropriate place in which Brother Russell could have given his last message to the Church.  He cautioned the brethren against exposing his physical condition by saying, &quot;Don't give me away, Brethren.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You know that our dear Brother was so considerate of the feelings of others that he never drew much on the sympathy of the friends--so considerate was he, that but few knew that he had been a physical sufferer for thirty years.  On one occasion recently he sent word to the Bethel Family that he would not be down to breakfast; and afterwards he told me that it was on account of the family that he did not come--that they had such deep sympathy for him that he did not like to draw on their vitality.  He had learned to lean on the Strong Arm alone!  He did not need us particularly, but we needed him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We were on the alert to comply with his every wish; and therefore no one called attention to his condition, and in that sense did not &quot;give him away.&quot;  However, he gave himself away.  To a keen observer his very presence spoke volumes.  But more than that, when he stepped to the front of the platform to begin to speak, out of consideration for the splendid audience before him (for every seat was occupied) he said, &quot;I regret that I am not able to speak with force or power,&quot; and then beckoned to the Chairman to remove the stand and bring a chair.  As he sat down, he said, &quot;Pardon me for sitting down, please.&quot;  In deep humility, in great suffering and in the most solemn manner, he spoke for about forty-five minutes, and then answered questions for a short period.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally he said, &quot;I must say goodby to you all, and give you a text for your remembrance--`Numbers 6:24-26`: 'The Lord bless thee and keep thee; the Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.'  May the Lord's blessing be with you richly; He has blessed the Los Angeles Class a great deal.  Each one should desire to do his own share.  No matter what others may do, each one do his share.  Now sing Number One:</font><br />
<br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;'Abide, sweet Spirit, Heavenly Dove,</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With light and comfort from Above;</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be Thou our guardian, Thou our Guide,</font></tt><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESERVE THIS SPIRIT IN YOUR MIDST</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Continuing, he said, &quot;Isn't this a beautiful thought?  Preserve this spirit in your midst.  Have perfect confidence in the Lord, and you will be led aright.  We were not brought into the Truth by any human catch-word, but by the Word of the Lord.  We know that the Lord will bring out everything all right.  I bid you all good by.&quot;  Thus, at 6:05 p. m. Sunday, October 29th, when he left that platform, he had delivered his last address to the Church on this side of the veil, forever.  Our hearts are bowed low!  We humbly worship God, our Heavenly Father, at the feet of Jesus.  We would prefer to keep silent; but for the Church's sake we will proceed:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Several tried to speak to Brother Russell in the auto as we rode away, but they were too late.  We were presently at the station; and when we stepped out, we left one behind.  It was the privilege of Brother Sherman to be with us at the station and to do us many kindnesses.  When Brother Russell signed his name to the railroad ticket at Kansas City, it was his last.  It was now our privilege to sign his name for him.  We went to the train while Brother Sherman went to the nearest drug store to make a purchase for him.  He returned at 6:30 and we said goodby. Santa Fe train No. 10 pulled out; we entered the drawing-room of car Roseisle; and in shutting to and locking the door, we shut him in and shut others out forever.  Thenceforth Gethsemane!  Victory!  Glory!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">            </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE RETURN JOURNEY BEGUN</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   He had me place various articles that he would need during the night in convenient places--under the covers, under his pillows, on the window-sills, so that he could reach them without disturbing me.  We did everything just as he directed, were glad to do so, and told him so.  He said, &quot;Thank you; I have you do some things because you are so willing.&quot; It was my pleasure to be the nurse while he was both physician and patient; and when the patient--how true the name!--no longer needed the services of either the physician or the nurse, the nurse became the undertaker and did those last sad and solemn rites which he had seen others do before.  I was careful to inquire, &quot;Is everything all right, Brother Russell?&quot;  He assured me that it was, thanked me, asked me to take my rest, indicated how he would call in case he needed me, bade me good night, and turned on his left side with his face toward the window.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We do not know how long it was afterwards when we were aroused from slumber by his knocking and calling us by name--it was probably a couple of hours.  But we went to him quickly, did what was required, heard him say again &quot;Thank you,&quot; and again lay down.  This time, however, we did so with the thought that we would not sleep so soundly. In another hour he knocked and called again; and we were at his side, and soon discovered that another chill was coming on.  He had had his first one two nights before.  We put five Pullman blankets upon him and tucked them in close on every side; but still he shook.  We gave him what was required, and was glad when the rigors ceased.  We remained by his side, lying down at times on the couch beside him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">             </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PREPARATIONS FOR DEATH</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Toward morning he had me make a robe for convenience sake by pinning a sheet inside of a blanket, wrapping him in it like a robe and fastening it under his chin.  He stood up on the floor for this purpose, and then lay down on the couch instead of returning to his berth.  I therefore sat on his bed while he lay before me.  After several hours his robe proved to be rather inconvenient, because the sheet</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6005 : page 365::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and blanket could not be kept together.  It was then that he stood again and said, &quot;Please make me a Roman toga.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I did not understand what he meant, but did not like to have him repeat, because he was so weak.  His voice had become so weak that he had to repeat nearly everything he said. I had said to him at several times, &quot;Dear Brother Russell, I do not like to ask you to repeat anything (It had always been my custom to listen to him so closely in all his dictation as not to require any repetition); but your voice is so weak that one can scarcely hear you.&quot;  He would always repeat until at last the repetition would do no good, after which he made signs.  Finally the signs failed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I said, &quot;Brother Russell, I do not understand what you mean.&quot;  He said, &quot;I will show you.&quot;  He had me take a clean sheet and turn it down twelve inches from the top; and then a second one the same.  Placing his left hand on his right shoulder, he said, &quot;Fasten them together here.&quot;  Having in my pocket a paper of safety-pins which I had recently purchased, it was easy for me to hold the sheets together on his right shoulder and at the same time reach into my pocket and get a safety-pin.  The sheets being fastened with the pin, as he had directed, he said, &quot;Now fasten them together on the other shoulder.&quot;  This I did.  There he stood, one sheet extending from his neck to his feet in front and the other in the back, fastened together on his two shoulders, and folded together at the edges.  He stood erect before me for a moment without saying a word, then lay down on the couch on his back, closed his eyes, and lay there before me as in a shroud, a perfect picture of death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I sat on the side of the bed watching him, beholding him, and the thought of death went through my mind.  It was difficult for me to get the thought into my head that Brother Russell was going to die.  I could not exactly believe it, even now.  It all seemed so foreign to what we had expected.  However, I know now that the Lord was gradually teaching us both from the time we had left San Antonio until now that Brother Russell's end was drawing on apace.  How much Brother Russell may have understood or meant by these movements we may not surely know.  They were at least the wisest things that could be done in his case; but to us they mean far more, and we believe that the Lord so arranged.  The toga was worn by Roman officials and sometimes by priests, and sometimes symbolized victory and peace, and at other times that the one wearing it had fulfilled his vows.  To the writer's mind all these things are meant.  He had fulfilled his vows! he had gained the victory! he was at peace!  Thenceforth there was laid up for him a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord would shortly place upon his noble brow.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CONCERNING THE SEVENTH VOLUME</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   With those scenes before me and with thoughts of the end running through my mind, it was only natural for me to say to myself, Had you not better ask Brother Russell concerning some things?  It was in this mood and in this connection that we inquired respecting the Seventh Volume, and received his answer, &quot;Some one else can write that.&quot; We were satisfied.  He had spoken concerning the smiting of the Jordan, the payment of the Penny and the writing of the Seventh Volume; and this was enough.  There was nothing left to doubt or fear.  We believe that he said everything that he desired to say, and that the Lord gave through him all that He wished the Church to have respecting these great, vital and important matters.  Brother Russell seemed to have no desire, neither did there seem to be any need, to say and do a lot of little things at the close of his life that had been left undone.  He had finished his course.  His labors were o'er.  He was ready to be offered.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We were solemnly busy throughout the day (Monday), so much so that we had no time for either dinner or supper. When night drew on, he was in his berth; and I lay down on the couch, with clothes on, to rest awhile.  I was just about to sink into sleep when I thought I heard the words, &quot;Brother Sturgeon.&quot;  As I came to, the experiences of Samuel came into my mind.  I leaned over him and said, &quot;Brother Russell, did you call me?&quot;  He answered &quot;Yes,&quot; and gave me some little thing to do, after which I lay down the second time.  Ere long I thought I heard my name called again.  I inquired as before, bent over close to him and heard him whisper, &quot;I am trying to find something for you to do.&quot;  From this I inferred, &quot;Brother Russell wants me to stay awake tonight&quot;; and it proved to be even so.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">               </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">DEATH DRAWING NEAR</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I kept doing many little, necessary things in harmony with his words or signs until another chill (the third one) came on.  I folded blanket after blanket over him, tucked them in close to him; but still he shook.  I therefore lay on him and pressed my face to his until I felt the warmth returning to his body.  The fact that this was the third chill in four nights deepened the impression in my mind that the end was drawing near.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">About midnight a great change came over him.  He no longer cared for any of his medicine, and did not even seem to thirst for water as heretofore.  Some things almost ceased. His pain settled deeper in.  He could no longer lie straight in bed as formerly.  He must sit up; and when he would lie down, he would double together, and his head would rest straight toward the window and free from the pillows. In this posture he would be quiet for awhile until his mouth would fill from his stomach, and he would signal to be raised.  Being relieved of this, he would request to be lowered for comfort, until, to prevent strangulation, he would be raised again.  This prevented it, and proper attention given, he would lie down again to get relief from pain.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This continued for seven hours with increased frequency and weakness.  When he could no longer make his wishes known by words, he would do so by signs.  When lying across the bed and desiring to be raised, he would lift his right hand and arm in such a way that my head would fit in the curvature of his arm and he could cling to my neck, while my left arm could fit around his neck, and thus elevate him to a sitting posture.  This continued until the thought arose in my mind as to who would become exhausted first. I thought of the friends at home, of the many interested friends everywhere.  I looked to the Lord, and steeled myself, saying, &quot;I will stay with him to the finish.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the early morning he surrendered.  He was exhausted; and I could now lay him straight in bed with his head on the pillow in its accustomed place, and he could at last rest. The calm after the storm had come.  He was now to die gradually, regularly, peacefully; and I was to stand by watching him, loving him, and expressing my affection for him by gently stroking his hair and his beard and rubbing his head, his face, his hands, and his feet.  I did not seem to be able to do enough for him, now that he had passed beyond a certain line.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                 </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE LAST HOURS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Several times on Monday I raised him up in bed, sat behind him so as to brace him; and his head would lean against mine.  Once he whispered, &quot;Have you anything to suggest?&quot;  I had; for I wished him to return direct to Galveston and take the steamer for New York, or else go through by train without stopping at Topeka, Tulsa or Lincoln.  He answered, &quot;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,&quot; by which I understood him to mean that Topeka and other places would take care of themselves when we got to them, and that we need not consider them as yet.  It was then that I asked him respecting the Seventh Volume, and afterwards sat meditating what to suggest.  After a period of perfect silence I thought I would say something to him about dying and certain matters connected therewith, but I hesitated and hardly knew how to begin.  He was sitting up in bed and I put my arm around his neck and said, &quot;Brother Russell, you are a very sick man.&quot;  His lip quivered; we lowered him, and turned away to weep.  I had gone far enough in that direction.  I knew not to attempt that again. It was evident that neither he nor I could stand it, and that nothing more could be done.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The most wonderful thing about this most wonderful man was that, during all his sufferings, trials, inconveniences and perplexities, he spoke not a word of complaint;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">he heaved not a sigh; he uttered not a moan; he shed not a tear.  He had resolved that he would not murmur nor complain, and he kept his resolution to the end.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We watched by his side all Tuesday morning with but little to do except to watch and pray.  Noticing that this was the last day of October, we concluded that he would died before midnight, and consequently wrote out the following telegram to the friends in Brooklyn: &quot;Before October closes our dearly Beloved Brother Russell will be with the Lord in glory.  We are alone in Car Roseisle on Santa Fe train No. 10, due in Kansas City 7:35 Wednesday morning, and he is dying like a hero.  After embalming will come home with his remains, or else go direct to Pittsburgh.&quot;  We called in the Pullman conductor and also the porter and said, &quot;We want you to see how a great man of God can die.&quot;  The sight deeply impressed them, especially the porter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6006 : page 366::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I called in the regular conductor, and telegraphed for a physician to board the train at Panhandle; and he did.  He saw the condition, recognized the correctness of the diagnosis and conclusion, gave me his name, and was off before the train got under headway.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At one o'clock all were dismissed from the room, the door was locked, and we quietly watched over him until he breathed his last.  We had observed the approaching signs of death before calling in the trainmen.  These continued until the finger nails became discolored, the cold perspiration settled upon that noble forehead, his hands and feet grew cold, his face indicated a break, he drew his feet up in the bed like Jacob of old, his quiet breathing became less frequent, his drooping eyelids opened like the petals of a flower and disclosed those eyes--those wonderful eyes! in all their magnificence --that we will never forget.  Presently he breathed no more; we pressed our lips upon his noble brow, and knew that he had gone to be forever with and like the Lord, whom he loved so well.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Dear Lord, oh, use me as the Angel in Gethsemane! Oh, fill me with Thy Holy Spirit of Divinest love! Oh, make me sympathetic, wise, that every anguished heart May come, nor seek in vain for consolation from Thy Word, And strengthened, comforted, go forth to prison or to death, To suffer patiently the cruel mockings of the tongue; To bear the cross unto the bitter end, and then to calmly say, 'Tis finished,' and with faith unwavering pass beneath 'the veil!'&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         BY W. E. VAN AMBURGH--NEW YORK</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The pages of history record many of mankind who have left conspicuous footprints upon the sands of time.  Some have been great within the boundaries of their local communities. Some have reached out to the national borders. Others have leaped all national bounds and exerted a world-wide influence.  Some have gained greatness because of positions of influence; others by their ability to command conquering armies or otherwise sway the destinies of nations; some by noble deeds; others by their ability to inspire their fellowmen to nobler lives and ambitions. Some have been born to great positions; and some have seemingly been forced into greatness by the exigencies of time or conditions; others, inspired by love and zeal for God, have laid down their lives willing sacrifices upon the altar of devotion.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The world is quick to applaud the conquering hero and the prince of finance, but slow to recognize the true worth of the daily smouldering sacrifices of those who heed the Master's admonition, &quot;Be thou faithful unto death.&quot;  It is left to other generations to enshrine the real heroes; as in the case of our Lord and His disciples; and we believe the same will be true of Pastor Russell.  Contemporaries too often misunderstand, misjudge, severely criticize and persecute.  How true this has been of all of God's noblemen of the past!  But God promises that all such as worship Him in the beauty of holiness in the midst of persecutions shall shine as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father--when their true greatness shall be revealed.  How glad we are that God is taking cognizance of all sacrifices of love in His behalf!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Today we are paying our last loving tribute to the memory of one of God's noblest men.  His life will speak for itself, when fully understood by succeeding generations.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I desire to add a brief personal testimony.  For over twenty years, I was personally acquainted with our beloved Pastor, and for over fifteen years closely associated with him in business and otherwise; so I speak from personal knowledge and close observation.  I first learned of him through his writings, and was drawn closer to the Lord by his logical exegesis of the Scriptures.  It may seem strange, but 'tis true I scarcely noticed the writer.  He was hidden behind the message.  Later I became acquainted with him personally, and was closely drawn to him when I perceived the spirit that actuated him--the loving, loyal, consecrated heart, seeking to follow his God, seeking daily to do good unto his fellowmen, to the best of his ability, and seeking to assist them to a clearer perception of the true character of our God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That he was misunderstood by many of his fellowmen mattered little to him, so long as he kept his heart right with God and had His approval.  I never met a man who in my estimation endeavored more earnestly to live close to God, or fought harder to keep his body under.  His influence upon others has been written in the hearts and lives of thousands all over the world whom he has assisted to a closer walk with God and a fuller consecration to the Lord and His Word.  His SCRIPTURE STUDIES and his other expositions led me to see more of the Wisdom, the Justice, the Love and the Power of God than I had ever recognized before, and helped me to serve Him more intelligently than I had been able to do previously, although since childhood I had earnestly sought to do God's will to the best of my ability.  As I saw with increasing clearness the Prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus, I was led to consecrate to my Savior every ability I possessed and to seek further understanding.  This consecration was made intelligently to my Lord, and I have ever endeavored to carry it out faithfully.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I would like now, as a further expression of my appreciation, to renew that consecration publicly.  There may be others here also who have been assisted to a far better understanding of God's great Plan and His love for mankind through the ministries of our dear Pastor.  (Thousands have so indicated.)  Would you also like to make this an occasion for renewal of your consecration?  My consecration was to no one but the Lord.  I recognized our beloved Brother as a servant of God--and a highly honored one.  But my consecration was to God.  This great world-wide work is not the work of one person.  It is far too great for that.  It is God's work and it changes not.  God has used many servants in the past and He will doubtless use many in the future.  Our consecration is not to a man, or to a man's work, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to do the will of God,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as He shall reveal it unto us through His Word and providential leadings. God is still at the helm, and His work will continue in harmony with His Plan.  Arrangements have been made for the carrying on of this work more earnestly than ever. It will be conducted along the same lines of full loyalty to the Word of God and love for the brethren, and it is for us to determine whether we shall be among its supporters and beneficiaries.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The speaker then asked, &quot;How many would like here to renew their consecration to God, and to indicate it by rising?&quot; Almost the entire audience, which packed the building, rose to their feet.  A most impressive moment followed. The speaker's face was raised to Heaven; and silently the audience followed the words:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Our Father, which art in Heaven, who canst look into the inner recesses of our hearts, Thou who dost not need the expression of our lips, to Thee, at this time,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6006 : page 367::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">we desire to renew our Covenant made with Thee by Sacrifice.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We consecrate afresh to Thee and to Thy service our every ability--our talents, and our opportunities--to be used as Thou in Thy wisdom mayst grant us understanding through Thy Holy Word and Thy daily leadings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;May we realize more and more the great privilege of being considered by Thee an acceptable sacrifice, through the atoning merit of Thy well-beloved Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And may the inspiration of the love of God, which constraineth us, and the Prize of the High Calling of God, in Christ Jesus, spur us to greater devotion to Thy cause and assist us to endure more faithfully than ever before, and to reflect in our every thought, word and deed Thy glorious character!&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Household of Faith.  The Pilgrims, therefore, were related to him as fellow-servants of the same God.  Therefore as God's representatives, and also in a sense as Brother Russell's representatives, they traveled throughout the world preaching the &quot;Glad Tidings.&quot;  Just as Moses was given as his colaborers the Seventy to whom God gave the Spirit that he had put upon Moses, because the work was too much for Moses to perform alone, so our Heavenly Father was pleased to give to this devoted servant of His colaborers to assist him in the labor of dispensing meat to the whole Church; for this work was too great for him alone to perform.  Therefore the Pilgrims were to bear part of the burden and toil that were his.  They, therefore, in a certain sense represent him.  In writing to them he at times reminded them that he loved to think and speak of them as being in a certain sense his representatives, though recognizing them primarily as the Lord's representatives.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was this office, therefore, that gave him a close and directing relation to the Pilgrims.  He was eminently fitted by nature, by grace, and by experience to fill the demands of this place.  He had a giant intellect with marvelous perceptive faculties, remarkable memory and clear, deep and true reasoning powers, combined with an exceptional knowledge of human nature and with tactful aggressiveness. These gave him great executive ability, which, of course, eminently fitted him to direct the work of the Pilgrims. Our Heavenly Father endowed him with a natural disposition, especially in his religious capacities, that very few of the fallen human race have had.  Under careful cultivation of the Holy Spirit these natural capacities were developed in a most remarkable degree into a character that had and combined all the qualities necessary to discharge the duties, responsibilities and privileges of his official relation to the Pilgrims.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His experience as a Pilgrim fitted him all the better to exercise properly and profitably the functions of this part of his office.  Therefore his relation to the Pilgrims officially was that of directing their work.  It was God's will that he should be the human agent whom God would use to select the Pilgrims.  In the selection of these servants no arbitrariness nor partiality was used.  His will was fully submitted to the Father's will as to how their selection should be conducted.  He subjected the Pilgrims to the three tests demanded by God's Word as proper to be placed upon public servants of God.  First of all he required of them that, in addition to a full consecration, they have a large degree of loving zeal, deep humility, exemplary meekness and an accurate knowledge of God's Word.  He further required that they have in a large degree the talents necessary for teaching and preaching the Word of God clearly, acceptably and winsomely to responsive hearts.  Lastly he required their providential situation to be such as would enable them in harmony with the Word to assume the duties, responsibilities and privileges of the Pilgrim service. When these three things met in an individual, Brother Russell was very glad to arrange for his having a part in the Pilgrim service.  His methods in selecting such were quite unique; e.g., unobserved, he listened to a Brother, whom he did not know, explain the chart to several of the friends.  The explanation was so clear that he inquired who that Brother was.  Finding out his name he entered into correspondence with him, inviting him to enter the Pilgrim service.  Those who were to be given the privilege of this office were subjected by him to certain tests that would demonstrate the possession or lack of meekness, humility, zeal, clearness in presenting the Truth, and a large measure of love and self-control.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His instructions to the Pilgrims were very simple.  He believed that few instructions were better than many.  A Pilgrim, on starting out asked him, &quot;Brother, have you some word of instruction, encouragement or caution to give to me that will prove helpful to me in the service?&quot; He answered, &quot;No; Brother.&quot;  Then thinking a while he said, &quot;Yes; Brother, I have.  Be full of loving zeal and deep humility, and everything will be well.&quot;  He was wont to say, 'If you are in any difficulty or if you have a problem which you cannot solve, remember you always have an open ear and a willing hand here.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He allowed as much liberty to the Pilgrims as the good of the Cause and themselves warranted.  He allowed them to choose their subjects and to use their way of presenting the message, not wishing to interfere with their individuality, believing the Lord was directing with respect to each one.  Only such restrictions were made as were necessary for the profit of the Cause and its participants. Whenever correction was necessary it was given in a remarkably sweet form.  One of the Pilgrims asked for too frequent vacations, alleging that he needed more time for study.  Brother Russell, feeling that the Brother should have had more zeal, suggested that the Brother take a year's time off from the Pilgrim service for study.  The Brother, catching the Pastor's meaning, immediately declared, &quot;Brother, that would be a loss of too much time. I will go right on.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was always on the alert to encourage others; and no Pilgrim left his presence without being encouraged, if he was in an encourageable condition of heart and mind. When correction was needed, it was given with the greatest tact and leniency, allowances being made for good intentions. Whenever he had any changes to make, promotions or demotions in the service, they were made not from personal reasons, but because of the principles in the Heavenly Father's Word.  His course was that of completely sinking his will into the Lord's will and of searching to find out what that will was in relation to each Pilgrim, that he might be able the better to help him in the good work.  Whenever a dismissal from the work had been arranged for, it was done in the most tactful and quiet way, that others would not need to realize the reason, nor the Pilgrim experience unnecessary pain.  The person was in a</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6007 : page 368::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">very gentle and loving way invited to enter some other field of activity, to the glory of God and his own profit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His attitude toward the Pilgrim work was one full of encouragement to the Pilgrims.  One of his greatest services to them was his example of faithful service.  This influenced them in many ways, even in tone and gesture. Undoubtedly the Pilgrims will remember with joy the thought that as his first Harvest work was that of a Pilgrim, so his last Harvest labor was Pilgrim work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we are not to think that his official relation to the Pilgrims was all there was in his relation to them.  He was not an official simply, nor one that no one could approach. He was a most lovable and considerate person, always inviting confidence.  In addition to his official relation he sustained a many-sided personal relation to the Pilgrims. First of all, he was like a faithful father to them.  Not having natural children, he was blessed by the Lord in begetting many spiritual children with the Truth; even as the Apostle Paul said he did in the case of many.  Brother Russell introduced many people into the Lord's family, and not a few of the Pilgrims were among these.  A Pilgrim recently remarked, &quot;I never consciously had a father, until I entered the Pilgrim service and came in direct contact with Brother Russell.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was not only a father, but also an elder Brother to the Pilgrims, always ready to stand side by side with them.  Therefore he was not regarded solely with the feeling that people should have for a father.  As elder Brother, he inspired the Pilgrims with confidence in, together with respect for, himself.  He was, furthermore, a true friend.  He did not whimfully take one up today and drop him tomorrow.  He was faithful to his friends with a loyalty based upon the good Word of God.  Every Pilgrim recognized that he could depend upon the friendship of this beloved servant.  He was an affectionate companion.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our dear Brother Sturgeon told us a little while ago how he showed his comradeship to the last.  He was also a most sympathetic comforter.  Any one in distress, especially spiritual distress, seeking comfort, would find in him an attentive ear, a sympathizing heart, a cheering word and an encouraging thought.  By nature he was very richly endowed with sympathy and by grace this was more highly developed than the majority of his other qualities.  This enabled him to enter into the feelings of so many when they came to him with the things that pressed them sorely.  This made him a sympathizing comforter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Furthermore, this good servant of God was an optimistic well-wisher.  He always put the best construction on everything.  He gave each one credit for good intentions. His desires and expectations were that these beloved colaborers of his might have a glorious entrance into the blessed Kingdom into which we feel sure that he has entered, who was called by the Lord not only &quot;wise,&quot; but also &quot;faithful.&quot;  He was a cheerful helper.  Nothing pleased him more than to serve others.  He was continually thinking and planning how he could help by counsel, by example, and by deeds.  Every rightly disposed person who came in contact with him was refreshed and encouraged. He was always thinking, not of himself, but of others.  That is why his death was so glorious.  He had thought that he would probably pass away as a martyr.  In many respects his death has been more glorious than a martyr's; for to him was given the privilege not to allow a large measure of his life to be taken from him by violence, but to use up every ounce of his strength in service, for he died in the harness.  Such a death was best for him.  God will decide what kind of a death is best for each.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">             BY G.C. DRISCOLL--DAYTON</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   No greater honor could come to me than to stand here as the delegate of the Dayton, Ohio, Ecclesia, who have elected our dear Brother annually for many years as their beloved Pastor, whom we recognized as a special servant of God.  He was doing a special work at this time, and we certainly learned to love him.  For years I have been intimately associated with our dear Pastor as his publicity representative and for the Society.  It has been my special privilege to arrange with newspapers in various countries for the publication of his sermons, and also to interview editors throughout the world in respect to his personal work; and, dear friends, as one who knew him intimately, I am glad to be here to say that he was nothing if not a thorough-going, conscientious, sincere Christian, whose greatest endeavor was to serve the Lord, the Truth and the brethren.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that he has been assailed many times unjustly; and it was my special privilege often for at least seven years to defend his character.  When his sermons were first syndicated, Brother Russell refused to permit his portrait to be used in connection with them.  He was very modest in that respect.  He felt that he was entitled to the privacy of his own picture; that it should not be paraded before the public.  But the newspaper editors, who were glad to get his sermons, could not be ignored; and the demand was uniform that they should have it, that they should be privileged to publish it in connection with his sermon.  Brother Russell finally gave his consent; for he came to the conclusion that by the publication of his picture, he would get a wider reading for his Message, the Message of God, the Message regarding the Kingdom. For this reason, and this alone, he gave his consent.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As for the picture, there has been no man in this age to equal our dear Brother.  He was an outstanding figure in a crowd.  No matter whether he was seated in a train or in a street car or was walking on the street, people would stop and turn around to get a second look.  Many a time I have heard people say that he looked like the Lord, if ever a man did.  His very appearance widened his influence for the glory of God.  As his influence grew, the opposition also grew, and they learned to hate that picture because he stood for something different from what they did.  I remember one preacher stating that he could not pick up a paper to read the news without having Pastor Russell stare him in the face.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">POSSIBLY MORE THAN IN THE PAST</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Now, my friends, this was all distasteful to our dear Brother.  But the Message of the Kingdom was thus brought before the people, and he had evidences day by day, many times over, that the people were receiving a blessing.  In that way he received a blessing also; and the use of his portrait gave the Message of the Love of God wider use in various ways.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now that this noble face is soon to be covered to be seen no more, we can confidently say, &quot;This mortal has put on immortality.&quot;  This wonderful character was sown in weakness, but we are sure that it was raised in power. He has served us in many ways.  His picture has also served us in many ways in the past; and I am sure if we give the cooperation which we now shall have the opportunity to give, by the Lord's grace, we can still use his personality and his picture possibly more than in the past.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">           BY FRANK W. MANTON--TORONTO</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Unexpectedly I have the honor of representing the Toronto, Ont., Ecclesia here this afternoon in paying the last tribute of esteem to the memory of our Beloved Pastor. Three hundred or more of the Toronto Ecclesia, together with many sympathizers, are rejoicing today in the fact that our Beloved has triumphantly finished his course.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we have no apologies to make for sadness.  We remind you of our Lord, when at Bethany at the tomb of Lazarus; we read that even &quot;Jesus wept.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Under the circumstances you will pardon a personal reference.  About nine years ago I was brought into contact with the Truth, and accepted it in a measure, as most of us do at first, reservedly.  I was prepared to meet our Beloved Pastor on his first visit to Toronto after my contact with the Truth with some degree of prejudice.  We had heard so much about &quot;Brother Russell&quot; that we had considered it in a large measure a form of hero worship; and not being a hero-worshiper, I received him with these thoughts in view.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Being invited to dine with him at the hotel with other friends, I was on the alert to find, if possible, some flaw; but, to my great surprise, I never met a character in every way so beyond reproach.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Immediately after dinner, having to take the car for the public meeting, I endeavored to carry his hand-bag, but he was too quick for me.  Before that day was over my prejudice had melted as the hoar frost before the morning sun.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another incident which impressed me happened some years ago.  Sitting at my desk one day, I received a telegram: &quot;Will you serve as Chairman at my Ottawa meeting?&quot; I thought, Now I have found him in a mistake! He had never heard me speak in public, because I had never attempted to do so.  I did not reply to the telegram for several days, meantime counseling with my wife.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I overcame my hesitation and wired back, &quot;Yes.&quot;  After the telegram had gone and the end of the week had come, and it was time for me to go, my wife pointed out that there was something in Brother Russell's telegram that I had overlooked.  I tried to ignore that fact, but after the discourse in Ottawa, when our Beloved Pastor was bowing himself off the platform, he lifted his hands and said, &quot;Mr. F.W. Manton, of Toronto, will lecture in the Family Theater here next Sunday afternoon.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear friends, I was not an Elder, I had never spoken in public, and I thought, I have him now; he has again made a mistake!  I struggled with my feelings during the following week--almost struggled myself out of the Truth. Dear friends, he did not make a mistake in the Lord's sight, I am sure; I am striving to do my best in His service, and if it had not been for our dear Pastor's keen insight, I might never have had this privilege.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The third and most vivid impression was made upon me by our Pastor recently.  You were all moved to indignation, no doubt, when you learned that the gates of Canada were unjustly closed to our dear Pastor.  I had the honor of standing with him in the Toronto Union Depot when word was received that he would not be allowed to address further public meetings in Canada.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The righteous indignation of those present there was stirred; we wanted to demand what right the authorities had to shut out a Christian gentleman who had in no way dishonored himself or his cause, and who had every right to speak.  He merely said, &quot;I will not go where I am not wanted.  If they want me, I will come.&quot;  There was not the least note of resentment in his words.  We were rebuked, by his example, for our resentment.  We had been tempted to reclaim the life-rights which we had laid down in sacrifice; we were not citizens of that country, but of the Heavenly one!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Especially would I bring to the notice of the Elders of the various Ecclesias at this time the beautiful picture of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6009 : page 370::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Sheep in the Storm&quot;--how they are huddled together, head to head, for safety and protection.  Let us keep this in mind.  It was the first thought that came to me when I fully realized that our Beloved Brother had passed beyond the Veil.  The next thought was of joy, born of the assurance that he is now part of the glorified Body of The Christ, and beyond the reach of his enemies!</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In the city of Washington, whence I came, there are many sad hearts today, on account of the loss sustained in the death of our Beloved Pastor.  Not only several hundred Bible Students, who diligently search the Scriptures, aided by his writings, but many thousands of others, recognizing the grandeur of his character, mingle their tears together.  Sorrow and joy are mixed; for we are mindful that he has finished his course, that he was faithful, and therefore must now have the promised reward.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have known Brother Russell intimately for twenty years.  He has many times been a guest at my home, and I have also been a guest at his home.  I was privileged to be associated with him for four months in a tour around the world; I lived with him, day and night, under varied circumstances; he was a gentleman, aye, more, a Christian, a highly developed Christian; in fact the most highly developed Christian I ever knew, a noble representative of our Lord.  I loved him in life, I honor him now in death, and pay tribute to his memory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES will continue to make luminous the Bible.  The Associated Bible Students throughout the earth will continue to look to Brooklyn as heretofore, thankful to our Lord for the wise provision our Beloved Pastor has made for the perpetuation of the work.  Confidence and loyalty will be manifested by all true children of God; for the Truth is just as precious to us today as ever it was.  It came from our Heavenly Father through our Lord Jesus, and was made plain by his servant, our dear Brother Russell, whom we all highly esteemed in love for his works' sake.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Twenty-five years ago it was my privilege to meet for the first time the few Bible Students who met yearly in Allegheny at the Memorial season.  There at the home of our Brother we were privileged to meet him who has now sacrificed his life for the Truth he so dearly loved.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As years passed, we became more closely associated with him, and as we were enabled to see in him that wonderful, Christ-like character which has been a source of great blessing to many, our love and respect for him increased.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   No greater honor could be accorded me at the present time than to be here to speak a few words of tribute to the memory of our dear Brother.  My relationship to him has been different in some respects, perhaps, from that of any other individual; for I have been closely associated with him for a great while.  Many a time I have stood on the platform and introduced him to various audiences in this country and abroad.  I am glad to be here at this time to say a few words.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For ten years my work in connection with the Convention Reports has brought me in close contact with Brother Russell and the work of the Society in general. Our understanding has been thorough on this matter. Then, too, I have traveled extensively with him as his secretary on various trips, particularly in connection with the world tour in 1912, when for nearly four months we were closely associated.  Many times Brother Russell discussed with me his personal and private affairs, as well as the work in hand; and I desire to say that his one aim was to seek to do the will of God, and in it all he recognized that the work he was doing was not his, but Jehovah's.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the friends in Chicago learned through the newspaper reports that Brother Russell's death had taken place, they could not believe their ears and eyes, and repeatedly called me up to verify the reports.  As soon as we told them, &quot;Yes, it is true that our dear Pastor has gone beyond,&quot; immediately they would say, &quot;Brother, now we must keep close together.  We must put our shoulders to the wheel. We must loyally cooperate.&quot;  It did me much good to see the faith of the brethren and know that they would stand loyal to the Truth.  Therefore at this time I voice the sentiments not only of the Chicago Church as a whole, but of the various Classes in the vicinity of Chicago, numbering about twelve or fifteen.  Their determination is to stand loyal and faithful to the new organization and to cooperate with it in every possible way.  They realize that our dear Pastor has opened before us the Scriptures, and has made them so plain that everything necessary for the making of our calling and election sure, has been laid before the faithful and loyal, that we may press on to a glorious consummation, even unto death, as he did.  It is our determination to be more loyal, more faithful, that we may promulgate this glorious Gospel--&quot;glad tidings of joy&quot;--in this Harvest work which he so grandly started, which he so faithfully carried on until the great God whom he served said, &quot;Enough, come up higher!&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The Boston Class of Bible Students were greatly shocked when the news came over the wire telling of our beloved Pastor's death, or home-going.  We felt such a sadness and loneliness; yet our hearts rejoiced to know that our dearly beloved Brother had been changed from the human to the Divine nature; that his has been the blessed privilege of entering into the presence of the King of Kings, even into Heaven itself.  Yes; how blessed!  He has gone to be forever with the Lord.  We keenly feel our loss.  He whom God had been pleased to use as our light-bringer and comforter can no longer give personal words of comfort and advice.  Yet, by Divine Providence, so much has come to us from his pen we feel the store-house has been left filled with food; and our desire is to partake of this provision, doing our part in telling out the Gospel message, which is good tidings of great joy, and which</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A special meeting of the Boston Church was called almost immediately, and from four to five hundred quickly came together.  Resolutions were unanimously passed, expressing our sincere Christian love and sympathy for all the bereaved ones throughout the world, and in a special way to the dear Bethel Family and Tabernacle workers. All were commended to God for His special care and blessing. The words of the Apostle comfort us: &quot;My God shall supply all of your need, according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a personal testimony, I wish to state that it has been my privilege to travel with our dear Brother Russell for days, weeks and months at a time, both in America and during his journey around the world.  My greatest impressions were, how implicitly he trusted the Lord in everything!  Whether on train, steamboat or at hotel, before taking up the day's work, he would kneel and ask God's blessing and help.  We shall never forget his ceaseless and untiring love for all the Church, ever trying to enlighten and comfort them, even laying down his life for the brethren when his body was worn and racked with pain.  He would never murmur nor complain, but would say, &quot;We have it so much easier than did the Apostles and our dear Lord.&quot;  WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT US!  Truly he has earned the victor's Crown!</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">            BY A.I. RITCHIE--NEW YORK</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Our Pastor was very dear to the Bethel Family.  He was a loving, yet just head over the Home, and all the members of the Family had ready access to him with their perplexities and troubles.  It was interesting to notice how almost all went away from these interviews smiling, as if all difficulties had been cleared up.  He seemed almost intuitively to understand; and was always sympathetic and tender, even when he himself was suffering great pain.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When I read his DIVINE PLAN OF THE AGES in 1888, it answered all my questions; and as I continued to read my love and admiration for him increased, though I never met him until 1905.  My later years of close association with him were a constant inspiration to me.  The better I knew him, the better I loved him.  He was the best man I ever saw, and I never expect to see his equal.  There is none like him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He entered so fully into our lives that there might be a danger of thinking of him as belonging peculiarly to the Bethel Family, or to the New York Ecclesia, or at least to the Bible Students of America.  But he was broader than all these; he was loved and respected by Bible Students and Truth seekers the world over.  He was also respected and loved by devout Jews in almost every part of the world, and helped much to revive their faith in their Bible promises.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides all this I am convinced that he did more to mould public thought--especially in the religious world--than all other contemporary religious leaders.  Very few now believe the doctrine of eternal torment; thanks to his efforts!  He brought many other religious truths to light.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Our dear Redeemer taught us that &quot;man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&quot;  The words that our Redeemer Himself spoke were especially precious to our Brother, so that the Lord's slightest word or act spoke volumes to him.  One little point he explained in reference to the man whose eyes the Lord opened.  The Lord spat upon the ground; and out of the clay and the spittle He made an ointment, with which He anointed the eyes of the blind man.  Then the man washed in the pool of Siloam, and returned seeing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Brother Russell calls our attention to the fact that this illustrates how the Spirit of the Lord, coming out of His mouth, comes down and mixes with the clay of earth; and thus that clay, if plastic enough, can be applied for the opening of the spiritual eyes of those that were born blind.</font><br />

Praise His name for the blessings brought to us through our dear Pastor!</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our beloved Pastor's death has aroused in our hearts all that is noblest, holiest, best.  We rejoice unselfishly that his labors are over, and that he has entered into his rest and reward.  We sorrow as we feel keenly the loss of his faithful ministry.  We sympathize with one another in our bereavement, and especially with those closest to him in his labors.  We feel an increased concern for the continuance of the work he was God's instrument in carrying forward.  We are resolved that by God's grace we shall be inspired by our Beloved Brother's life and teachings to greater faithfulness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was my privilege to know our Pastor upwards of twenty years, and his personal example was perhaps even more inspiring than his teachings.  He never worried, was never impatient.  His peace of mind was wonderful.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Beloved Pastor took a genuine, personal interest in all of the Lord's people.  He rejoiced in their progress, and treasured their interesting experiences in his wonderful memory.  To illustrate: When on the way home from a one-day convention he asked one of our number: &quot;Is old Brother K----- living yet?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Kindly give him my Christian greetings and tell him that I remember the testimony he gave in Allegheny some twenty years ago.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Brethren, our beloved brother has left us a noble example. Shall we not follow him, as he followed Christ? Shall we not lay down our lives for the brethren, as he did?  By God's grace we will!  May our end be as his!</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was my privilege to know our dear Brother personally; and I wish to state one thing with regard to him that possibly not all know.  For years he suffered with a peculiar ailment, which rendered him very, very weak at times; and he could hardly go on with his discourses for pain.  We can better appreciate the wonderful character of our beloved Pastor when we know that he was usually under stress and pain.  I prescribed for him at one time; but when two years after, I asked him if he had taken the medicine, he remarked, &quot;Dear Brother, I have not had time.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If our beloved Pastor, now glorified, has shown us such a wonderful example of cheerfulness and long suffering it behooves us to follow faithfully in his steps.  The action of the Detroit Class, taken at the testimony meeting Wednesday,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We wish to assure those whom the Pastor has left in charge of the Society's affairs of our loyalty and of our resolution to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ at all times. When a vacancy comes to the ranks, let us press together the harder, shoulder to shoulder, and close it up as best we can.  Let us crystallize our character, so that we may be able to endure all things, for God will cause the wrath of man to praise Him and will prepare us for His presence by means of reproaches and persecutions, which probably await us.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Charles Taze Russell was loyal to God, loyal to Christ Jesus, loyal to the cause of Messiah's Kingdom.  He was loyal to the core--yea, loyal even unto death.  God has declared in His Word that loving loyalty to Him is the price of greatest riches.  Pastor Russell has received his great reward. It is a wonderful thing to receive the approval of God, the great and mighty Creator of the Universe, the all-wise, all-powerful and all-loving One.  In His Book, the Bible, God has made favorable mention of certain men; and in every instance that favorable mention has been because of their loving loyalty to Him and His cause of righteousness.  When God's record concerning the Church is fully written, the people will find that Charles Taze Russell not only has received favorable mention from God, but has been born in Zion--a member of the Royal Family of Heaven. (`Psalm 87:6`.)  The Psalmist has assured us that this is especially true of those who are faithful unto death.  What a wonderful privilege it will be for the world to have the real truth concerning martyrs to the cause of righteousness!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We who have come into closer contact with Pastor Russell, and who knew him as he was, are privileged by the Lord to know these things in advance of the world.  Happy is our lot to thus be favored of God.</font><br />

We have come aside this evening from the busy rush of this great city to pay tribute to the memory of Pastor Russell.  Let us in calmness and sobriety seek to know why this man was great, why we say with such assurance that he had the approval of God.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PASTOR RUSSELL'S SEARCH FOR TRUTH</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Nearly 65 years ago, a child was born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.  His parents christened him Charles Taze Russell.  His parents loved God and sought to obey Him.  The parental influence was good for Charles.  They trained the small twig; and it grew in the direction of the Lord.  Early he became a Christian.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But like other good, honest, conscientious Christian men and women, his parents had been taught the man-made creeds of the Church Nominal.  Young Charles was taught that God is great and good, yet that He had made all men inherently immortal, and had provided a lake of fire and brimstone in which he would eternally torment all except a few whom He had predestinated should be saved.  The honest heart of the lad revolted against such a horrible thing; and he in substance said, &quot;I cannot believe that there is a just and wise God who would do such a thing to a poor, unfortunate human being.&quot;  Forthwith he forsook the religion of the creeds; but while he was investigating other religions, his mind was turning to the Lord in an inquiring manner.  Then he said, &quot;I will study the Bible, and see whether or not it teaches that God has such an arrangement.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True to his inborn character, he honestly and prayerfully searched the Scriptures.  To his astonishment and joy he found that the Bible is God's great Word of Truth; that God has a great Plan of Salvation, provided by Him before the foundation of the world, which shall ultimately result in the blessing of human-kind.  From the Bible he learned that God created the father of the human race--Adam, the first man--a perfect being, gave unto him a perfect wife, placed him in a perfect home under perfect conditions, and advised him that obedience to the Divine law would enable man to maintain this condition of perfection; that Adam violated the law of God and was sentenced to death; that he was then driven from his perfect home into the unfinished earth; that God permitted him to live for 930 years after he had been sentenced to death; that while undergoing this sentence, Adam for the first time exercised his power and authority to beget children; that by the law of heredity all of his children were born in sin and shapen in iniquity, and hence all came under the effects of the just penalty that had come upon the father--&quot;that as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death has passed upon all men, for all are sinners&quot;; that ultimately the whole human race</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6012 : page 373::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">would perish from the earth (death meaning destruction;) that man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a soul; that he does not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possess</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one; that the soul consists of the body and the breath of life--the life principle--and these being separated, the soul is dead.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">              </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HIS SEARCH REWARDED</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Then he learned that God had lovingly provided a Plan of Redemption of man from this condition of death--that God so loved the world that He gave His Only-Begotten Son, that whosoever would believe in Him should not perish, but have life everlasting--that Jesus, having a pre-human existence as a spirit being, was made human and grew to manhood's estate, in order that He, by the grace of God, might give His own perfect life whereby the purchase price would be provided for the redemption of Adam and all his race--that He died upon the cross and provided this price-- that He was raised from the dead, no longer a man, but now Divine, and that He ascended into Heaven, there to use the merit of His human sacrifice according to the will of God --for the blessing of mankind.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Furthermore, he learned from the Scriptures that the Lord Jesus would return and establish a Kingdom for the blessing of mankind; that in the interim between His resurrection and His Second Coming, God has been and is holding an election for the purpose of selecting from amongst men those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus as members of the Royal Family, and who, together with their Head and Master, will be the instrument through which Jehovah will bless all human-kind with the privileges of life, health and happiness; that the terms of this election are that everyone who desires to run for such a Prize must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and consecrate his life--his all--to the service of the Lord; that those who would prove faithful, true and loyal unto death would participate in the First or Chief Resurrection, and be made kings and priests unto God and unto Christ and reign with Christ for the blessing of mankind.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This wonderful story of the love of God thrilled the heart of young Russell.  He readily and joyfully consecrated his all to the service of the Lord, and continued faithful in that service even unto death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Charles Taze Russell loved his fellow-men.  Seeing the great truths contained in the Bible, he said, &quot;I must preach these to my fellow-creatures; I must use all my power to lead the people out of darkness, that they may see the love of God.&quot;  Vehemently he declared, &quot;If the Bible does teach that eternal torture is the fate of all except the saints, it should be preached--yea, thundered from the house-tops weekly, daily, hourly; if it does not so teach, the fact should be made known, and the foul stain dishonoring God's holy name removed.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With a strong physique, a fertile brain, and a brave heart, wholly devoted to the Lord, he consecrated and used all of his power to teach man the great Message of Messiah's Kingdom and the blessings which it will bring to the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Early in his manhood he possessed a fortune of no mean size.  He spent it all that the minds of men might be enlightened and their hearts made glad.  Early in his battle for righteousness he spent, out of his own private fortune, forty thousand dollars in this great city of New York for the publication and free distribution of a booklet setting forth clearly the Truth concerning the doctrine of the Hell of the Bible, that all might learn that Jehovah is a God of Love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Other Christian people, sadly aware of the fact that they were not receiving spiritual food in the various churches to which they had attached themselves, had the eyes of their understanding opened by reading their Bibles in the light of the explanation thereof given by Charles Taze Russell.  Gladly they began to support him and the righteous work in which he was engaged.  Without solicitation or invitation, they joyfully brought forth their money and said, &quot;What can we</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6012 : page 374::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">do to have part in this glorious work which you have begun?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">More than thirty years ago, a congregation of Christian people formed at Pittsburgh, Pa., selected Charles Taze Russell as their Pastor; and he served that congregation continuously as Pastor to the end, being able, however, to visit them only occasionally since the removal of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY headquarters to Brooklyn several years ago.  He wrote and published a series of books-- STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES--in six volumes, which turned a great flood of light upon God's Word.  Millions of these have gone into the homes of men throughout the earth, bringing gladness to their hearts.  For more than thirty years he edited and published a semi-monthly journal, THE WATCH TOWER AND HERALD OF CHRIST'S PRESENCE, wholly devoted to the cause of Messiah's Kingdom.  Be it known that this is the only publication on earth that has ever announced the presence of our Lord.  The Lord Jesus promised that at His Second Coming, which should be invisible to human eyes, He would have one wise and faithful servant whom He would make ruler over all His goods to give meat to the Household of Faith in due season.  Christians throughout the world who are familiar with the work of Pastor Russell readily recognize that he has long been that wise and faithful servant of the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The work grew to great proportions; and desiring that it might be conducted in a systematic manner and perpetuated after his death, he organized the WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY--a corporation, the charter of which was written by his own hand and is admitted, by men who know, to be a most remarkable document.  Through this channel he has promulgated the message of Messiah's Kingdom to all the nations of the earth.  Branches of this Society have been established and are maintained in the countries of Great Britain, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, France, South Africa, Australia, and in many other parts of the world.  His publications have been translated into 34 different languages, and millions of copies have been supplied free to the people by means of money joyfully contributed by those with him who love the Lord and His cause of righteousness and who are looking with joy to the establishment of His Kingdom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Pastor Russell traveled and preached to the people throughout the world.  He was elected Pastor of the Congregation at this Temple, and of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, of the London Tabernacle, of the Temple Congregation at Washington, D.C., the Congregation at Pittsburgh, the Auditorium Congregation at Chicago, the Congregation at St. Louis, Los Angeles, and those in many other parts of the world.  These he visited at regular intervals, to encourage and comfort and help them.  During the past few years his sermons have not only been heard from the platform, but have been published in approximately four thousand papers; and in practically every home of the United States and Canada Pastor Russell is known.  He did a greater work for the cause of Messiah's Kingdom than did any other man that ever lived on the earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HIS DYING HOURS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   A few weeks ago he started on a trip to the Pacific Coast, preaching every evening, and traveling throughout the remainder of the night and of the day.  His last sermon he preached to the Congregation at Los Angeles; and being too weak to stand, he sat throughout the discourse.  He left Los Angeles Sunday evening on his return to Brooklyn, and rapidly grew weaker.  Seven hours before his death, addressing his traveling companion, Brother Menta Sturgeon, he said, &quot;Make me a Roman toga.&quot;  Using the bed sheets, Brother Sturgeon made a toga, which Brother Russell put on himself. He stood erect for a moment, and then lying down on the couch in his Pullman drawing room, closed his eyes, thus in symbolic language speaking of death.  A great deal of the Bible is written in symbolic language, and it was quite appropriate that he should speak his last message in symbols.  It is interesting here to know what a Roman toga symbolizes: Augustus' Poet Laureate, said, &quot;It is by the toga that the royal nation is recognized.&quot;  The word toga means a covering garment (white robe).  It was the official robe of higher magistrates, priests and of persons discharging vows, and was worn on special occasions, such as celebrating a triumph.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are reminded of the last experiences of the Apostle Paul, who traveled with his beloved companion Timothy, whom he called his son--not a natural son, but, as St. Paul stated, he had begotten this young man in the spirit.  Likewise Pastor Russell begot Brother Sturgeon in the spirit, in that he brought Brother Sturgeon to a knowledge of the Divine Plan.  Shortly before St. Paul's death he wrote, &quot;I am now ready to be offered up, and the time of my departure is at hand; I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge, shall give me at that Day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.&quot; (`2 Timothy 4:6-8`.) Our dear Brother Russell not only loved the appearing of the Lord Jesus, but above all men on the earth he declared the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Master.  Brother Russell was a very modest man and never exalted himself.  It was exceedingly difficult to get him to speak of himself.  He chose, therefore, a symbol which we could afterwards interpret to speak practically the same thing spoken by the Apostle Paul.  By wearing the toga Brother Russell in effect said, &quot;I have fought the good fight; I have triumphed and shall be received as a member of the Royal Family of Heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What a wonderful example and inspiration for the other members of the Body of Christ this side the veil to earnestly strive to receive the approval of the Lord!</font><br />

St. Paul wrote, &quot;Behold, I show you a mystery:  We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:51,52`.)  God's Word points out that the resurrection of the saints would take place at the presence of the Lord and before the inauguration of His Kingdom; and the Scriptures clearly teach that this resurrection is now in progress; that our dear Brother and Pastor sleeps not in death, but was instantaneously changed from the human to the Divine nature, and is now forever with the Lord--glorious reward for a true and faithful servant.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been announced that he was to speak in this Temple tonight.  God had directed otherwise!  Brother Russell had prepared a sermon to preach to you, and I am sure you will be glad to hear it.  The lips of the body he used on earth are silent, but his words yet are spoken.  By God's grace it is my privilege here to be used, and to speak forth to you the message which he left.  My friends, give heed, if you please, while I read this message to the Church and to the world.  Behold, how appropriate the subject:</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Watchman, what of the night?...The morning cometh,</font></b><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">        </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and a night also.&quot;--`Isaiah 21:11,12`.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;The literature of the world shows that intelligent men have refused to believe that the Divine Purpose in the creation of our earth has yet been attained.  Continually we find references to 'the Morning of the New Day,' to the 'Golden Age,' etc., etc.  Yet not to the longings of men's hearts, but to the promises of our God, do we look for real instruction on this subject.  The Bible most emphatically declares that the entire period of human history thus far has been a night time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Prophet David explains, 'Weeping may endure for a Night, but joy cometh in the Morning.' (`Psalm 30:5`.) Thus prophetically we are assured that there will be a Morning whose glory, brightness and blessings will fully compensate for all the dark shadows of the Night time past.  Our text is another prophecy along the same line.  The message of the Lord is, 'The Morning cometh.' St. Paul writes that up to his time the world had been under a reign of Sin and Death, not under a Reign</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6013 : page 375::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of Righteousness and Life. (`Romans 5:21`.)  He points out also that the Day of the Lord will come, and will come gradually, stealthily, taking the world unawares-- 'as a thief in the night.'--`1 Thessalonians 5:1-6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;All of the Apostles assure us that it is not God's purpose to permit the reign of Sin and Death to continue forever.  They tell us that the Divine Program is that Messiah, in the Father's appointed time, will take to Himself His great power and reign King of kings and Lord of lords--putting down sin and every evil thing, uplifting humanity and granting a Divine blessing where for six thousand years there has been a Divine curse.  The Bible writers explain that this does not signify a change in the Divine Purpose, but that God had planned this thing in Himself from before the foundation of the world; and that although He had permitted Sin to enter and Death to reign, He had made fullest provision for the Redeemer to die for our sins and eventually to become the Restorer and Life-giver to Adam and his race--to as many of them as will accept everlasting life on the Divine terms.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Apostles tell us that during the 'night time,' since Jesus' death, God has been doing a special work-- selecting from mankind a special class, a saintly few-- 'the Church of the First-borns, whose names are written in Heaven.'  These are not taken from any one nation or denomination.  This 'little flock,' to whom it is the Father's good pleasure to give the Kingdom (`Luke 12:32`), is composed of all the saintly followers of Jesus, who walk in His steps in the narrow way during this Gospel Age.  Their experiences are to qualify them for association with their Redeemer in His Messianic Kingdom. Their trials, their obedience and their sufferings for righteousness' sake are to work out for these a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.  Suffering with the Master for the Truth's sake in the present life, they are to share His glory, honor and immortality in the life to come.  They are to be His joint-heirs in His Kingdom. --`Galatians 3:29`; `2 Timothy 2:11,12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE KINGDOM SUNRISE NEARING</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Amongst the Lord's people even, few yet understand that Jesus distinctly teaches that the 'Sun of Righteousness,' which will arise with healing in His beams and whose light will constitute the New Day, will be composed of the Church of Christ glorified--changed from human to Divine nature by participation in the First Resurrection. Our Lord Jesus tells this in the parable of the Wheat and the Tares.  He declares that in the end of this Gospel Age all of the wheat class will be gathered into the Heavenly Garner, and that 'then shall the righteous shine forth as the SUN in the Kingdom of their Father.' (`Matthew 13:43`.)  We must not think, however that this signifies the Church without the Redeemer, but must remember that Jesus is 'the Head over the Church which is His Body.'--`Ephesians 1:22,23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;How wonderful, how beautiful, how appropriate are the word-pictures of the Bible!  No one but the Lord knew of the great Divine Plan.  No one but Him, therefore, could give these pictures of its development.  In various terms and figures of speech the Bible attempts to give us a little glimpse of the glorious conditions of that Day.  The New Day and the Kingdom will be 'the desire of all people.'  In that Day the righteous will flourish, and evil-doers will be cut off from life.  During that thousand-year Day of Messiah's Kingdom, Satan is to be bound, 'that he may deceive the nations no more.' (`Revelation 20:2,3`.)  Landlordism will come to an end; for 'they shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat the fruit thereof,' but 'shall long enjoy the work of their hands.'--`Isaiah 65:22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The earth is to yield her increase. (`Psalm 67:6`.) Streams are to come forth in the desert; the solitary places are to be made glad.  The entire earth is to become like the Garden of Eden.  It is God's footstool, and He declares that He will make it glorious.  It is not to be burned up with literal fire, as once we supposed.  It is to 'abide forever.' (`Ecclesiastes 1:4`; `Psalm 104:5`.) 'He formed it not in vain; He formed it to be inhabited.' --`Isaiah 45:18`; `66:1`; `60:13`; `35:1,7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WONDERFUL FOREGLEAMS OF LIGHT</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;The most wonderful thing that the Bible tells us respecting that New Day is that it will bring great intelligence and enlightenment to every creature.  The light of the knowledge of the glory of God shall fill the whole earth as the waters cover the face of the great deep. (`Isaiah 11:9`; `Habakkuk 2:14`.)  'And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest, saith the Lord.' (`Jeremiah 31:34`.)  Ultimately every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess, to the glory of God. --`Philippians 2:11`; `Isaiah 45:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;What an enthusing prospect the Bible holds out before the Church and before as many of the world as can exercise a measure of faith to believe!  The world indeed sees to some extent that great blessings are coming; but just what these are and how they are to come mankind know not; for 'the world by wisdom knows not God.' (`1 Corinthians 1:21`.)  The worldly wise have rejected the Bible, and do not trust it as a Revelation from God. Thus the wise are caught in their own craftiness. (`1 Corinthians 3:19`.) Their boasted wisdom ensnares them and blinds them to the Divine Revelation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Nevertheless, some of our greatest thinkers--Mr. Edison and others--are rapidly seeing that the world is just on the verge of the most wonderful inventions and knowledge, which will transform the face of the earth and the people thereof.  They are corroborating the Bible unwittingly; for they believe it not and know not the character of its messages.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Let us not stop now to discuss the darkness of the Night and its weeping.  Let us awake, and take note of the fact that the dawning of the New Age is already here.  For the past forty-two years we have been in it and enjoying many of its blessings.  But those blessings came so stealthily--'like a thief in the night'--that few recognize their import.  Some few have been calling attention to the fact that we have been in the Millennial dawn ever since 1874.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Bible chronology quite clearly teaches that the six thousand years since Adam's creation have ended--six great Days of a thousand years each, mentioned by St. Peter--'a Day with the Lord is as a thousand years.' (`2 Peter 3:8`.)  Now the great Seventh Day, also a thousand years long, has commenced.  We have been enjoying its dawning.  It is to be a grand Day!  What wonder if the dawning be remarkable!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It may surprise some to be told that the past forty-two</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6014 : page 375::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">years mean more to the world in increase of education, increase of wealth, increase of all manner of labor-saving inventions and conveniences, increase of safeguards and protections for human life, than did all the six thousand years which preceded them--many times over.  The world has probably created a thousand times as much wealth during these forty-two years as during the entire six thousand years preceding.  Yet these changes have come so gradually that few have noticed them.</font><br />
<br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Forty-two years ago man labored from sun to sun; today we are rapidly approaching an eight-hour day. Forty-two years ago nearly all the labor of the world was done with sweat of face; today it is nearly all accomplished by machinery.  Forty-two years ago the sewing-machine was just reaching perfection; today it is everywhere indispensable.  So with the thousand household conveniences.  So with nearly all of our sanitary and plumbing arrangements.  So with farming implements. Reapers and binders, mowers, automobiles, gas engines, etc., etc., all belong to these forty-two years.  In our cities the modern conveniences are wonderful.  Solomon in all his glory never even dreamed of such things as the poorest human being in America may enjoy!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Prophecies respecting streams in the desert and the wilderness blossoming as the rose are having fulfilment-- not miraculously, but in harmony with the Divine order of an increased intelligence amongst men.  Artesian wells are being drilled, irrigating canals constructed, not only in the Western part of the United States and Canada, but also in far-off Mesopotamia.  The results are marvelous. Land previously not worth fencing is valued at $500 per acre today.  The increase of knowledge has been supplemented by governmental arrangements for the distribution of that knowledge amongst the people.  The soils of various localities are being analyzed at public expense; and the tillers of the soil are given knowledge as respects what kind of fertilizers are required to bring satisfactory results.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6014 : page 376::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Under these conditions it does not surprise us to know that as much as 156 bushels of corn have been raised to one acre, and that 600 bushels of potatoes and over are not an uncommon record.  Is not the Bible being fulfilled? Who can dispute these facts?  What do they signify?  We answer that they exactly corroborate the Divine declaration which describes our day:  Many shall run to and fro; knowledge shall be increased; the wise of God's people shall understand; and 'there shall be a Time of Trouble such as never was since there was a nation.'--`Daniel 12:4,10,1`; `Matthew 24:21`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">       </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">INCREASE OF WORLD-WIDE DISCONTENT</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;We are in the Morning of our text.  Ah, what a glorious Morning!  How changed the human conditions from those of our grandfathers!  How thankful the whole world should be!  Paeans of praise should be rising from all the people of the favored lands of civilization; and helping hands should be outstretched to carry the same blessings to heathen lands.  But is it so?  Are the people happy and rejoicing?  Are they appreciative of the New Day?--of the gifts of Divine Providence?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;No!  In proportion as the blessings of God have come, the discontent of humanity has increased; and unbelief, not only in respect to the Bible as the Divine Revelation, but in many instances in respect to the very existence of an intelligent Creator.  Notwithstanding the great increase in the world's wealth, and the fact that there are some noble souls who are using their share of the wealth in a praiseworthy manner, nevertheless the general operation of the law of selfishness prevails; and all the legislation which has been enacted, or can be enacted, fails to restrain the giant institutions--corporations --of our day, fails to hinder them from exploiting the masses in the interests of the comparatively few.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Did God know all these things?  What will He do about them?  Will He bring in the Millennial blessings, and risk that men shall take for granted that they have won the secrets of nature by their own wisdom and perseverance, and forget God entirely?  Will they become more discontented?  Would a Millennium of discontent be advantageous?  What will God do about it?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">        </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE DARK NIGHT ALREADY SETTLING</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;According to the Bible, God foreknew the conditions of our day as we are now reviewing them; and in our text He gives a key to the situation--elsewhere in the Scriptures made very plain.  Through the Prophet, God tells of the dark Night coming--after the Morning Dawn had been well ushered in--a dark storm-cloud just at sunrise.  This dark hour is described in the prophecy of Daniel, and also in that of our Lord Jesus, to be 'a Time of Trouble, such as never was since there was a nation.'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Bible students see this great Time of Trouble already beginning in the letting loose of the winds of strife in Europe.  In the light of the Bible they perceive that the result of this present war will be the great weakening of the nations--of the governments of the earth--and increased knowledge and discontent amongst the people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The next phase of the Trouble, according to the Bible, is to be the 'great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.' (`Revelation 16:18`.)  This is not a literal earthquake, but a symbolic one--revolution.  Then the third phase of the calamity--the darkest of all--will be the symbolic fire of anarchy, which will utterly destroy our present civilization.  Then, in the midst of that most awful Time of Trouble, Messiah, the great King, will take His great power and will exercise it, with the result that the raging waves of the sea of human passion will all be quieted, the fires of anarchy will all be extinguished, and the Reign of Righteousness and Peace will begin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">MESSIAH WILL &quot;MAKE ALL THINGS NEW&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Cannot we see the wisdom of the great Creator's Program?  He has determined to permit mankind to convince themselves of their own impotency, of their need of a God, and of the fact that there is a God, and that His glorious purposes for humanity are revealed in His Word.  Ah, it is no wonder that the Bible speaks of that revelation of the Lord as the 'still small voice of God,' speaking to mankind through Messiah's Kingdom!  No wonder the Lord declares that 'then He will turn to the people a pure Message, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him with one consent'!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;St. Peter gives us a vivid picture of the New Order of things in Messiah's Kingdom.  He says, 'The Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up;...the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved....Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.'-- `2 Peter 3:10,12,13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The 'new heavens' will be the glorified Church, consisting of Jesus the Head and His Bride class, selected from the world during the past eighteen centuries.  The 'new earth' will be the new social order under the control of the new heavens.  There will be no patching of present institutions, but a clean sweep of them by the fire of Divine wrath preceding the establishment of the New Order, wherein only that which is righteous, just, equitable, true, will be recognized.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We rejoice that such glorious things are coming-- even though the world must necessarily reach them through the tribulation of the Time of Trouble.  Happy are those whose eyes and ears of understanding are open now, and who are in such heart relationship with the Lord that He can make known to them in advance something of the riches of His grace, and show them how the coming troubles will work out blessings for the human family.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PASTOR RUSSELL'S CHARACTER</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In this dark hour upon the nations let the peoples of the earth hear this message and heed it as one from the Lord.  For forty years Pastor Russell has set forth in his writings that this dark hour would come soon.  He reached this conclusion based upon the Word of the Lord.  Behold, it is fully confirmed by the events we see.  Let the Christian people of the earth, therefore, awake to the importance of the hour and heed the message--&quot;THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND!&quot;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;Arise and shine; for thy light is come and the</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     glory of the Lord is arisen upon thee.&quot;--`Isaiah 60:1`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Enemies?  Yes; he had some--God pity them!  Jesus had enemies who relentlessly persecuted Him.  I would not mar this occasion by reference to the enemies of Pastor Russell, but I know that he would be glad for me to speak anything that would help to open the eyes of understanding of those who are blinded to God's purposes.  Blind prejudice, based upon false accusations of enemies, has tended to keep some in the dark.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truly it can be said that Pastor Russell's character was and is without blemish.  He was the cleanest, purest and best man I ever knew.  His enemies sought to make him of no reputation.  By insinuation--the most cruel of weapons--they sought to destroy his power and influence, and hence his work.  They utterly failed.  I feel constrained, under the circumstances, to read to you a paper signed by Pastor Russell.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the year 1911 he was starting on a trip around the world.  At that time the fiery darts from the enemy were coming thick and fast.  He wrote out this instrument, made oath to it, and placed it in my hands, saying, &quot;You may</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   But persecutions only stirred him to greater efforts in the cause of the King of kings, knowing, as he did, that such persecutions are evidences that the night is drawing on when no man can work.  Without murmur or complaint, early and late, in winter and in summer, in heat and in cold, in season and out of season, amidst storms and in sunshine, as a mighty giant he fought on to the goal, never faltering or looking back.  Truly, he died a hero, and died in the harness!  &quot;Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.&quot;  Truly at the close of his earthly career, as such a hero, he could say:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;I have fought my way through;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     I have finished the work</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The work that Pastor Russell did was not his work alone, but it was and is the Lord's work.  It was Jesus who said that at His coming He would gird Himself and cause His servants to sit down at meat; and that He would come forth and serve them.--`Luke 12:37`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For forty years the Lord has been present, feeding those who have been hungering and thirsting for righteousness. For forty years Pastor Russell--that faithful servant of the Lord--has set forth clear and unmistakable evidence of the presence of the Master.  He nailed the banner of Christ's presence on the title page of THE WATCH TOWER; and it shall never come down until the Kingdom is known in the earth.  The flood of Present Truth has been rising for more than forty years, and it is rising higher and higher.  As well might the enemies of the Truth seek with a common broom to sweep back the waves of the mighty Atlantic as to try to suppress the flood of Truth that is rising now.  In spite of all the opposition that can be brought to bear, it will continue to rise until, as the Prophet declares, &quot;the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth as the waters fill the deep&quot;; until such time as it will not be necessary for any man to teach his neighbor, saying, Know ye the Lord; for all shall know Him, from the least unto the greatest.&quot;--`Isa. 11:9`; `Jer. 31:34`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The thousands of Christian men and women in the earth today who have fought by the side of Pastor Russell have not been blindly following him.  They have followed the Lord; they have followed Pastor Russell only as he followed the Lord.  Recognizing him as the special servant of the Lord, they have fought by his side as his brethren, looking to Jesus, the Captain of their salvation; and having thus started in the fight, they will fight on until every one of the Kingdom class has gained the victory.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I cannot pass this moment without paying a personal tribute to Pastor Russell.  He was my friend, and a true friend indeed.  It is written, &quot;A true friend loves you all the time.&quot;  I loved him; I know he loved me.  Long before I knew Pastor Russell, he had done much for me. While I was engaged in the law practice in the Middle West, there came into my office one day a lady, bearing some books in her arms.  She was modest, gentle and kind. I thought she was poor, and that it was my privilege and duty to help her.  I found that she was rich in faith in God.  I bought the books and afterwards read them.  Up to that time I knew nothing about the Bible; I had never heard of Pastor Russell.  I did not even know that he was the author of the books at the time I read them; but I know that the wonderfully sweet, harmonious explanation of the Plan of God thrilled my heart and changed the course of my life from doubt to joy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Why should not I love him?  I know that he loved me. A little incident illustrates this: Several years ago he requested me to go on a mission of importance.  After talking with him I said, &quot;Brother Russell, I feel that I cannot do it.&quot;  He answered, &quot;Yes you can, by the Lord's grace.&quot;  I said, &quot;I am willing to try.&quot;  &quot;Go on,&quot; he replied, &quot;and I will pray God to give you the wisdom.&quot;  &quot;I went&quot;; and having succeeded far beyond my expectations I returned and gave him a report.  Seated in his study, as I went over the report in detail, his face lighted up with joy; and like a loving father he rose and put his arms around me, drew me to him and kissed me, saying, &quot;Brother, I love you very much.&quot;  I have walked with him; I have talked with him; I have eaten with him; I have slept with him; I have been with him through trials and triumphs; I have seen him in storm and in sunshine.  Amidst all of these I have marked his complete joy in the Lord, his magnanimous heart, and his absolute loyalty and devotion to the Lord and to His cause.  Gentle, kind, fearless and affectionate, magnanimous, sincere and filled with the spirit of the Lord, he was a giant of power in the world. I count it the greatest honor that I have known to have had Pastor Russell for my true and loyal friend, and that I have been privileged to be associated with him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I will relate to you an incident that throws some light on his sweet relationship with the Lord.  For more than a year prior to his death he suffered a great deal of physical pain, yet never did he murmur.  His great desire was to have the approval of the Lord and Master.  He spoke the Master's name in loving terms, and his face lighted when he mentioned the Lord.  A few weeks prior to this last illness, speaking to one whom he loved very dearly and in whom he had great confidence, he said, &quot;I have had such a longing desire to be embraced by the Lord Jesus, to think of myself as the woman, or bride, and to have the Master press me to His bosom.  I have prayed earnestly to the Lord that I might experience this sweet relationship, and He has given me this assurance that I do enjoy that sweet relationship.&quot;  Truly the Lord loved him much! Truly for him to live was for Christ to live!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's Book is written for those who are loyal to Him. His promises are to such.  Among these sweet promises are the words of the Master: &quot;Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life.&quot;  &quot;These shall be kings and priests unto God and unto Christ and shall reign with Him.&quot;  Long ago God caused the Sweet Singer to record in His holy Book, concerning the faithful and loyal followers of Christ Jesus, these sweet words:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;The king shall joy in Thy strength, O Lord: and in Thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice.  Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.  For Thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness; Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.  He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest it him, even length of days forever and ever.  His glory is great in Thy salvation; honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him, for Thou hast made him most blessed forever; Thou hast made him exceeding glad with Thy countenance.&quot;--`Psalm 21:1-6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truly these words fittingly apply to our beloved Brother and Pastor!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Charles Taze Russell, thou hast, by the Lord, been crowned a king; and through the everlasting ages thy name shall be known amongst the people, and thy enemies shall come and worship at thy feet.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We take the last view of this piece of clay that so faithfully bore the banner of the King.  He has been a true, loyal, faithful ambassador of Christ.  Thanks be to God, he has entered into his everlasting reward.  The greatest desire of our lives is that we, together with him, may soon be forever with the Lord and participate in blessing all the families of the earth.  God help us, as we here renew our consecration, to keep it faithfully to the end.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We sorrow not for him who has gone, because we know he has entered into his everlasting joy.  For him we rejoice; but we sorrow for ourselves.  Yet trusting in the Lord we will continue to fight the good fight of faith.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   My beloved brethren--we who are here, and all who are in the earth--what shall we do?  Shall we slacken our zeal for the cause of our Lord and King?  No!  By His grace we will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">increase</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our zeal and energy, to finish our course with joy.  We will not fear nor falter, but will stand shoulder to shoulder, contending for the faith, rejoicing in our privilege of proclaiming the Message of His Kingdom. He has promised, &quot;I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.&quot;  &quot;Faithful is He that calleth, who also will do it.&quot;  Then why should we for one moment doubt the outcome of His work and His cause!  True, the enemy of death has taken from us at a time when we did not expect it, our beloved Brother; and for this cause we are bowed down.  Yet we are not dismayed, we are not discouraged. Let us lift up our heads and rejoice, for surely our deliverance draweth nigh!  &quot;THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Today we are beholding the death throes of the nations of earth; we are standing at the portals of the Golden Age.  Everyone who has accepted the Truth of God's Plan, in the love of the Truth, and who holds fast in that spirit, will win.  Let everyone look well to his Armor. Let us gird up the loins of our minds, be sober and hope to the end.  He who has led us thus far will lead us on. Remember, he who is faithful </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unto death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall receive the Crown of Life.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The evening oration, the reading of Brother Russell's sermon which he himself had prepared to deliver in the Temple that evening, and the sweet strains of several hymns were still fresh in the minds of the vast audience when the pall-bearers carried forth from The Temple the casket containing the remains of our dear Brother Russell. Accompanying the body to Pittsburgh were two Pullman cars loaded with devoted and faithful friends, who were met by hundreds of loved ones at that place.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The large auditorium of the Carnegie Library in Allegheny was packed at two o'clock the following afternoon, when the fourth part of the funeral services began under the direction of Dr. W.E. Spill, representing the Pittsburgh congregation.  Love and deep interest were written upon every face in this vast audience also.  Every available space on the platform was used to display the rich floral offerings of every description sent by Bible Students and friends from various sections of the country.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The blending of the voices composing the double quartette in their rendition of sweet Christian hymns was the means of conveying blessings of comfort and encouragement to many sorrowing hearts.  After the reading of the Holy Scriptures by Brother R.E. Bricker, also of the Pittsburgh Ecclesia, Dr. W.E. Spill delivered an address. He was followed by Brother Sturgeon, after which, while the congregation was taking its final view of the face of that noble Christian lying before them, the choir sang the last song given out by Brother Russell during his recent visit to Los Angeles:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;Abide sweet Spirit, Heavenly Dove,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     With light and comfort from Above;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     Be Thou our Guardian, Thou our Guide,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     O'er every thought and step preside.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The funeral cortege consisted of 101 automobiles and a train of several trolley cars.  The beautiful Rosemont Cemetery was reached at dusk, where a company of five hundred friends were gathered on the hillside to witness the last sad rites in connection with the placing of our loved one in the grave.  An avenue lined with flowers was formed, through which came the mourners with bared heads, bearing solemnly the casket containing the remains of our Pastor.  The walls of the grave were lined with ferns and white chrysanthemums.  At the foot of the grave was a floral design inlaid with colors of gold, which silently expressed the belief that the victorious Christian soldier, whose body lay before us, had gone home, and was now a partaker of the Divine nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While the bier rested upon the supports over the open grave, prayer was offered, and the casket was lowered to its last resting place, during which the choir impressively sang the beautiful words of Hymn No. 98.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was fitting that while our Beloved had gone to be forever with the Lord and like Him, his remains should rest near the scenes of his earlier days, where the Harvest work began, and where the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, which contributed much to his fame, were written and first circulated.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   [The Harvest Work, of which Pastor Russell was the leading spirit in the world for more than forty years, was and is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> work.  The friends everywhere recognize this.  The great number of letters daily received from all parts of the land, since Brother Russell's death, clearly manifest the loyalty of the dear brethren to the cause of Messiah's Kingdom and evidence their determination to press forward along the mark for the Prize of the High Calling.  The Society greatly appreciates these assurances of full cooperation in the Lord's work. What a great incentive to renewed zeal, courage and faithfulness!  We give a few samples of these letters below.  Others will be published from time to time in THE WATCH TOWER as space will permit:]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">               </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AT THE GRAVE SIDE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BRETHREN IN CHRIST:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon a hillside, sloping towards the south, we gathered round about upon that hallowed ground to pay our last sad tribute to the one we loved, the greatest man on earth in these last days--and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">great</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because he was approved of God! How ineffable the beauty of the scene!  So peaceful and so still!  The gently rolling hills, far as the eye can reach, reminding us that, &quot;As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people from henceforth, even forever.&quot;  A violet mist creeps softly through the valleys at our feet, and faintly dims the City's distant lights.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The sacred silence is broken only by the singing of our choir, like angel voices floating out upon the evening air:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;How vain is all beneath the skies!</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     How transient every earthly bliss!</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     How slender all the fondest ties</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     That bind us to a world like this!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Above the purple haze, and low within the western sky, the last faint, crimson glow of sunset slowly pales into the silvery whiteness that precedes the night.  And lo! the evening star!  How like </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a star was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our beloved!  And how he shed the rays of Truth divine into the darkness of our minds and changed that darkness to &quot;His marvelous light!&quot;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;The evening cloud, the morning dew,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          The withering grass, the fading flower,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     Of earthly hopes are emblems true,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          The glory of a passing hour.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How exquisitely expressive of all about us!  The withered grass beneath our feet, the fading flowers upon the upturned earth, and here and there the bare, brown trees, a few crisp leaves still faintly fluttering on their boughs.  Their fruit has all been gathered, and they speak to us of harvest soon to end. &quot;In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.&quot;  Did our beloved Pastor bear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">much fruit?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Ah, yes!  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">How</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> much, he now may know as he hath never fully known before!</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;But, though earth's fairest blossoms die,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          And all beneath the skies is vain,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     There is a brighter age now nigh,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          Beyond the reach of care and pain.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6016 : page 379::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   And standing there, our hearts rejoiced with joy unspeakable that in His infinite love and mercy the Lord had not permitted that most precious clay to suffer violence, but, &quot;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him,&quot; and He saved us from the anguish which might have been greater than </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could bear!  Yet he suffered-- how greatly God only knows, for he never murmured or complained; but he suffered not by hands of wicked men, and so we rendered thanks to God!</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;Then let the hope of joys to come</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          Dispel our cares, and chase our fears,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     Since God is ours, we're traveling home,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though passing through a vale of tears!</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With eyelids closed, and sorrowing hearts, we bowed our heads in final prayer with one who also loved and labored with him to the end.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R6017 : page 379::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   And then in silent little groups the friends departed from the scene, and as we climbed the hill to reach the road, the moon shone full upon us.  Ah, yes!  The full moon of God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">favor,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and our hearts cried out, &quot;How long, O God, until the night shall come, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">night</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wherein no man can work!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One last and lingering look upon the scene recalled to mind that wonderful picture, &quot;The Return from Calvary,&quot; with its three crosses faintly outlined on the evening sky, and the sorrowful women wending their way towards Jerusalem.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And now it had grown strangely dark, no object was discernible on either side the road, as we, the Lord's still faithful followers of these later days, were swiftly borne towards the city of our beloved leader's birth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How wondrously appropriate all had been!  The suggestion of the Harvest soon to end, the ingathering of the ripened fruits, the softly falling twilight, like a curtain dropped upon the scene, and now the darkness and loneliness of the flock of sheep whose faithful shepherd had been &quot;smitten!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How necessary now to walk still more &quot;by faith&quot; in the Great Shepherd of us all, the One who is &quot;too wise to err, too good to be unkind;&quot; &quot;who doeth all things well.&quot;  Be brave, be strong, weep not, have faith in God!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It is the LORD, let Him do what seemeth Him good!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;Faith can firmly trust Him,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          Come what may!&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We, the Pittsburgh Congregation of Associated Bible Students, deeply mourn the death of our Beloved Pastor, who has lovingly and faithfully served us for so many years.  In loving consideration of his high honor and noble Christian character, his untiring labors on behalf of the Lord's people both here and elsewhere, his many noble sacrifices and patient endurance of much persecution on behalf of the Lord's Truth, his devoted faithfulness to the Lord and to the Lord's Word under every condition of trial; therefore, be it resolved,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BRETHREN:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have received and read with interest and care your valued letter of the 9th inst., and thoroughly appreciate the spirit of fellowship and consideration manifested.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am in full harmony with the judgment of the Editorial Committee and the Board of Directors that all the Editorial Staff should be in close personal touch, and not being situated so that I can take up my residence in Brooklyn, I hereby tender my resignation from the Editorial Staff to be effective at once.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that there are able brethren on the ground, and nominated by our dear Pastor, who are probably more fully equipped than I to carry on the work outlined in the Will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I know it is unnecessary for me to say that I am in the closest and warmest head and heart sympathy and fellowship with all the work delegated to the various departments of the Society, and shall hold myself in readiness to respond to every opportunity for service that I can discern or you can designate.

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RITCHIE:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In harmony with the Will of our dear Brother Russell, a copy of which I received, together with your letter of the 3rd inst., I am addressing you and through you the other members of the Editorial Staff of THE WATCH TOWER.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While I love the Lord and His people devotedly, and while I would greatly appreciate the privilege of serving as a member of the Editorial staff of THE WATCH TOWER, I am compelled because of conditions to decline to accept such place.  As you know I was a member of the Bethel Family at the time Brother Russell added my name in his Will to the Editorial staff; that for more than a year past I have not been a member of the Bethel Family and am not now, because it became necessary for me to take a position in the world to earn a living for my family.  After prayer and due consideration, I believe it to be in harmony with the Lord's will that I decline to accept the position assigned to me by the Will of our dear Brother Russell, and I therefore decline to accept the same.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I offer my resignation, humbly awaiting the Lord's leading. Should you at a later time, by reason of vacancy in the Editorial staff, understand it to be the Lord's will and in harmony with the provisions of Brother Russell's last Will that I serve, I hope and pray, by the Lord's grace, that I will be ready to respond fully and promptly.  Again craving an interest in your prayers,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BRETHREN:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At a meeting of our Church this evening, I was requested by a unanimous vote to express to you as best I can the sorrow of heart under which we are laboring, because of the death of our faithful and Beloved Pastor; and to assure you of our desire and determination to cooperate heartily, in our feeble way, with those who shall have the privilege and responsibility of supervising and directing the Harvest Work during what we believe will be but a brief period before the coming storm shall burst upon us in all its fierceness and fury.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As to our deep sorrow, let us say that it is not an unmixed sorrow; for while we shall no more see his dear face, and no more hear his wise and loving words of godly instruction, his exhortations to holiness of life, and his fatherly counsel, yet we rejoice that his sufferings are forever past, that his unremitting toils are over, and that the scorpion-tongue of vituperation, slander and vilification can never again reach and give pain to his great, loving, tender heart.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His example of self-sacrificing loyalty to God, the Truth and the Church, his patience, perseverance and indefatigable zeal, the sweetness of his spirit, his freedom from animosity and resentment under the most cruel and malignant persecution, will ever remain an incentive to us to emulate him in the attainment of these fruits of the Spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truly the memory of him is most precious, and redolent of the richest perfume.  Truly may we, without irreverence, apply the words of the poet to him:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;Long, long be my heart</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          With such memories filled,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     Like the vase in which roses</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          Have once been distilled;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     You may break, you may shatter</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          The vase if you will,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     But the scent of the roses</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          Will cling to it still.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our hearts join yours in sympathy at the taking away of our beloved Brother and Pastor Russell.  How sorrowful it is to be separated from the one we love so dearly!  Our hearts cannot help being filled with sorrow for the loss of this faithful servant of the Lord, who so much loved us as to lay down his life in our behalf.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we &quot;sorrow not as others that have no hope.&quot;  When we think of his many years of toil and suffering patiently endured for the sake of his Master, when we think of the bitter persecution by relentless foes inside and outside of the Church, the befouling of his good name, and the besmirching of his good reputation, we rejoice greatly to know that his great tribulation has forever ended.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, our sorrow is displaced by joy when we contemplate the glorious exaltation that is his.  We know that he is not &quot;asleep&quot; in death, but &quot;changed&quot; and &quot;raised incorruptible&quot; --&quot;caught up&quot; &quot;to meet the Lord,&quot; and so shall he ever be with the Lord.  Yes, we acclaim, &quot;Blessed&quot; are you, dear Brother; you are at rest from your labors and your work follows with you.&quot;--`1 Cor. 15:51,52`; `1 Thes. 4:17`; `Rev. 14:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How we all the more long for the time when we shall similarly have finished our course with joy and been ushered into the presence of our adorable Lord together with His saints!  Meantime it is ours to press on with renewed zeal until the work be done and we at last receive the crown.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We anticipate your increased responsibilities, dear brethren, and we pray the necessary increase of the Lord's Spirit upon you in carrying on the work of the ministry.</font><br />

As the dear brethren carried the silent form of our Beloved Pastor past us at the Carnegie Hall (Allegheny), yesterday, he seemed to say to us in hushed silence, &quot;What more can I say than to you I have said?&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear Brethren, we desire to extend our sympathies to all who are engaged at the Brooklyn Tabernacle, and to express our appreciation of your resolution to continue in the service of the Glad Tidings of the Kingdom.  We assure you of our cooperation.  We will therefore continue to look to the Lord, to cast our cares upon Him and to pray for you, as we have for our Beloved Pastor.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are indeed glad to know that our dear Pastor had so arranged the affairs of the W.T.B. &amp; T. Society that in the event of his death, the work would be carried on without interruption.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our hearts indeed go out to each and every one of you, and we can assure you that we will cooperate with you in the future as we have in the past.  We shall also continue to remember you in our prayers daily.  We pray that you will also continue to remember us daily in your prayers.  We also hope we may be served from time to time by the dear Pilgrim brethren, and that we may continue to share in the Harvest work under your direction.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Last Wednesday evening the Class by unanimous vote decided that in the future all Elders and Deacons should answer the V.D.M. Questions, and their answers should be passed upon by the Committee appointed by Brother Russell.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Elders here have been slow in sending their answers to these questions, not because of not being in harmony with them, but because some have not had the time; others did not have the questions, and others were timid about asking for them, until the class expressed their wish in the matter. All expect to have their answers mailed to you within the next two weeks.               HOUSTON CHURCH.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Texas.</font></b><br />

He has stood as a finger-board at the cross-roads of confusion, pointing us the true way as he for many years endured the chilling blasts of persecution from a cold, unthinking clergy and their following.  Thank God for his ministrations of love and for the privilege of being associated with him!</font><br />

We thank God for the love of a true brother in Christ, for the spiritual and material aid rendered without thought of self, for the wonderful privilege of being enlightened to know the riches of the inheritance in Christ, to appreciate the hope of the High Calling, to gain a heart knowledge of the love of Christ in its lengths, breadths, heights and depths.  We sorrow as over the passing of our best earthly friend and benefactor, but we rejoice with joy unspeakable as we celebrate in our hearts the first Heavenly birthday of our beloved Pastor Russell. And now to God be the glory, the honor and the praise for all that He hath wrought in us all through this much beloved one whose face we all hope soon to see, shining in the light of immortality.
