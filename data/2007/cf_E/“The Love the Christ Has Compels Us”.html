The apostle Paul answers: “The love the Christ has compels us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>) In this section we will study the love that Jesus has​—for Jehovah, for mankind, and for us as individuals. Such a study is truly compelling. Our hearts are touched, and we feel compelled to act, to make progress in following our Master’s example.</p>
