He said: “I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 10:14</a>) Do you truly know the Fine Shepherd​—his qualities, his message and work, his zeal, his love? This book will help you to know Jesus more intimately and to follow him more closely.</p>
