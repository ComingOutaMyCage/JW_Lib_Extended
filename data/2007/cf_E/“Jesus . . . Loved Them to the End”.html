<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">AS HE gathers his apostles in an upper room of a house in Jerusalem, Jesus knows that this is his last evening with them. The time is near for him to return to his Father. In a matter of hours, Jesus will be arrested and his faith tested as never before. Yet, not even his impending death can distract him from the needs of the apostles.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jesus has prepared the apostles for his departure, but he still has more to say to strengthen them for what lies ahead. So he spends these last precious moments teaching them vital lessons that will help them to remain faithful. His words are among the warmest and most intimate that he has ever shared with them. Why, though, is Jesus more concerned about his apostles than about himself? Why are these final hours with them so dear to him? The answer is, in a word, love. His love for them is profound.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 3. How do we know that Jesus did not wait until his final evening to show love to his followers?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Decades later when introducing his inspired account of the events of that evening, the apostle John wrote: “Because he knew before the festival of the passover that his hour had come for him to move out of this world to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own that were in the world, loved them to the end.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:1-43:13:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 13:1</a>) Jesus did not wait until that night to demonstrate love to “his own.” Throughout his ministry, in ways large and small, he gave proof of his love for his disciples. We do well to examine some of <span id="page162" class="pageNum" data-no="162" data-before-text="162"></span>the ways he showed his love, for by imitating him in this regard, we prove ourselves his genuine disciples.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">4, 5. (a) Why did Jesus need patience in dealing with his disciples? (b) How did Jesus respond when three of his apostles showed a lack of vigilance in the garden of Gethsemane?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Love and patience go together. “Love is long-suffering,” observes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>, and long-suffering involves patiently putting up with others. Did Jesus need patience in dealing with his disciples? Indeed, he did! As we saw in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102007044/">Chapter 3</a>, the apostles were slow to cultivate humility. More than once, they got into arguments about who was the greatest among them. How did Jesus react? Did he get angry and respond with irritation or resentment? No, he patiently reasoned with them, even when “a heated dispute” over this issue arose on his last evening with them!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:24-42:22:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:24-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:20-40:20:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 20:20-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:33-41:9:37" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Mark 9:33-37</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Later on that final night, when Jesus went to the garden of Gethsemane with the 11 faithful apostles, his patience was tested yet again. Leaving eight of the apostles, Jesus took Peter, James, and John deeper into the garden. “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death,” Jesus told them. “Stay here and keep on the watch.” He went a short distance away and began praying fervently. After praying at length, he returned to the three apostles. What did he find? In this, his hour of greatest trial, they were fast asleep! Did he berate them for their lack of vigilance? No, he patiently exhorted them. His kind words showed an understanding of the stress they had been under and of their weaknesses.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> “The spirit, of course, is eager,” he said, “but the flesh is <span id="page163" class="pageNum" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span>weak.” Jesus remained patient that evening, even when he came and found them asleep not one but two more times!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:36-40:26:46" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 26:36-46</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. How can we imitate Jesus in our dealings with others?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>It is encouraging to note that Jesus did not give up on his apostles. His patience eventually bore fruit, for these faithful men learned the importance of being both humble and vigilant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:7-60:4:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4:7</a>) How can we imitate Jesus in our dealings with others? Elders especially need to exercise patience. Fellow believers may approach an elder with their problems when the elder himself is tired out or distracted by his own concerns. At times, those in need of help may be slow to respond to counsel. Nevertheless, patient elders will instruct “with mildness” and will “treat the flock with tenderness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:29" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 20:28, 29</a>) Parents also do well to imitate Jesus in showing patience, for at times children may be slow to respond to counsel or correction. Love and patience will help parents not to give up in their efforts to train their children. The rewards of such patience can be great indeed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Love is evidenced by unselfish deeds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 3:17, 18</a>) It “does not look for its own interests.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>) Love moved Jesus to care for the physical and material needs of his disciples. He often acted in their behalf even before they voiced their needs. When he saw that they were tired, he suggested that they accompany him “privately into a lonely place and rest up a bit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:31-41:6:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 6:31</a>) When he sensed that they were hungry, he took the initiative to feed them​—along with thousands of others who had come to hear him teach.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:19-40:14:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 14:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:35-40:15:37" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 15:35-37</a>.</p>

The Sermon on the Mount was delivered especially for the benefit of his disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:1-40:5:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 5:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:13-40:5:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 13-16</a>) When he taught with illustrations, “privately to his disciples he would explain all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:34-41:4:34" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 4:34</a>) Jesus foretold that he would appoint a “faithful and discreet slave” to ensure that His followers would be well-fed spiritually during the last days. This faithful slave, composed of a small group of Jesus’ spirit-anointed brothers on earth, has been providing spiritual “food at the proper time” ever since 1919 C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>On the day of his death, Jesus showed in a touching way <span id="page165" class="pageNum" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span>his concern for the spiritual welfare of his loved ones. Picture the scene. Jesus was on the stake, suffering excruciating pain. In order to draw breath, he evidently had to push himself up with his feet. This no doubt caused him severe pain as the weight of his body tore at the nail wounds in his feet and his scourged back rubbed against the stake. Speech, which involves breath control, must have been difficult and painful. Yet, just before he died, Jesus spoke words that showed his deep love for his mother, Mary. Seeing Mary and the apostle John standing nearby, Jesus, in a voice loud enough for bystanders to hear, said to his mother: “Woman, see! Your son!” Then to John, he said: “See! Your mother!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:26-43:19:27" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 19:26, 27</a>) Jesus knew that the faithful apostle would care not just for Mary’s physical and material needs but also for her spiritual welfare.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Forgiveness is a facet of love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:14" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13, 14</a>) Love “does not keep account of the injury,” states <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>. On a number of occasions, Jesus taught his followers the importance of forgiveness. He urged them to forgive others “not, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy-seven times”​—that is, an unlimited number of times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:21-40:18:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 18:21, 22</a>) He taught them that a sinner should be forgiven if upon being rebuked, he shows repentance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:3-42:17:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 17:3, 4</a>) Jesus, however, was not like the hypocritical Pharisees, who taught by word only; he also taught by example. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:2-40:23:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 23:2-4</a>) Let us see how Jesus demonstrated his willingness to forgive even when a trusted friend let him down.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Jesus had a close relationship with the apostle Peter, <span id="page168" class="pageNum" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>a warmhearted man who at times was impulsive. Jesus recognized the good qualities of Peter and extended special privileges to him. Peter, along with James and John, personally witnessed certain miracles that the rest of the 12 did not get to see. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 17:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:49-42:8:55" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 8:49-55</a>) As we noted earlier, Peter was one of the apostles who accompanied Jesus farther into the garden of Gethsemane on the night of His arrest. Yet, that same night when Jesus was betrayed and taken into custody, Peter and the other apostles abandoned Jesus and fled. Later, Peter proved brave enough to stand outside while Jesus was illegally tried. Still, Peter then became fearful and made a serious mistake​—three times he lyingly denied that he even knew Jesus! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:69-40:26:75" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 26:69-75</a>) How did Jesus react? How would you have responded if a close friend let you down in such a way?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jesus was prepared to forgive Peter. He knew that Peter was crushed by the weight of his sin. After all, the repentant apostle “broke down and gave way to weeping.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:72-41:14:72" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mark 14:72</a>) On the day of His resurrection, Jesus appeared to Peter, likely to comfort and reassure the apostle.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:14-44:2:40" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 2:14-40</a>) Let us remember, too, that Jesus did not hold a grudge against the apostles as a group for abandoning him. On the contrary, after his resurrection, he still called them “my brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:10-40:28:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 28:10</a>) Is it not clear that Jesus did more than just preach forgiveness?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:25-41:11:25" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mark 11:25</a>) How, then, can we demonstrate a readiness to forgive those who may sin against us?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:8</a>) When those who have wronged us are sincerely repentant, as Peter was, surely we want to imitate Jesus’ willingness to forgive.

He had confidence in them and believed that at heart they really loved Jehovah and wanted to do His will. Even when they made mistakes, Jesus did not question their motives. For example, when the apostles James and John evidently got their mother to request that they sit beside Jesus in his Kingdom, Jesus did not doubt their loyalty or dismiss them as apostles.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:20-40:20:28" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 20:20-28</a>.</p>

They took care of obtaining the lamb, wine, unleavened bread, bitter greens, and any other necessary items. This was no menial assignment, for celebrating the Passover in the proper manner was a requirement of the Mosaic Law, and Jesus had to live up to that Law. Besides, later that evening Jesus used the wine and the unleavened bread as important symbols when instituting the Memorial of his death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:17-40:26:19" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 26:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:8-42:22:8" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Luke 22:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:13-42:22:13" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>
