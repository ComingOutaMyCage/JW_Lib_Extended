00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
For more than 100 years,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
have proclaimed the Bible’s message

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:12.095 line:10% position:50% align:center
that God’s Kingdom

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
will rid the world of wickedness,

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.766 line:10% position:50% align:center
restore the earth to Paradise,

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and raise mankind to perfection.

00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:22.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing this truth, however,

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:25.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
has often resulted in persecution

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:28.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
from powerful institutions.

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why has such a positive message

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
elicited such a negative reaction?

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:37.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how have we overcome that opposition

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to where we are today?

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the story of a people

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
intent on living in the light of Bible truth,

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:48.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what hostility they may face.

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:51.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch, note the determination

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s modern-day servants

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:56.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study diligently, preach zealously,

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep serving God faithfully.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
This video is more than just history.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is your story.

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:07.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a reminder that Jehovah God

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:09.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in full control

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that this is his organization.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a story that begins

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 6,000 years ago

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.465 line:10% position:50% align:center
—the story of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:37.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible, light is associated with truth,

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:41.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas darkness
is associated with falsehood<b>.</b>

00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:51.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
When God completed his creative works,

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:54.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was no spiritual darkness.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after Adam and Eve sinned,

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
human society
came under the control of Satan.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shunning the light

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
would become
the foremost goal of wicked people.

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:16.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone seeking truth in such a world
would be opposed.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
The light of truth shone brightly

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:26.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus Christ walked the earth.

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:33.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
All who truly followed Jesus
reflected the light he radiated.

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus foretold
that after the death of his apostles,

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
there would be
a falling away from pure worship.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
That apostasy would be so extensive

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
that genuine disciples
would practically disappear

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.123 line:10% position:50% align:center
until “the conclusion

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:56.159 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the system of things.”

00:02:56.993 --> 00:02:59.028 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:02.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
a counterfeit form of Christianity
would flourish.

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it happened.

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
So-called Christian churches
deviated from Christ’s teachings.

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result was
the abuse of power

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and untold suffering.

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a period of deep darkness.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:46.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the centuries after the establishment
of the Christian congregation,

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see how many of those

00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:49.579 line:10% position:50% align:center
who were taking the lead

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.680 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Christian church

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.282 line:10% position:50% align:center
(or, the Christian congregation)

00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:55.919 line:10% position:50% align:center
likewise started to love worldly wisdom.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
These ideas that came from Plato
and other Greek philosophers

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:04.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to infiltrate
the so-called Christian thinking.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.696 line:10% position:50% align:center
And so the apostates

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:08.998 line:10% position:50% align:center
wished to blend

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:12.635 line:10% position:50% align:center
Christian teaching and Christian tradition

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
with pagan religious ideas.

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:20.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The idea was to make these things
more acceptable to other pagans

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that pagans could be drawn
into the Christian religion.

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:27.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the centuries passed<b>,</b>

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
apostate religious leaders
obscured the light even further

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping the Bible in Latin,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
a language no longer understood
by most people.

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:41.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, at certain points during this darkness,

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were still individuals

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:47.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
who felt keenly the need
to read and understand God’s Word.

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:51.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the 1100’s,

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
a French merchant known as Vaudès

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
commissioned a translation of Bible books
into the language of the common people.

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:01.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two centuries later<b>,</b>

00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:03.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Catholic priest John Wycliffe
wrote powerfully

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
against unbiblical practices of the church.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
I demand you explain yourself!

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:11.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1382, Wycliffe’s team

00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:14.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
released the first translation
of the Bible into English.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:19.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
His students, known as Lollards,

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
preached the Bible’s message
to anyone who would listen.

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:30.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1495, the invention of movable type

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:32.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
made it possible
to print all or part of the Bible

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:34.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 12 languages.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our Father which art in heaven . . . “

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:39.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, people were reading it for themselves.

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:44.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some who did began to discern

00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:47.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the church had gone off course.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1500’s, such men as Huldrych Zwingli,

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martin Luther,

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and John Calvin

00:05:57.507 --> 00:06:02.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
preached the need to return
to the original principles of Christianity.

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:05.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men and others

00:06:05.715 --> 00:06:08.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
tried to expose hypocritical practices

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and uphold Bible teachings,

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:13.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though this put them at odds

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
with powerful religious authorities.

00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:18.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see ones

00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were willing
to stand out as being different

00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:23.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they didn’t have
a full knowledge of the truth.

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
But standing out led to persecution,

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:35.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persecution often led to compromise,

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:39.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when it came to preaching.

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:46.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, in many lands,

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 1600’s and 1700’s

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:51.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
were marked
by a strong upsurge in Bible study.

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:57.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
In England, many learned men

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
refuted the Trinity doctrine as unscriptural,

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
among them scientist Sir Isaac Newton,

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:07.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
poet John Milton,

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:09.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chemist Joseph Priestley.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides rejecting the Trinity doctrine,

00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Priestley declared that the teaching

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:18.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the inherent immortality of the soul
was false<b>.</b>

00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:22.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
He held that the first-century Christians
had the true faith

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:26.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that any change to that pattern of belief
was a corruption.

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
His opinions sparked a heated controversy

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both in the church and in the government.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1791,

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:43.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
a mob destroyed
Priestley’s house and laboratory.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
The pressure mounted for three more years

00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:50.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
until he fled to the United States.

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was followed
by many others who held his views,

00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:58.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
among them Henry Grew<b>.</b>

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:02.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1807, at age 25,

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:05.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grew was invited to serve as pastor

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:07.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Baptist Church
in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had a very interesting philosophy
on the study of the Bible:

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let Scripture interpret Scripture.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:22.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grew’s point was that the Bible

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:25.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
was its own best interpreter.

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as he studied the Bible,
he began to realize

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the doctrine of the Trinity was false.

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:35.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you couldn’t be a Baptist minister
and not believe in the Trinity.

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:38.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
After four years,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grew and several others
withdrew from the church.

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:48.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
In later years, Grew published writings
in which he used the Bible

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:51.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
to refute the Trinity, hellfire,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the inherent immortality of the soul<b>.</b>

00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:59.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Grew argued that immortality
according to the Bible

00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a gift that God bestows on the faithful.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:08.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not a gift
that he bestows on the wicked.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how could the wicked
have an immortal soul?

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:21.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grew’s pamphlet
would have far-reaching effects.

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:29.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
His work caught the attention
of Methodist minister George Storrs<b>.</b>

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Intrigued, Storrs spent
the next three years studying the matter.

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:42.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures are clear on this point . . .

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, his findings met
with little interest by his fellow ministers.

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Ezekiel 18:4:

00:09:48.237 --> 00:09:52.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, by 1840,

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
his conscience troubled him so much

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:01.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the differences
between what the Bible teaches

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what he was being obliged to teach
as a Methodist Episcopal minister

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:08.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he resigned his position.

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:13.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1842, Storrs began publishing

00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:16.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
a monthly magazine entitled <i>Bible Examiner.</i>

00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:21.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before long, he met Henry Grew in person.

00:10:22.638 --> 00:10:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two became close friends

00:10:24.674 --> 00:10:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and collaborated in debates

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:29.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
against proponents
of the immortal soul doctrine.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:33.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and that scripture, Ezekiel 18:4,
that one I thought was . . .

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:38.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
George Storrs believed
that in order for everyone living

00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time of Christ’s return

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:43.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have an opportunity for salvation,

00:10:43.492 --> 00:10:46.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
a global preaching campaign was needed.

00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:51.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had no idea how such a thing
could be accomplished,

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in faith he wrote:

00:10:54.103 --> 00:10:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, too many,

00:10:56.272 --> 00:10:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they cannot see
just how a thing is to be done,

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:04.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
reject it as if it were impossible for God.

00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:14.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Storrs died in 1879
at his home in Brooklyn, New York,

00:11:15.624 --> 00:11:18.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the very neighborhood
that would become the focal point

00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:20.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the worldwide preaching work

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had so eagerly anticipated.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stage was now set

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
for light to emerge from darkness.

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:49.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was in 1845

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Joseph and Ann Eliza Russell

00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:56.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
emigrated from Ireland
to Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:04.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would have five children,
among them Charles Taze.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
But times were hard.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
His brother Thomas died at age five.

00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:14.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before Charles turned nine,

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
two more of his siblings died.

00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then his mother died.

00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK, Son.
Everything is going to be all right.

00:12:41.076 --> 00:12:44.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
That same year
—1861—

00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:47.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
the United States
became embroiled in a civil war

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would send 618,000 to their graves.

00:12:58.227 --> 00:13:00.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thousands perished on battlefields

00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:03.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
not far from where
the Russells lived and worked.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would be able to see firsthand

00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:22.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
the havoc that war wreaks on people

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:24.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the suffering, the death.

00:13:27.423 --> 00:13:31.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young Charles Russell thought often
about what happens to the dead.

00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most religions held
that God created man immortal

00:13:38.968 --> 00:13:43.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that He made a fiery hell
in which to torment people forever

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
—except for those predestined for salvation.

00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:54.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell’s feelings about such teachings
came through in what he wrote.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
A God that would use his power

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
to create human beings

00:14:00.122 --> 00:14:04.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom he foreknew and predestinated
should be eternally tormented

00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be neither wise, just,

00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:11.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor loving.

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:14.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
His standard would be lower
than that of many men.

00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:19.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could never reconcile

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:22.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
the teaching of eternal torment

00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:26.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the description in the Bible
of a loving God.

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:30.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he examined the creeds
of the great churches,

00:14:30.152 --> 00:14:34.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he saw that they taught
that the wicked are tormented eternally,

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:37.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
why, he just could not accept that!

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole culture,

00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:41.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
the religious culture at that time,

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:44.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a matter of believing
that God was a God of vengeance.

00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:47.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Russell knew that the Bible said,

00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:51.473 line:10% position:50% align:center
as it does at 1 John 4:8: “God is love.”

00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could a God of love do this?

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so his faith wavered.

00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:01.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt that he could do
the most good for people

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:03.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
through business and philanthropy.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a preteen,

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:10.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
he became his father’s partner
in a growing chain of clothing stores.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Charles Russell enlarged the business,

00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
eventually operating
a number of stores by himself.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s your change.
Thank you for coming.

00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:27.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
By age 25, he possessed
over three hundred thousand dollars,

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:31.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
the equivalent
of seven million dollars today.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, his search for truth continued.

00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:55.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1869, something happened
that would help reestablish his faith.

00:16:06.615 --> 00:16:09.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seemingly by accident one evening,

00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
I dropped into
a dusty, dingy hall

00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:14.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see if the handful who met there

00:16:14.823 --> 00:16:18.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
had anything more sensible to offer
than the creeds of the great churches.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:26.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us take note of the words
of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus himself,

00:16:26.935 --> 00:16:28.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the apostles in . . .

00:16:28.937 --> 00:16:31.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
There, for the first time,

00:16:31.173 --> 00:16:33.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard something of the views
of Second Adventists

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:36.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the preacher Mr. Jonas Wendell.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he said unto them, . . .”

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though his Scripture exposition
was not entirely clear,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was sufficient, under God,

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:46.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reestablish my wavering faith

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the divine inspiration of the Bible.

00:16:50.292 --> 00:16:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember at this point,
Russell is not an atheist

00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:55.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s just discouraged.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:58.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t feel
the truth can be found anywhere.

00:16:58.467 --> 00:17:02.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that sermon by a Second Adventist

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:06.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
was enough to get him to take
his well-worn Bible off the shelf

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:09.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to start digging again.

00:17:09.478 --> 00:17:13.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve already seen, the word “Trinity”
doesn’t appear anywhere in the Bible.

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fired with enthusiasm, Charles;

00:17:15.984 --> 00:17:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
his father, Joseph;

00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a few acquaintances
in Pittsburgh and Allegheny

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:23.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
formed a class for Bible study.

00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:25.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would take a subject.

00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:28.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would get a Bible concordance.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:33.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would look up every single scripture
that had a bearing on the subject.

00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:35.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they would write down
their conclusions.

00:17:35.838 --> 00:17:39.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they would say: ‘All right.
This is what the Bible teaches.

00:17:39.908 --> 00:17:42.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are going to believe this.’

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and God’s Word is clear.

00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:48.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
After five years of study,
the religious thinking of these men

00:17:48.283 --> 00:17:50.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
had undergone remarkable change.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ’s return
will mean great blessings . . . 

00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:55.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their study of the Bible
led them to major conclusions

00:17:55.724 --> 00:17:58.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
that challenged
the prevailing religious views of the day.

00:18:01.797 --> 00:18:06.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, while most religions
taught that man has a soul,

00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:09.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell and his associates concluded

00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
that man is a soul and that the soul can die.

00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, whereas
Christendom’s churches teach

00:18:18.247 --> 00:18:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost are one person,

00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:27.022 line:10% position:50% align:center
these students held that Jehovah is one God

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:29.024 line:10% position:50% align:center
and not part of a Trinity.

00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:32.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, while some churches

00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
were teaching
that Christ would return in the flesh

00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:38.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the earth would be destroyed,

00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:41.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
this small group came to understand

00:18:41.336 --> 00:18:43.505 line:10% position:50% align:center
that Christ would return invisibly

00:18:43.505 --> 00:18:45.274 line:10% position:50% align:center
—in the spirit—

00:18:45.274 --> 00:18:48.610 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the purpose
of blessing obedient mankind.

00:18:49.978 --> 00:18:52.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it wasn’t just philosophizing,

00:18:52.581 --> 00:18:55.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
just talking about
‘what if’ or ‘perhaps this way,’

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:59.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they were focused
on actually trying to find the truth.

00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, the fact that they decided
to write down those conclusions showed

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:06.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had a belief
that there is some truth to be found.

00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:11.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see light only
when it’s Jehovah’s time to reveal light.

00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:16.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so this was the beginning
of Jehovah’s time

00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead his people out of darkness
into the wonderful light.

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:31.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Charles Russell
never professed to be divinely inspired.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
He acknowledged the assistance
he had received

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jonas Wendell,

00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:39.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
from George Storrs,

00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:41.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from someone who also brought about

00:19:41.864 --> 00:19:44.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of his greatest tests of faith,

00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:47.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nelson Barbour,
publisher of the journal

00:19:47.703 --> 00:19:49.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Herald of the Morning.</i>

00:19:51.406 --> 00:19:55.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a business trip,
Russell received a copy of the <i>Herald.</i>

00:19:56.144 --> 00:19:58.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its contents were a surprise.

00:19:59.648 --> 00:20:03.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Russell, Barbour held
that Christ’s return would be invisible.

00:20:05.687 --> 00:20:08.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell arranged a meeting with Barbour.

00:20:09.925 --> 00:20:12.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, Russell’s Bible study group of about 30

00:20:12.594 --> 00:20:14.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
merged with Barbour’s larger group.

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell contributed funds
to print <i>Herald of the Morning.</i>

00:20:19.034 --> 00:20:21.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
The business is an excellent one!

00:20:21.036 --> 00:20:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
By this time,

00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:24.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell began
to sell out his business interests

00:20:24.406 --> 00:20:25.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to preach full-time.

00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:28.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and all that is needed from me

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to leave this business behind
and start a new life.

00:20:31.613 --> 00:20:32.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:20:32.781 --> 00:20:34.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:35.017 --> 00:20:37.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I wish you well in your new endeavors.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was convinced
that the presence of the Lord

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:50.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
is of utmost importance.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:55.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
The presence of Christ is not compared
to the Flood but to the days of Noah.

00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the age of 25,

00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:01.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
he went from city to city
to speak at various public gatherings,

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the streets,

00:21:05.047 --> 00:21:07.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to Protestant churches
and their clergy.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t want to form another church.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:12.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were already enough denominations,
in his mind.

00:21:12.888 --> 00:21:14.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
There he presented

00:21:14.256 --> 00:21:16.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
these main Bible teachings to them

00:21:16.825 --> 00:21:19.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and urged them to study the matter

00:21:19.394 --> 00:21:22.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then to use their pulpits
to preach that message.

00:21:22.664 --> 00:21:25.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, they laughed
and made fun of him and went their way.

00:21:25.767 --> 00:21:27.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then that’s why Russell decided,

00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:30.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, somebody has to preach these things.’

00:21:30.172 --> 00:21:32.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he would use
his time and energies to do it.

00:21:32.908 --> 00:21:36.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
You would assume that being well-off,

00:21:36.178 --> 00:21:38.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could have supported someone else.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have taken the easy way out

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:43.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps have funded
someone else to do the work.

00:21:43.819 --> 00:21:46.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed his whole life
to center around it.

00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:48.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
By selling his business

00:21:48.757 --> 00:21:50.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and getting involved personally with it,

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:53.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can see the passion,
the love, that he had for the truth.

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:00.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s your mail, Mr. Russell.

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:02.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:06.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
After two years of association
with Nelson Barbour,

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:09.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
a dispute arose that would test the loyalty

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
of each member of the Bible study group.

00:22:13.048 --> 00:22:15.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Barbour had written an article for the <i>Herald</i>

00:22:15.617 --> 00:22:18.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
spurning the teaching
that Christ’s death could provide

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
a ransom for sinners.

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though professing to believe in the ransom,

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:28.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Barbour wrote that the notion
that Christ’s death paid for mankind’s sins

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
was “unscriptural,
and obnoxious to all our ideas of justice.”

00:22:33.869 --> 00:22:37.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell, his young coeditor, disagreed.

00:22:37.806 --> 00:22:39.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the pages of the <i>Herald,</i>

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:43.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell went to great lengths
to defend this Bible truth.

00:22:44.012 --> 00:22:46.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unpleasant though it be,

00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:48.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel it necessary to take exception

00:22:48.283 --> 00:22:50.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
to an article by my brother
on this subject.

00:22:51.486 --> 00:22:52.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
I make the objection,

00:22:52.988 --> 00:22:55.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
not from a spirit of controversy,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because I believe the doctrine
assailed in that article

00:22:58.493 --> 00:23:01.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be one of the most important teachings
of God’s Word.

00:23:03.365 --> 00:23:08.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus Christ by the grace of God
tasted death for every man.

00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:13.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the <i>Herald,</i> Barbour fired back.

00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:16.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tell you such a theology is <i>false,</i>

00:23:16.344 --> 00:23:21.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such justice an abhorrence
to the principle of right and wrong.

00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:27.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dismayed by Barbour’s refusal
to accept this Scriptural teaching,

00:23:27.889 --> 00:23:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell asked him privately either to resign

00:23:30.926 --> 00:23:33.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to sell his share of the paper.

00:23:34.429 --> 00:23:37.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I still feel
that you are a brother in Christ,

00:23:37.566 --> 00:23:40.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
the points of variance seem to me
to be so fundamental

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
and important

00:23:42.871 --> 00:23:46.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
that full fellowship
no longer obtains between you and me.

00:23:47.642 --> 00:23:50.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that our relationship should cease.

00:23:53.281 --> 00:23:55.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
After months of controversy,

00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:58.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell’s group withdrew from Barbour’s.

00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:07.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, Russell
severed all ties with <i>Herald of the Morning.</i>

00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Russell

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
realized that he could not restore
this man’s wavering faith,

00:24:15.437 --> 00:24:18.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
in fact, lack of faith.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he took it as the Lord’s will

00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:23.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he begin to publish another magazine, 

00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:27.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>
<i>and Herald of Christ’s Presence</i>

00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:32.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>—</i>first issue, July 1879.

00:24:34.356 --> 00:24:38.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same year that Thomas Edison
patented the electric light,

00:24:40.428 --> 00:24:44.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Charles Russell had gone
from student to publisher.

00:24:46.268 --> 00:24:48.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus dawned a new era

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
of both literal and spiritual light.

00:25:07.122 --> 00:25:09.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
From its first installment,

00:25:09.124 --> 00:25:13.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>
championed firm belief in the ransom.

00:25:14.496 --> 00:25:17.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many who had associated with Nelson Barbour

00:25:17.032 --> 00:25:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
sided with Russell on this issue.

00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:23.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1879 and 1880,

00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:26.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell and the readers of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>

00:25:26.374 --> 00:25:28.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
formed 30 congregations.

00:25:30.812 --> 00:25:32.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who joined them

00:25:32.847 --> 00:25:36.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
became known simply
as the Bible Students.

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:39.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
People who love the truth

00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:42.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
want to have answers,
answers to questions:

00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:45.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is God? Why are we here?
Where are we going?

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re disillusioned
by what they see in the churches.

00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:50.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so they’re searching,
and so they found something.

00:25:52.934 --> 00:25:56.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, Russell and other dedicated Christians

00:25:56.838 --> 00:25:59.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
established a nonprofit Bible society

00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:02.177 line:10% position:50% align:center
to enable them to give wider distribution

00:26:02.177 --> 00:26:04.846 line:10% position:50% align:center
to Bible literature in various languages.

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:10.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the very beginning,
it was agreed

00:26:10.018 --> 00:26:13.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there would never be
any begging or petitioning for money.

00:26:14.689 --> 00:26:19.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work would always be advanced
through voluntary donations.

00:26:21.796 --> 00:26:25.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the annual commemoration
of Christ’s death

00:26:25.066 --> 00:26:28.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
came opportunities to hold large conventions.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:33.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, these were held regularly.

00:26:37.178 --> 00:26:39.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian baptism was customary.

00:26:44.452 --> 00:26:48.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students sought to adhere
to the Scriptural command

00:26:48.089 --> 00:26:51.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘not forsake the assembling
of themselves together.’

00:27:03.471 --> 00:27:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another arrangement
that intended to encourage

00:27:05.607 --> 00:27:08.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
the small but growing
number of Bible Students

00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:10.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
came in 1894.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling representatives, called pilgrims,

00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:18.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
were dispatched to conduct meetings

00:27:18.353 --> 00:27:22.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to assist these fledgling congregations.

00:27:27.862 --> 00:27:29.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
About that time,

00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:31.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell began to publish books

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
containing the results
of his Biblical research,

00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:37.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
eventually writing six volumes.

00:27:38.773 --> 00:27:40.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
These books came to be known as

00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:43.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Studies in the Scriptures.</i>

00:27:45.647 --> 00:27:47.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
As people read these books,

00:27:47.949 --> 00:27:51.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were moved
to share with others what they learned.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, people
who were honesthearted

00:27:58.326 --> 00:28:01.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
could hear the ring of truth.

00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:03.465 line:10% position:50% align:center
They just saw that this is the truth.

00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:04.799 line:10% position:50% align:center
And it was quite different

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.935 line:10% position:50% align:center
from what other Christian denominations

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:08.103 line:10% position:50% align:center
were teaching.

00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
The impact of these volumes on the people

00:28:12.374 --> 00:28:14.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that some

00:28:14.376 --> 00:28:17.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
immediately changed things in their lives.

00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:22.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students were putting into practice

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they were learning from the Scriptures.

00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:57.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1881,

00:28:57.218 --> 00:28:59.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
the article “Wanted 1,000 Preachers”

00:28:59.754 --> 00:29:02.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
invited readers of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
to distribute Bible literature publically.

00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:10.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some full-time preachers
—called colporteurs—

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:13.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
preached from house to house,
bringing the message

00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:16.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
directly to people’s homes.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
The July 1881 <i>Watch Tower</i>

00:29:21.209 --> 00:29:23.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminded readers that all true Christians

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a responsibility to preach.

00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:31.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew this was the truth,
and they were telling people about it.

00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:33.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as every individual Witness today

00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:35.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
knows he has the truth
and he has to tell the people around him

00:29:35.957 --> 00:29:37.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s what it amounts to.

00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:42.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1899, <i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>

00:29:42.297 --> 00:29:44.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
proposed a new method of preaching

00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:48.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
—handing publications to people
after they left church on Sunday.

00:29:49.938 --> 00:29:54.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one stage, Russell
endeavored to talk to the religious leaders.

00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:56.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could see then that there wasn’t a chance

00:29:56.911 --> 00:30:00.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help modify those church systems,

00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:02.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
but rather it was more important

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
to approach people on an individual basis

00:30:05.286 --> 00:30:07.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give them the opportunity.

00:30:07.288 --> 00:30:08.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can imagine the reaction,

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
the feelings of those who would come out.

00:30:11.025 --> 00:30:14.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had gone
to an established church or religion;

00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:16.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had seen a man who, 

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:19.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their view, perhaps has been educated
and knows what he’s talking about.

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:21.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
They go outside,

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:23.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here are humble people

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to tell them something
from the Scriptures.

00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:28.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think our work
was ever intended to be confrontational,

00:30:28.142 --> 00:30:30.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was to draw attention to the message.

00:30:30.178 --> 00:30:34.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Confrontation came because we were there,
because we were doing the work.

00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:38.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the idea was to draw attention
to what the message from the Bible is.

00:30:39.454 --> 00:30:43.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
These booklets and tracts exposed
the church’s departure

00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:45.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Bible teachings.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they infuriated Christendom’s clergy.

00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:51.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now this affected

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:54.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
the money that was coming
into many churches.

00:30:54.302 --> 00:30:58.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because once people saw the truth
and saw that they had been taught falsehood,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was only logical that they would withdraw

00:31:01.576 --> 00:31:03.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would not give their support

00:31:03.578 --> 00:31:06.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
to religious institutions
that were teaching falsehood.

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:12.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1903, Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Hall

00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:14.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the scene of a six-day debate.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
E. L. Eaton,
pastor of a Methodist-Episcopal church

00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:24.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and representing an alliance
of Protestant clergymen, had one aim

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:27.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to destroy Russell’s influence,

00:31:27.368 --> 00:31:31.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly with regard to his teachings
about the condition of the dead.

00:31:32.774 --> 00:31:35.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really wanted to expose Russell

00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:37.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a man who was ignorant of the Bible

00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a fraud who wasn’t qualified

00:31:39.847 --> 00:31:43.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get on a platform and preach
about Bible subjects.

00:31:44.352 --> 00:31:46.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell really did a very good job

00:31:46.354 --> 00:31:48.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
of presenting his arguments

00:31:48.356 --> 00:31:50.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and establishing Bible truths,

00:31:50.458 --> 00:31:52.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing he was very qualified

00:31:52.126 --> 00:31:54.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal with Scripture.

00:31:55.897 --> 00:31:57.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
People had a chance

00:31:57.932 --> 00:32:01.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to see the contrast between the two

00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:04.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had a chance to see that Bible truths

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:07.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
were clear on many of those points.

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:11.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was reported that one clergyman
who had been there to support Eaton

00:32:11.546 --> 00:32:13.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
came up to Russell afterward and said:

00:32:13.982 --> 00:32:17.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am glad to see you turn the hose on hell
and put out the fire.”

00:32:17.852 --> 00:32:20.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local newspaper published

00:32:20.388 --> 00:32:22.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
a full account
of each debate the following day.

00:32:25.093 --> 00:32:27.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the brothers got the idea,

00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:31.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not have Brother Russell
have a sermon printed each week

00:32:31.065 --> 00:32:33.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the newspapers simultaneously?

00:32:33.968 --> 00:32:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
They, in turn,
would telegraph the sermons out

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all the newspapers in the United States,

00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:40.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Canada, and even parts of Europe.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:46.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell’s sermons
could be found in 2,000 newspapers,

00:32:46.414 --> 00:32:49.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
reaching 15 million readers.

00:32:53.588 --> 00:32:56.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
The message was spreading quickly,

00:32:56.524 --> 00:32:58.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the Bible Students were determined

00:32:58.826 --> 00:33:01.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it should penetrate
to all corners of the earth.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:07.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
To that end, Russell prepared
an even more intensive campaign.

00:33:10.304 --> 00:33:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up to 1908,

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work had been directed
from Russell’s hometown,

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
now a part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:33:20.615 --> 00:33:24.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to accomplish
a more extensive, international work,

00:33:24.686 --> 00:33:29.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
the headquarters,
known as the Bible House, was far too small.

00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:32.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1908,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell dispatched
J. F. Rutherford and others to New York City

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
to secure more suitable quarters.

00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:44.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
The place was named Bethel,
meaning “House of God.”

00:33:46.607 --> 00:33:49.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who lived there
were called the Bethel family,

00:33:50.745 --> 00:33:53.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
each a volunteer,

00:33:53.815 --> 00:33:57.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
each working vigorously
to shine the Bible’s light

00:33:57.385 --> 00:33:59.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
into all the earth.

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:04.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
As far back as 1891,

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:07.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell and some associates
had been traveling to other lands

00:34:07.562 --> 00:34:09.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help people spiritually.

00:34:09.564 --> 00:34:11.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, I would like
to take our preaching worldwide.

00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:16.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
One 17,000-mile journey

00:34:16.738 --> 00:34:21.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
took them to Europe, Asia, and Africa.

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:27.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the results of that trip was this:

00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:30.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a need seen for publications

00:34:30.852 --> 00:34:32.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
in various languages.

00:34:32.854 --> 00:34:35.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not long after he would visit a place,

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:38.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could see these groups of Bible Students
start to spring up.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work was starting to go international.

00:34:42.263 --> 00:34:46.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during the years 1909 through 1912,

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell intensified his efforts,

00:34:48.703 --> 00:34:51.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveling across Europe,

00:34:54.108 --> 00:34:55.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Middle East,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually around the world.

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
His travels enabled him

00:35:11.392 --> 00:35:13.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
to observe millions of people

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:19.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see firsthand
what it would really mean

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let the light of truth
shine into all the earth.

00:35:41.489 --> 00:35:46.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1914, there were 5,000 Bible Students

00:35:46.027 --> 00:35:48.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching in 68 lands.

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:54.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world’s population
was approaching two billion.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was there a way
to reach more people in less time?

00:36:01.776 --> 00:36:05.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
New technologies had opened up a possibility.

00:36:10.218 --> 00:36:12.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “Photo-Drama of Creation”

00:36:12.887 --> 00:36:17.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
is presented by the IBSA,

00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
the International Bible Students Association.

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:26.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its aim is public instruction
along religio-scientific lines

00:36:26.834 --> 00:36:31.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in defense of the Bible
as the inspired Word of God.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students did something
that had never been done before.

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:40.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
By synchronizing slides and film footage

00:36:40.882 --> 00:36:44.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
with music and dialogue, they produced

00:36:44.518 --> 00:36:47.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
an eight-hour audiovisual presentation.

00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:52.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
The idea was
to show the development of God’s purpose

00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:54.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the beginning of creation

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Millennial Reign of Christ.

00:37:00.868 --> 00:37:03.204 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was shown in two-hour segments

00:37:03.204 --> 00:37:05.239 line:10% position:50% align:center
over four nights.

00:37:08.075 --> 00:37:11.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first part
dealt with each of the creative days,

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:21.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Flood of Noah’s day,

00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:32.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the faith of Abraham.

00:37:37.104 --> 00:37:40.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part 2 showed scenes
of God’s dealings with ancient Israel,

00:37:44.545 --> 00:37:46.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Exodus

00:37:50.084 --> 00:37:52.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the reign of the Judean kings.

00:37:56.958 --> 00:38:00.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third segment dealt
with the destruction of Solomon’s temple

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Messianic prophecies
and their fulfillment.

00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:26.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Part 4, viewers saw the story
of the spread of Christianity,

00:38:29.223 --> 00:38:31.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
the persecution that resulted,

00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:37.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the huge populations

00:38:37.131 --> 00:38:40.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet to be reached with the Kingdom message.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Showings were organized
so that 80 cities could be served each day.

00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:56.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students themselves
paid all expenses needed

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rent suitable theaters.

00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:06.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “Photo-Drama of Creation”
was a technical feat previously unmatched.

00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:16.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be another decade
before a full-length commercial film

00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:18.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
would combine music,

00:39:20.508 --> 00:39:22.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
synchronized dialogue,

00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:26.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and color footage.

00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:33.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just one year,

00:39:33.254 --> 00:39:35.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
nine million people around the earth

00:39:35.923 --> 00:39:39.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
had seen the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:47.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many who saw it

00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:51.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
were convinced that they had discovered
the path of increasing light.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1876, Russell had written an article

00:40:16.163 --> 00:40:17.832 line:10% position:50% align:center
in <i>Bible Examiner</i>

00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:21.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
entitled “Gentile Times: When Do They End?”

00:40:21.469 --> 00:40:23.471 line:10% position:50% align:center
in which he stated

00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:26.540 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the “seven times” will end in 1914.

00:40:29.743 --> 00:40:31.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
Russell concluded

00:40:31.412 --> 00:40:33.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the basis of the tree dream

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 4

00:40:35.983 --> 00:40:39.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the dynasty that began with King David

00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:44.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be restored
2,520 years after its overthrow.

00:40:48.162 --> 00:40:50.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
During those years,

00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:52.399 line:10% position:50% align:center
no Davidic king would rule.

00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:56.303 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students referred to that period

00:40:56.303 --> 00:40:58.739 line:10% position:50% align:center
as “the Gentile Times.”

00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:03.144 line:10% position:50% align:center
What would happen at the end of those years?

00:41:05.479 --> 00:41:07.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reasoned that since Jesus

00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:11.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the only one qualified
to assume the throne of David,

00:41:11.285 --> 00:41:15.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Christ himself
would begin ruling in 1914.

00:41:18.492 --> 00:41:20.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would that mean for the earth?

00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:27.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reasoning on Daniel chapter 2
and Matthew chapter 24,

00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:31.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students preached
that a time of global anarchy would come,

00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:34.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
which would culminate
in the end of the system of things.

00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:37.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
They believed that about that time,

00:41:37.511 --> 00:41:40.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation would be taken to heaven.

00:41:41.148 --> 00:41:44.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
They realized that 1914 had a significance,

00:41:44.652 --> 00:41:47.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it meant the end of the Gentile Times.

00:41:47.688 --> 00:41:51.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at that time, they felt
that perhaps the work would be finished

00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:54.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they would go home, as it were.

00:41:54.562 --> 00:41:57.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they were looking forward
to a time of reward.

00:41:57.331 --> 00:42:00.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did understand
that there was a significance to the year.

00:42:00.901 --> 00:42:05.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Primarily, they thought that 1914
would just be the start

00:42:05.339 --> 00:42:09.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the judgment
coming upon the world, or Armageddon.

00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:16.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, people in general
were anticipating a different sort of future.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:23.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many who wrote memoirs
about the summer of 1914

00:42:23.857 --> 00:42:27.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
described it
as one of “exceptional tranquility,” 

00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:29.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“full of hope and promise.”

00:42:32.066 --> 00:42:34.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some analysts felt that in 1914,

00:42:34.835 --> 00:42:38.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
conditions were better than ever
for achieving world peace.

00:42:41.609 --> 00:42:45.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
What the Bible Students had been preaching
about global anarchy

00:42:45.112 --> 00:42:47.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
seemed highly unlikely.

00:42:48.382 --> 00:42:50.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Bible Students

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:54.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
counted the days and continued working.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, on June 28, 1914,

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Austria-Hungary’s crown prince
and his wife were murdered.

00:43:07.468 --> 00:43:09.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
His assassin fired the shots

00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:13.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
that began the bloodiest war
mankind had yet experienced.

00:43:28.656 --> 00:43:31.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notions of tranquility were shattered

00:43:31.158 --> 00:43:35.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
as nation after nation became enmeshed

00:43:35.396 --> 00:43:37.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
in “the Great War.”

00:43:49.176 --> 00:43:51.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
These and other historical events

00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:54.748 line:10% position:50% align:center
matched what Jesus said would characterize

00:43:54.748 --> 00:43:57.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
“the conclusion of the system of things.”

00:44:03.757 --> 00:44:06.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
When World War I broke out in July,

00:44:06.093 --> 00:44:07.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
they felt vindicated.

00:44:07.761 --> 00:44:09.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthened their faith in the Bible,

00:44:09.763 --> 00:44:11.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s prophetic Word,

00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:15.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also, it enhanced their trust
that Jehovah was using

00:44:15.502 --> 00:44:19.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Russell and his friends
to explain truth to others.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:34.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Brooklyn Bethel on October 2, 1914,

00:44:34.655 --> 00:44:37.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Charles Russell
made a monumental announcement.

00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:40.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Gentile Times have ended;

00:44:40.627 --> 00:44:43.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
their kings have had their day!

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:51.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Expectations were still running high.

00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:55.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of the Bible Students were hoping
for an immediate heavenly reward.

00:44:56.977 --> 00:44:59.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I just might say that my mother,

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was ready to sell up
everything in the home

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.718 line:10% position:50% align:center
because she thought

00:45:04.718 --> 00:45:06.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the end was coming in 1914,

00:45:06.387 --> 00:45:08.622 line:10% position:50% align:center
and her feelings were that

00:45:08.622 --> 00:45:11.024 line:10% position:50% align:center
of a lot of the brothers back there.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite such expectations,

00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:20.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
the distressing world conditions
that erupted in 1914

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not mean
that the Bible Students’ job was done.

00:45:26.707 --> 00:45:30.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell felt sure that a great work remained.

00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:32.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote:

00:45:34.014 --> 00:45:37.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should lose no time
dreaming that the door is shut!

00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:40.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are people who are seeking the Truth

00:45:42.089 --> 00:45:44.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
—people who are sitting in darkness.

00:45:47.528 --> 00:45:51.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
—<i>The Watch Tower, </i> February 15, 1915.

00:45:54.101 --> 00:45:57.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Russell
would not personally reach those people.

00:46:01.208 --> 00:46:05.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1916, in the course of a preaching tour,

00:46:05.446 --> 00:46:08.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
he died at the age of 64.

00:46:13.287 --> 00:46:17.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had spent his entire fortune
preaching the Bible’s message.

00:46:25.466 --> 00:46:28.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whereas the majority of the Bible Students

00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:31.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
kept studying the Bible
and sharing its message,

00:46:32.606 --> 00:46:36.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
others simply could not overcome
their disappointments

00:46:40.781 --> 00:46:43.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
—disappointment that 1914

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:46.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not fulfill all their expectations

00:46:47.788 --> 00:46:51.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
compounded by natural grief
over Russell’s death.

00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:58.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it was a big shock

00:46:58.098 --> 00:47:00.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they were used to
his taking the lead,

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:02.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they figured
he was going to take the lead

00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:05.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the Lord came
and took them all to heaven.

00:47:05.038 --> 00:47:08.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they just
didn’t know what to do for a while.

00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:13.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were totally shocked
as to how to carry on.

00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:19.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some would sever all association
with the Bible Students

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attempt to draw others after them.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would happen to the Bible Students?

00:47:27.594 --> 00:47:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would they disperse
as if followers of Russell?

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:36.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not a work of man.

00:47:36.537 --> 00:47:39.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a work of Jehovah God.

00:47:39.473 --> 00:47:44.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s evident that Jehovah
had already chosen this organization

00:47:44.478 --> 00:47:49.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the faithfulness and the sincerity
of the men who were behind it.

00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:52.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was obvious that Jehovah
had already chosen this organization

00:47:52.219 --> 00:47:54.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get his work done.

00:47:54.054 --> 00:47:56.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were enough honesthearted men

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
hungering for the truth,

00:47:58.592 --> 00:48:00.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
desirous of doing the will of God,

00:48:00.627 --> 00:48:04.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent the organization from collapsing.

00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:08.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than giving in to disappointment

00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:12.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
over what did not happen in 1914,

00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:14.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students kept their minds open

00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:17.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the significance of what had taken place.

00:48:22.115 --> 00:48:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world war and its aftermath

00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:26.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
had become the world-shaking events

00:48:26.587 --> 00:48:30.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
proclaimed by Russell
almost 40 years earlier.

00:48:32.859 --> 00:48:35.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students
were coming to the realization

00:48:35.062 --> 00:48:38.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Christ’s presence had begun in 1914,

00:48:39.232 --> 00:48:42.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the world’s last days were underway!

00:48:45.238 --> 00:48:48.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two months after Russell’s death,

00:48:48.108 --> 00:48:51.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph Rutherford
was appointed to oversee the work.

00:48:54.948 --> 00:48:57.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford had been
a close associate of Russell,

00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveling with him

00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:01.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speaking in his defense.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:08.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Russell, he believed
that the good news had to be preached.

00:49:08.462 --> 00:49:10.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was dynamic

00:49:11.698 --> 00:49:13.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and could not be intimidated.

00:49:15.702 --> 00:49:18.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, not everyone appreciated these traits

00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:21.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even among the Bible Students.

00:49:21.608 --> 00:49:23.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford,

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was an entirely different personality,

00:49:26.913 --> 00:49:29.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
brusque in manner,

00:49:29.082 --> 00:49:33.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he didn’t fear to tread on anyone’s toes.

00:49:34.187 --> 00:49:38.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think this was a tremendous test
on the brothers

00:49:38.425 --> 00:49:42.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they really
had been worshipping the creature

00:49:42.496 --> 00:49:44.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than the Creator.

00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:48.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford directed that Russell’s notes

00:49:48.435 --> 00:49:51.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a seventh volume
of <i>Studies in the Scriptures</i>

00:49:51.271 --> 00:49:55.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
be compiled into a new book
called <i>The Finished Mystery.</i>

00:49:58.478 --> 00:50:00.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the day that the book was completed

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had a supply in his office,

00:50:02.716 --> 00:50:05.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
he arranged for brothers to put one

00:50:05.018 --> 00:50:07.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
at each place
at the tables in the dining room.

00:50:09.356 --> 00:50:11.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, when the family came down to eat,

00:50:11.391 --> 00:50:13.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
each one had a copy

00:50:13.226 --> 00:50:15.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the book <i>The Finished Mystery.</i>

00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:18.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were quite curious about it
and wondered what it was all about

00:50:18.398 --> 00:50:20.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enthused about it.

00:50:20.567 --> 00:50:23.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there was already
a growing tension in the family

00:50:23.704 --> 00:50:25.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
because some of the responsible brothers

00:50:25.706 --> 00:50:27.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
sort of resented Brother Rutherford.

00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:30.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them had ambitions for themselves.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they used the occasion to bring
accusations against Brother Rutherford

00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:37.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
for having gone ahead and published this
without their permission and their knowledge.

00:50:38.485 --> 00:50:39.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the result was, eventually,

00:50:39.986 --> 00:50:42.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a five-hour tirade
against Brother Rutherford,

00:50:42.556 --> 00:50:46.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
where a number brought
a lot of unjust accusations against him.

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:51.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Macmillan tells that, well, that day,

00:50:51.665 --> 00:50:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
they left the dining room
and most of the food was uneaten

00:50:54.468 --> 00:50:56.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the family was very sad.

00:50:57.037 --> 00:50:59.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the community at large,

00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:01.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
people were taking note
of <i>The Finished Mystery.</i>

00:51:03.076 --> 00:51:06.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
They originally planned on a distribution

00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:07.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
of about less than a hundred thousand.

00:51:07.814 --> 00:51:09.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, within a short time,

00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:13.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 850,000 copies had to be printed.

00:51:15.989 --> 00:51:18.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
The clergy hated the book!

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:22.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
It exposed
their unscriptural teachings and practices.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it publicly condemned them

00:51:26.133 --> 00:51:28.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
for their involvement in the world war.

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:31.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
The clergy fought back!

00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:38.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using the heightened patriotism of wartime
to their advantage,

00:51:38.812 --> 00:51:41.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
they falsely accused the Bible Students

00:51:41.448 --> 00:51:43.950 line:10% position:50% align:center
of sedition,

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.753 line:10% position:50% align:center
espionage,

00:51:46.753 --> 00:51:49.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
and treason,

00:51:49.623 --> 00:51:51.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
and they urged the U.S. government

00:51:51.625 --> 00:51:53.326 line:10% position:50% align:center
to halt their work. 

00:51:57.197 --> 00:52:00.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
On May 8, 1918,

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph Rutherford and seven of his associates
were arrested.

00:52:16.983 --> 00:52:21.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
On June 20, they were convicted
on four counts of sedition.

00:52:26.893 --> 00:52:29.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
July 4, 1918,

00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:32.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford and his associates
were transported

00:52:32.098 --> 00:52:34.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the federal penitentiary
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:52:34.601 --> 00:52:36.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sentence?

00:52:36.603 --> 00:52:38.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty years in prison:

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
George Fisher,

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:46.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hugh Macmillan,

00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:50.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Robert Martin,

00:52:50.884 --> 00:52:53.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frederick Robison,

00:52:54.287 --> 00:52:57.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph Rutherford,

00:52:58.658 --> 00:53:02.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
William Van Amburgh,

00:53:02.729 --> 00:53:05.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clayton Woodworth.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sentenced to ten years in prison:

00:53:10.637 --> 00:53:12.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Giovanni DeCecca<b>.</b>

00:53:18.578 --> 00:53:22.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was quite a shock to them
to be put in prison.

00:53:22.749 --> 00:53:24.751 line:10% position:50% align:center
Did they do something

00:53:24.751 --> 00:53:26.419 line:10% position:50% align:center
that they shouldn’t have done?

00:53:26.419 --> 00:53:28.555 line:10% position:50% align:center
Was the Lord displeased with them?

00:53:28.555 --> 00:53:30.557 line:10% position:50% align:center
Or was the Lord permitting it?

00:53:30.557 --> 00:53:32.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just didn’t know.

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:36.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil stirs up people
to oppose us either directly or indirectly.

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the charge of sedition is one

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:43.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has often been used
against Jehovah’s people.

00:53:43.203 --> 00:53:45.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is just another ploy.

00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:48.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those brothers
certainly were not going around

00:53:48.275 --> 00:53:51.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to undermine the U.S. government.

00:53:52.279 --> 00:53:55.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
On August 26, 1918,

00:53:55.982 --> 00:53:58.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brooklyn headquarters was shut down.

00:53:59.853 --> 00:54:02.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Operations were moved back to Pittsburgh.

00:54:05.025 --> 00:54:07.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the minds of the clergy,

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:11.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
the voice of the Bible Students
had been silenced.

00:54:29.916 --> 00:54:34.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
On November 11, 1918, the world war ended.

00:54:46.433 --> 00:54:49.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prisoners of war were being released;

00:54:51.504 --> 00:54:54.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford and his associates were not.

00:54:56.076 --> 00:54:59.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appeared
that their opponents had succeeded.

00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:06.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students circulated a petition
for the release of the eight men

00:55:07.754 --> 00:55:11.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obtained 700,000 signatures!

00:55:13.126 --> 00:55:15.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 12, 1919,

00:55:15.295 --> 00:55:18.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Woodrow Wilson,
president of the United States,

00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:21.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
conceded that the prison terms
were excessive.

00:55:24.104 --> 00:55:28.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 26, all eight men were released.

00:55:28.341 --> 00:55:30.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
The charges were later dropped.

00:55:30.944 --> 00:55:33.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Lord was preparing them for the future.

00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:36.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was going to be a battle

00:55:36.449 --> 00:55:39.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the political, religious,
and commercial world,

00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:42.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Brother Rutherford

00:55:42.188 --> 00:55:45.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
was geared up and trained for that
after he got out.

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon their release,
the men were consumed with zeal.

00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:55.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within six months,
headquarters was moved back to Brooklyn

00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:59.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and arrangements were made
for a convention at Cedar Point, Ohio.

00:56:01.841 --> 00:56:05.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was here that they launched
a companion magazine to <i>The Watch Tower</i>

00:56:05.879 --> 00:56:08.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
called <i>The Golden</i> <i>Age.</i>

00:56:08.548 --> 00:56:10.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its purpose?

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
To explain the meaning of world events

00:56:13.586 --> 00:56:16.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to inspire hope in the supreme remedy.

00:56:17.724 --> 00:56:22.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford and his associates
had only just been released from prison.

00:56:22.395 --> 00:56:25.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then within a couple of months,

00:56:25.365 --> 00:56:28.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
they organized this tremendous convention,

00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:31.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then announced the release
of a new magazine—<i>The Golden Age.</i>

00:56:31.971 --> 00:56:36.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s something
that really is unbelievable.

00:56:36.009 --> 00:56:40.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
You go from one situation
where there is hardly anything happening.

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:43.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next thing, it’s just full speed ahead.

00:56:44.217 --> 00:56:47.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 8, 1922,

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
another convention was held at Cedar Point.

00:56:51.157 --> 00:56:53.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, Rutherford gave what would become

00:56:53.927 --> 00:56:56.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps his most memorable speech.

00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:02.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you believe that the King of glory
has begun his reign?

00:57:02.902 --> 00:57:05.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:57:05.238 --> 00:57:07.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then back to the field!

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:09.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world must know

00:57:09.709 --> 00:57:11.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is God

00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:13.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Jesus Christ

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:17.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
is King of kings
and Lord of lords.

00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:20.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the day of all days.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Behold, the King reigns!

00:57:24.924 --> 00:57:28.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are his publicity agents.

00:57:30.196 --> 00:57:33.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore advertise,

00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:35.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertise,

00:57:35.068 --> 00:57:39.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertise, the King and his kingdom.

00:57:55.321 --> 00:57:57.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And “advertise” they did<b>.</b>

00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:03.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it must have been daunting

00:58:03.796 --> 00:58:05.832 line:10% position:50% align:center
for them to contemplate the world

00:58:05.832 --> 00:58:07.500 line:10% position:50% align:center
as their territory

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a few thousand harvest workers.

00:58:10.837 --> 00:58:14.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew Jehovah would help them;
they knew others would join them.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they knew the work would expand.

00:58:16.376 --> 00:58:19.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could imagine someone
sitting there and saying,

00:58:19.345 --> 00:58:22.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How on earth would you ever get this done?’

00:58:22.315 --> 00:58:25.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that would seem to be
quite a sensible question.

00:58:25.818 --> 00:58:28.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those brothers
weren’t concerned with that.

00:58:28.488 --> 00:58:30.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had full faith in Jehovah.

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.425 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, our focus at the time

00:58:32.425 --> 00:58:35.028 line:10% position:50% align:center
in view of Brother Rutherford’s talk

00:58:35.028 --> 00:58:38.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
was that we’ve got something to do

00:58:38.631 --> 00:58:42.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve got to finish a work
that we’ve been entrusted with.

00:58:42.735 --> 00:58:46.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our focus was to get on with the job

00:58:46.339 --> 00:58:50.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fulfill our commission
as his servants here on the earth.

00:58:50.243 --> 00:58:53.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like some who had gone before them,

00:58:53.479 --> 00:58:55.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
these students of the Bible

00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:59.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the courage
to walk away from false beliefs.

00:59:02.655 --> 00:59:06.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they were different
in that they stuck together.

00:59:07.927 --> 00:59:10.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they refused to stop preaching,

00:59:12.265 --> 00:59:15.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the face of serious opposition.

00:59:18.037 --> 00:59:20.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of their endurance,

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:25.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
they continued to know the profound joy
of having emerged from darkness.

00:59:29.582 --> 00:59:33.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now a huge work lay ahead of them.

00:59:35.755 --> 00:59:39.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their future would be one
of increasing sacrifice

00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:44.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and great accomplishment.

00:59:49.435 --> 00:59:53.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
But their faith that Christ had begun ruling,

00:59:54.407 --> 00:59:58.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
coupled with their appreciation
for Jehovah’s direction and backing

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave them the courage they would need

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:06.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let the light of truth shine

01:00:06.886 --> 01:00:09.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
into all the earth.
