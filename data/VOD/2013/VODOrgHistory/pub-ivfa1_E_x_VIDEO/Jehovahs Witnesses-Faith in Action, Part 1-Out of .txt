00:00:04 For more than 100 years,
00:00:06 Jehovah’s Witnesses have proclaimed the Bible’s message
00:00:10 that God’s Kingdom
00:00:12 will rid the world of wickedness,
00:00:14 restore the earth to Paradise,
00:00:16 and raise mankind to perfection.
00:00:20 Sharing this truth, however,
00:00:22 has often resulted in persecution
00:00:25 from powerful institutions.
00:00:28 But why has such a positive message
00:00:30 elicited such a negative reaction?
00:00:34 And how have we overcome that opposition
00:00:37 to get to where we are today?
00:00:39 This is the story of a people
00:00:41 intent on living in the light of Bible truth,
00:00:45 no matter what hostility they may face.
00:00:48 As you watch, note the determination
00:00:51 of Jehovah’s modern-day servants
00:00:53 to study diligently, preach zealously,
00:00:56 and keep serving God faithfully.
00:00:59 This video is more than just history.
00:01:02 This is your story.
00:01:05 It’s a reminder that Jehovah God
00:01:07 is in full control
00:01:09 and that this is his organization.
00:01:13 It is a story that begins
00:01:15 over 6,000 years ago
00:01:18 —the story of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:33 In the Bible, light is associated with truth,
00:01:37 whereas darkness is associated with falsehood.
00:01:48 When God completed his creative works,
00:01:51 there was no spiritual darkness.
00:01:55 But after Adam and Eve sinned,
00:01:58 human society came under the control of Satan.
00:02:04 Shunning the light
00:02:06 would become the foremost goal of wicked people.
00:02:11 Anyone seeking truth in such a world would be opposed.
00:02:20 The light of truth shone brightly
00:02:23 when Jesus Christ walked the earth.
00:02:28 All who truly followed Jesus reflected the light he radiated.
00:02:36 But Jesus foretold that after the death of his apostles,
00:02:40 there would be a falling away from pure worship.
00:02:45 That apostasy would be so extensive
00:02:48 that genuine disciples would practically disappear
00:02:52 until “the conclusion
00:02:54 of the system of things.”
00:02:56 At the same time,
00:02:59 a counterfeit form of Christianity would flourish.
00:03:04 And so it happened.
00:03:15 So-called Christian churches deviated from Christ’s teachings.
00:03:22 The result was the abuse of power
00:03:26 and untold suffering.
00:03:33 This was a period of deep darkness.
00:03:41 In the centuries after the establishment of the Christian congregation,
00:03:46 we see how many of those
00:03:48 who were taking the lead
00:03:49 in the Christian church
00:03:50 (or, the Christian congregation)
00:03:52 likewise started to love worldly wisdom.
00:03:55 These ideas that came from Plato and other Greek philosophers
00:04:00 started to infiltrate the so-called Christian thinking.
00:04:04 And so the apostates
00:04:06 wished to blend
00:04:08 Christian teaching and Christian tradition
00:04:12 with pagan religious ideas.
00:04:15 The idea was to make these things more acceptable to other pagans
00:04:20 so that pagans could be drawn into the Christian religion.
00:04:25 As the centuries passed,
00:04:27 apostate religious leaders obscured the light even further
00:04:31 by keeping the Bible in Latin,
00:04:33 a language no longer understood by most people.
00:04:38 Yet, at certain points during this darkness,
00:04:41 there were still individuals
00:04:42 who felt keenly the need to read and understand God’s Word.
00:04:48 For example, in the 1100’s,
00:04:51 a French merchant known as Vaudès
00:04:53 commissioned a translation of Bible books into the language of the common people.
00:04:59 Two centuries later,
00:05:01 Catholic priest John Wycliffe wrote powerfully
00:05:03 against unbiblical practices of the church.
00:05:06 I demand you explain yourself!
00:05:08 By 1382, Wycliffe’s team
00:05:11 released the first translation of the Bible into English.
00:05:16 His students, known as Lollards,
00:05:19 preached the Bible’s message to anyone who would listen.
00:05:26 By 1495, the invention of movable type
00:05:30 made it possible to print all or part of the Bible
00:05:32 in 12 languages.
00:05:34 “Our Father which art in heaven . . . “
00:05:36 Soon, people were reading it for themselves.
00:05:41 And some who did began to discern
00:05:44 that the church had gone off course.
00:05:49 In the 1500’s, such men as Huldrych Zwingli,
00:05:53 Martin Luther,
00:05:55 and John Calvin
00:05:57 preached the need to return to the original principles of Christianity.
00:06:04 These men and others
00:06:05 tried to expose hypocritical practices
00:06:08 and uphold Bible teachings,
00:06:11 even though this put them at odds
00:06:13 with powerful religious authorities.
00:06:16 You can see ones
00:06:18 that were willing to stand out as being different
00:06:20 even though they didn’t have a full knowledge of the truth.
00:06:26 But standing out led to persecution,
00:06:31 and persecution often led to compromise,
00:06:36 especially when it came to preaching.
00:06:44 Nevertheless, in many lands,
00:06:46 the 1600’s and 1700’s
00:06:48 were marked by a strong upsurge in Bible study.
00:06:54 In England, many learned men
00:06:57 refuted the Trinity doctrine as unscriptural,
00:07:01 among them scientist Sir Isaac Newton,
00:07:04 poet John Milton,
00:07:07 and chemist Joseph Priestley.
00:07:10 Besides rejecting the Trinity doctrine,
00:07:13 Priestley declared that the teaching
00:07:15 of the inherent immortality of the soul was false.
00:07:18 He held that the first-century Christians had the true faith
00:07:22 and that any change to that pattern of belief was a corruption.
00:07:28 His opinions sparked a heated controversy
00:07:32 —both in the church and in the government.
00:07:37 In 1791,
00:07:40 a mob destroyed Priestley’s house and laboratory.
00:07:45 The pressure mounted for three more years
00:07:48 until he fled to the United States.
00:07:52 He was followed by many others who held his views,
00:07:55 among them Henry Grew.
00:08:00 By 1807, at age 25,
00:08:02 Grew was invited to serve as pastor
00:08:05 of the Baptist Church in Hartford, Connecticut.
00:08:09 And he had a very interesting philosophy on the study of the Bible:
00:08:14 Let Scripture interpret Scripture.
00:08:19 Grew’s point was that the Bible
00:08:22 was its own best interpreter.
00:08:25 Now, as he studied the Bible, he began to realize
00:08:28 that the doctrine of the Trinity was false.
00:08:31 Well, you couldn’t be a Baptist minister and not believe in the Trinity.
00:08:36 After four years,
00:08:38 Grew and several others withdrew from the church.
00:08:45 In later years, Grew published writings in which he used the Bible
00:08:48 to refute the Trinity, hellfire,
00:08:51 and the inherent immortality of the soul.
00:08:55 And Grew argued that immortality according to the Bible
00:08:59 is a gift that God bestows on the faithful.
00:09:03 It is not a gift that he bestows on the wicked.
00:09:08 So how could the wicked have an immortal soul?
00:09:18 Grew’s pamphlet would have far-reaching effects.
00:09:25 His work caught the attention of Methodist minister George Storrs.
00:09:31 Intrigued, Storrs spent the next three years studying the matter.
00:09:40 The Scriptures are clear on this point . . .
00:09:42 Yet, his findings met with little interest by his fellow ministers.
00:09:46 In Ezekiel 18:4:
00:09:48 “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”
00:09:52 And finally, by 1840,
00:09:55 his conscience troubled him so much
00:09:57 over the differences between what the Bible teaches
00:10:01 and what he was being obliged to teach as a Methodist Episcopal minister
00:10:06 that he resigned his position.
00:10:09 In 1842, Storrs began publishing
00:10:13 a monthly magazine entitled Bible Examiner.
00:10:18 Before long, he met Henry Grew in person.
00:10:22 The two became close friends
00:10:24 and collaborated in debates
00:10:26 against proponents of the immortal soul doctrine.
00:10:29 Yes, and that scripture, Ezekiel 18:4, that one I thought was . . .
00:10:35 George Storrs believed that in order for everyone living
00:10:38 during the time of Christ’s return
00:10:40 to have an opportunity for salvation,
00:10:43 a global preaching campaign was needed.
00:10:47 He had no idea how such a thing could be accomplished,
00:10:51 but in faith he wrote:
00:10:54 Yet, too many,
00:10:56 if they cannot see just how a thing is to be done,
00:10:59 reject it as if it were impossible for God.
00:11:09 Storrs died in 1879 at his home in Brooklyn, New York,
00:11:15 in the very neighborhood that would become the focal point
00:11:18 of the worldwide preaching work
00:11:20 he had so eagerly anticipated.
00:11:24 The stage was now set
00:11:27 for light to emerge from darkness.
00:11:47 It was in 1845
00:11:49 that Joseph and Ann Eliza Russell
00:11:52 emigrated from Ireland to Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
00:11:59 They would have five children, among them Charles Taze.
00:12:05 But times were hard.
00:12:08 His brother Thomas died at age five.
00:12:12 Before Charles turned nine,
00:12:15 two more of his siblings died.
00:12:24 Then his mother died.
00:12:28 It’s OK, Son. Everything is going to be all right.
00:12:41 That same year —1861—
00:12:44 the United States became embroiled in a civil war
00:12:47 that would send 618,000 to their graves.
00:12:58 Thousands perished on battlefields
00:13:00 not far from where the Russells lived and worked.
00:13:16 They would be able to see firsthand
00:13:19 the havoc that war wreaks on people
00:13:22 —the suffering, the death.
00:13:27 Young Charles Russell thought often about what happens to the dead.
00:13:34 Most religions held that God created man immortal
00:13:38 and that He made a fiery hell in which to torment people forever
00:13:43 —except for those predestined for salvation.
00:13:49 Russell’s feelings about such teachings came through in what he wrote.
00:13:56 A God that would use his power
00:13:58 to create human beings
00:14:00 whom he foreknew and predestinated should be eternally tormented
00:14:05 could be neither wise, just,
00:14:08 nor loving.
00:14:11 His standard would be lower than that of many men.
00:14:16 He could never reconcile
00:14:19 the teaching of eternal torment
00:14:22 with the description in the Bible of a loving God.
00:14:27 As he examined the creeds of the great churches,
00:14:30 when he saw that they taught that the wicked are tormented eternally,
00:14:34 why, he just could not accept that!
00:14:37 The whole culture,
00:14:39 the religious culture at that time,
00:14:41 was a matter of believing that God was a God of vengeance.
00:14:44 And Russell knew that the Bible said,
00:14:47 as it does at 1 John 4:8: “God is love.”
00:14:51 How could a God of love do this?
00:14:55 And so his faith wavered.
00:14:59 He felt that he could do the most good for people
00:15:01 through business and philanthropy.
00:15:04 As a preteen,
00:15:06 he became his father’s partner in a growing chain of clothing stores.
00:15:11 Charles Russell enlarged the business,
00:15:14 eventually operating a number of stores by himself.
00:15:18 Here’s your change. Thank you for coming.
00:15:23 By age 25, he possessed over three hundred thousand dollars,
00:15:28 the equivalent of seven million dollars today.
00:15:38 Yet, his search for truth continued.
00:15:50 In 1869, something happened that would help reestablish his faith.
00:16:06 Seemingly by accident one evening,
00:16:09 I dropped into a dusty, dingy hall
00:16:12 to see if the handful who met there
00:16:14 had anything more sensible to offer than the creeds of the great churches.
00:16:22 Let us take note of the words of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus himself,
00:16:26 to the apostles in . . .
00:16:28 There, for the first time,
00:16:31 I heard something of the views of Second Adventists
00:16:33 from the preacher Mr. Jonas Wendell.
00:16:36 “And he said unto them, . . .”
00:16:38 Though his Scripture exposition was not entirely clear,
00:16:41 it was sufficient, under God,
00:16:44 to reestablish my wavering faith
00:16:46 in the divine inspiration of the Bible.
00:16:50 Now, remember at this point, Russell is not an atheist
00:16:53 but he’s just discouraged.
00:16:55 He doesn’t feel the truth can be found anywhere.
00:16:58 And that sermon by a Second Adventist
00:17:02 was enough to get him to take his well-worn Bible off the shelf
00:17:06 and to start digging again.
00:17:09 As we’ve already seen, the word “Trinity” doesn’t appear anywhere in the Bible.
00:17:13 Fired with enthusiasm, Charles;
00:17:15 his father, Joseph;
00:17:18 and a few acquaintances in Pittsburgh and Allegheny
00:17:21 formed a class for Bible study.
00:17:23 They would take a subject.
00:17:25 They would get a Bible concordance.
00:17:28 They would look up every single scripture that had a bearing on the subject.
00:17:33 And then they would write down their conclusions.
00:17:35 And then they would say: ‘All right. This is what the Bible teaches.
00:17:39 We are going to believe this.’
00:17:42 Yes, and God’s Word is clear.
00:17:44 After five years of study, the religious thinking of these men
00:17:48 had undergone remarkable change.
00:17:50 Christ’s return will mean great blessings . . .
00:17:52 Their study of the Bible led them to major conclusions
00:17:55 that challenged the prevailing religious views of the day.
00:18:01 For example, while most religions taught that man has a soul,
00:18:07 Russell and his associates concluded
00:18:09 that man is a soul and that the soul can die.
00:18:15 And, whereas Christendom’s churches teach
00:18:18 that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one person,
00:18:23 these students held that Jehovah is one God
00:18:27 and not part of a Trinity.
00:18:30 In addition, while some churches
00:18:32 were teaching that Christ would return in the flesh
00:18:35 and that the earth would be destroyed,
00:18:39 this small group came to understand
00:18:41 that Christ would return invisibly
00:18:43 —in the spirit—
00:18:45 with the purpose of blessing obedient mankind.
00:18:49 So it wasn’t just philosophizing,
00:18:52 just talking about ‘what if’ or ‘perhaps this way,’
00:18:55 but they were focused on actually trying to find the truth.
00:18:59 And, the fact that they decided to write down those conclusions showed
00:19:03 that they had a belief that there is some truth to be found.
00:19:06 We see light only when it’s Jehovah’s time to reveal light.
00:19:12 And so this was the beginning of Jehovah’s time
00:19:16 to lead his people out of darkness into the wonderful light.
00:19:27 Charles Russell never professed to be divinely inspired.
00:19:31 He acknowledged the assistance he had received
00:19:35 from Jonas Wendell,
00:19:37 from George Storrs,
00:19:39 and from someone who also brought about
00:19:41 one of his greatest tests of faith,
00:19:44 Nelson Barbour, publisher of the journal
00:19:47 Herald of the Morning.
00:19:51 On a business trip, Russell received a copy of the Herald.
00:19:56 Its contents were a surprise.
00:19:59 Like Russell, Barbour held that Christ’s return would be invisible.
00:20:05 Russell arranged a meeting with Barbour.
00:20:09 Soon, Russell’s Bible study group of about 30
00:20:12 merged with Barbour’s larger group.
00:20:15 Russell contributed funds to print Herald of the Morning.
00:20:19 The business is an excellent one!
00:20:21 By this time,
00:20:22 Russell began to sell out his business interests
00:20:24 in order to preach full-time.
00:20:25 Yes, and all that is needed from me
00:20:28 is to leave this business behind and start a new life.
00:20:31 There you are.
00:20:32 Thank you.
00:20:35 And I wish you well in your new endeavors.
00:20:45 He was convinced that the presence of the Lord
00:20:47 is of utmost importance.
00:20:50 The presence of Christ is not compared to the Flood but to the days of Noah.
00:20:56 At the age of 25,
00:20:58 he went from city to city to speak at various public gatherings,
00:21:03 on the streets,
00:21:05 and to Protestant churches and their clergy.
00:21:08 He didn’t want to form another church.
00:21:10 There were already enough denominations, in his mind.
00:21:12 There he presented
00:21:14 these main Bible teachings to them
00:21:16 and urged them to study the matter
00:21:19 and then to use their pulpits to preach that message.
00:21:22 But, of course, they laughed and made fun of him and went their way.
00:21:25 And then that’s why Russell decided,
00:21:27 ‘Well, somebody has to preach these things.’
00:21:30 So he would use his time and energies to do it.
00:21:32 You would assume that being well-off,
00:21:36 he could have supported someone else.
00:21:38 He could have taken the easy way out
00:21:40 and perhaps have funded someone else to do the work.
00:21:43 He allowed his whole life to center around it.
00:21:46 By selling his business
00:21:48 and getting involved personally with it,
00:21:50 you can see the passion, the love, that he had for the truth.
00:21:59 Here’s your mail, Mr. Russell.
00:22:00 Thank you.
00:22:03 After two years of association with Nelson Barbour,
00:22:06 a dispute arose that would test the loyalty
00:22:09 of each member of the Bible study group.
00:22:13 Barbour had written an article for the Herald
00:22:15 spurning the teaching that Christ’s death could provide
00:22:18 a ransom for sinners.
00:22:21 Though professing to believe in the ransom,
00:22:23 Barbour wrote that the notion that Christ’s death paid for mankind’s sins
00:22:28 was “unscriptural, and obnoxious to all our ideas of justice.”
00:22:33 Russell, his young coeditor, disagreed.
00:22:37 Through the pages of the Herald,
00:22:39 Russell went to great lengths to defend this Bible truth.
00:22:44 Unpleasant though it be,
00:22:46 I feel it necessary to take exception
00:22:48 to an article by my brother on this subject.
00:22:51 I make the objection,
00:22:52 not from a spirit of controversy,
00:22:55 but because I believe the doctrine assailed in that article
00:22:58 to be one of the most important teachings of God’s Word.
00:23:03 Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man.
00:23:10 In the Herald, Barbour fired back.
00:23:13 I tell you such a theology is false,
00:23:16 and such justice an abhorrence to the principle of right and wrong.
00:23:23 Dismayed by Barbour’s refusal to accept this Scriptural teaching,
00:23:27 Russell asked him privately either to resign
00:23:30 or to sell his share of the paper.
00:23:34 While I still feel that you are a brother in Christ,
00:23:37 the points of variance seem to me to be so fundamental
00:23:40 and important
00:23:42 that full fellowship no longer obtains between you and me.
00:23:47 I feel that our relationship should cease.
00:23:53 After months of controversy,
00:23:55 Russell’s group withdrew from Barbour’s.
00:24:02 Eventually, Russell severed all ties with Herald of the Morning.
00:24:09 Brother Russell
00:24:11 realized that he could not restore this man’s wavering faith,
00:24:15 in fact, lack of faith.
00:24:18 And so he took it as the Lord’s will
00:24:20 that he begin to publish another magazine,
00:24:23 Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence
00:24:28 —first issue, July 1879.
00:24:34 In the same year that Thomas Edison patented the electric light,
00:24:40 Charles Russell had gone from student to publisher.
00:24:46 Thus dawned a new era
00:24:48 of both literal and spiritual light.
00:25:07 From its first installment,
00:25:09 Zion’s Watch Tower championed firm belief in the ransom.
00:25:14 Many who had associated with Nelson Barbour
00:25:17 sided with Russell on this issue.
00:25:20 In 1879 and 1880,
00:25:23 Russell and the readers of Zion’s Watch Tower
00:25:26 formed 30 congregations.
00:25:30 Those who joined them
00:25:32 became known simply as the Bible Students.
00:25:37 People who love the truth
00:25:39 want to have answers, answers to questions:
00:25:42 Who is God? Why are we here? Where are we going?
00:25:45 And they’re disillusioned by what they see in the churches.
00:25:48 And so they’re searching, and so they found something.
00:25:52 Next, Russell and other dedicated Christians
00:25:56 established a nonprofit Bible society
00:25:59 to enable them to give wider distribution
00:26:02 to Bible literature in various languages.
00:26:07 From the very beginning, it was agreed
00:26:10 that there would never be any begging or petitioning for money.
00:26:14 The work would always be advanced through voluntary donations.
00:26:21 With the annual commemoration of Christ’s death
00:26:25 came opportunities to hold large conventions.
00:26:30 In time, these were held regularly.
00:26:37 Christian baptism was customary.
00:26:44 The Bible Students sought to adhere to the Scriptural command
00:26:48 to ‘not forsake the assembling of themselves together.’
00:27:03 Another arrangement that intended to encourage
00:27:05 the small but growing number of Bible Students
00:27:08 came in 1894.
00:27:11 Traveling representatives, called pilgrims,
00:27:15 were dispatched to conduct meetings
00:27:18 and to assist these fledgling congregations.
00:27:27 About that time,
00:27:29 Russell began to publish books
00:27:31 containing the results of his Biblical research,
00:27:34 eventually writing six volumes.
00:27:38 These books came to be known as
00:27:40 Studies in the Scriptures.
00:27:45 As people read these books,
00:27:47 they were moved to share with others what they learned.
00:27:55 Obviously, people who were honesthearted
00:27:58 could hear the ring of truth.
00:28:01 They just saw that this is the truth.
00:28:03 And it was quite different
00:28:04 from what other Christian denominations
00:28:06 were teaching.
00:28:09 The impact of these volumes on the people
00:28:12 was that some
00:28:14 immediately changed things in their lives.
00:28:19 The Bible Students were putting into practice
00:28:22 what they were learning from the Scriptures.
00:28:54 In 1881,
00:28:57 the article “Wanted 1,000 Preachers”
00:28:59 invited readers of Zion’s Watch Tower
00:29:02 to distribute Bible literature publically.
00:29:07 Some full-time preachers —called colporteurs—
00:29:10 preached from house to house, bringing the message
00:29:13 directly to people’s homes.
00:29:19 The July 1881 Watch Tower
00:29:21 reminded readers that all true Christians
00:29:23 have a responsibility to preach.
00:29:28 They knew this was the truth, and they were telling people about it.
00:29:31 Just as every individual Witness today
00:29:33 knows he has the truth and he has to tell the people around him
00:29:35 —that’s what it amounts to.
00:29:39 In 1899, Zion’s Watch Tower
00:29:42 proposed a new method of preaching
00:29:44 —handing publications to people after they left church on Sunday.
00:29:49 At one stage, Russell endeavored to talk to the religious leaders.
00:29:54 He could see then that there wasn’t a chance
00:29:56 to help modify those church systems,
00:30:00 but rather it was more important
00:30:02 to approach people on an individual basis
00:30:05 and give them the opportunity.
00:30:07 You can imagine the reaction,
00:30:08 the feelings of those who would come out.
00:30:11 They had gone to an established church or religion;
00:30:14 they had seen a man who,
00:30:16 in their view, perhaps has been educated and knows what he’s talking about.
00:30:19 They go outside,
00:30:21 and here are humble people
00:30:23 trying to tell them something from the Scriptures.
00:30:25 I don’t think our work was ever intended to be confrontational,
00:30:28 but it was to draw attention to the message.
00:30:30 Confrontation came because we were there, because we were doing the work.
00:30:34 But the idea was to draw attention to what the message from the Bible is.
00:30:39 These booklets and tracts exposed the church’s departure
00:30:43 from Bible teachings.
00:30:45 And they infuriated Christendom’s clergy.
00:30:49 Now this affected
00:30:51 the money that was coming into many churches.
00:30:54 Because once people saw the truth and saw that they had been taught falsehood,
00:30:58 it was only logical that they would withdraw
00:31:01 and would not give their support
00:31:03 to religious institutions that were teaching falsehood.
00:31:08 In 1903, Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Hall
00:31:12 became the scene of a six-day debate.
00:31:16 E. L. Eaton, pastor of a Methodist-Episcopal church
00:31:19 and representing an alliance of Protestant clergymen, had one aim
00:31:24 —to destroy Russell’s influence,
00:31:27 particularly with regard to his teachings about the condition of the dead.
00:31:32 They really wanted to expose Russell
00:31:35 as a man who was ignorant of the Bible
00:31:37 and a fraud who wasn’t qualified
00:31:39 to get on a platform and preach about Bible subjects.
00:31:44 Russell really did a very good job
00:31:46 of presenting his arguments
00:31:48 and establishing Bible truths,
00:31:50 showing he was very qualified
00:31:52 to deal with Scripture.
00:31:55 People had a chance
00:31:57 not only to see the contrast between the two
00:32:01 but had a chance to see that Bible truths
00:32:04 were clear on many of those points.
00:32:08 It was reported that one clergyman who had been there to support Eaton
00:32:11 came up to Russell afterward and said:
00:32:13 “I am glad to see you turn the hose on hell and put out the fire.”
00:32:17 The local newspaper published
00:32:20 a full account of each debate the following day.
00:32:25 And then the brothers got the idea,
00:32:27 why not have Brother Russell have a sermon printed each week
00:32:31 in the newspapers simultaneously?
00:32:33 They, in turn, would telegraph the sermons out
00:32:36 to all the newspapers in the United States,
00:32:38 Canada, and even parts of Europe.
00:32:42 Russell’s sermons could be found in 2,000 newspapers,
00:32:46 reaching 15 million readers.
00:32:53 The message was spreading quickly,
00:32:56 but the Bible Students were determined
00:32:58 that it should penetrate to all corners of the earth.
00:33:02 To that end, Russell prepared an even more intensive campaign.
00:33:10 Up to 1908,
00:33:12 the work had been directed from Russell’s hometown,
00:33:15 now a part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
00:33:20 But to accomplish a more extensive, international work,
00:33:24 the headquarters, known as the Bible House, was far too small.
00:33:30 In 1908,
00:33:32 Russell dispatched J. F. Rutherford and others to New York City
00:33:36 to secure more suitable quarters.
00:33:39 The place was named Bethel, meaning “House of God.”
00:33:46 Those who lived there were called the Bethel family,
00:33:50 each a volunteer,
00:33:53 each working vigorously to shine the Bible’s light
00:33:57 into all the earth.
00:34:01 As far back as 1891,
00:34:04 Russell and some associates had been traveling to other lands
00:34:07 to help people spiritually.
00:34:09 Brothers, I would like to take our preaching worldwide.
00:34:14 One 17,000-mile journey
00:34:16 took them to Europe, Asia, and Africa.
00:34:22 One of the results of that trip was this:
00:34:27 There was a need seen for publications
00:34:30 in various languages.
00:34:32 Not long after he would visit a place,
00:34:35 you could see these groups of Bible Students start to spring up.
00:34:38 The work was starting to go international.
00:34:42 But during the years 1909 through 1912,
00:34:46 Russell intensified his efforts,
00:34:48 traveling across Europe,
00:34:54 the Middle East,
00:34:59 and eventually around the world.
00:35:09 His travels enabled him
00:35:11 to observe millions of people
00:35:15 and to see firsthand what it would really mean
00:35:19 to let the light of truth shine into all the earth.
00:35:41 By 1914, there were 5,000 Bible Students
00:35:46 preaching in 68 lands.
00:35:51 The world’s population was approaching two billion.
00:35:55 Was there a way to reach more people in less time?
00:36:01 New technologies had opened up a possibility.
00:36:10 The “Photo-Drama of Creation”
00:36:12 is presented by the IBSA,
00:36:17 the International Bible Students Association.
00:36:21 Its aim is public instruction along religio-scientific lines
00:36:26 and in defense of the Bible as the inspired Word of God.
00:36:32 The Bible Students did something that had never been done before.
00:36:37 By synchronizing slides and film footage
00:36:40 with music and dialogue, they produced
00:36:44 an eight-hour audiovisual presentation.
00:36:49 The idea was to show the development of God’s purpose
00:36:52 from the beginning of creation
00:36:56 to the Millennial Reign of Christ.
00:37:00 It was shown in two-hour segments
00:37:03 over four nights.
00:37:08 The first part dealt with each of the creative days,
00:37:19 the Flood of Noah’s day,
00:37:30 and the faith of Abraham.
00:37:37 Part 2 showed scenes of God’s dealings with ancient Israel,
00:37:44 from the Exodus
00:37:50 through the reign of the Judean kings.
00:37:56 The third segment dealt with the destruction of Solomon’s temple
00:38:02 and Messianic prophecies and their fulfillment.
00:38:22 In Part 4, viewers saw the story of the spread of Christianity,
00:38:29 the persecution that resulted,
00:38:35 and the huge populations
00:38:37 yet to be reached with the Kingdom message.
00:38:46 Showings were organized so that 80 cities could be served each day.
00:38:52 The Bible Students themselves paid all expenses needed
00:38:56 to rent suitable theaters.
00:39:02 The “Photo-Drama of Creation” was a technical feat previously unmatched.
00:39:12 It would be another decade before a full-length commercial film
00:39:16 would combine music,
00:39:20 synchronized dialogue,
00:39:23 and color footage.
00:39:30 In just one year,
00:39:33 nine million people around the earth
00:39:35 had seen the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
00:39:45 And many who saw it
00:39:47 were convinced that they had discovered the path of increasing light.
00:40:12 In 1876, Russell had written an article
00:40:16 in Bible Examiner
00:40:17 entitled “Gentile Times: When Do They End?”
00:40:21 in which he stated
00:40:23 that the “seven times” will end in 1914.
00:40:29 Russell concluded
00:40:31 on the basis of the tree dream
00:40:33 recorded in Daniel chapter 4
00:40:35 that the dynasty that began with King David
00:40:39 would be restored
2,520 years after its overthrow.
00:40:48 During those years,
00:40:50 no Davidic king would rule.
00:40:53 The Bible Students referred to that period
00:40:56 as “the Gentile Times.”
00:41:00 What would happen at the end of those years?
00:41:05 They reasoned that since Jesus
00:41:07 is the only one qualified to assume the throne of David,
00:41:11 then Christ himself would begin ruling in 1914.
00:41:18 What would that mean for the earth?
00:41:22 Reasoning on Daniel chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 24,
00:41:27 the Bible Students preached that a time of global anarchy would come,
00:41:31 which would culminate in the end of the system of things.
00:41:35 They believed that about that time,
00:41:37 the congregation would be taken to heaven.
00:41:41 They realized that 1914 had a significance,
00:41:44 that it meant the end of the Gentile Times.
00:41:47 Now, at that time, they felt that perhaps the work would be finished
00:41:51 and that they would go home, as it were.
00:41:54 So they were looking forward to a time of reward.
00:41:57 They did understand that there was a significance to the year.
00:42:00 Primarily, they thought that 1914 would just be the start
00:42:05 of the judgment coming upon the world, or Armageddon.
00:42:12 Yet, people in general were anticipating a different sort of future.
00:42:19 Many who wrote memoirs about the summer of 1914
00:42:23 described it as one of “exceptional tranquility,”
00:42:27 “full of hope and promise.”
00:42:32 Some analysts felt that in 1914,
00:42:34 conditions were better than ever for achieving world peace.
00:42:41 What the Bible Students had been preaching about global anarchy
00:42:45 seemed highly unlikely.
00:42:48 But the Bible Students
00:42:50 counted the days and continued working.
00:42:56 Then, on June 28, 1914,
00:42:59 Austria-Hungary’s crown prince and his wife were murdered.
00:43:07 His assassin fired the shots
00:43:09 that began the bloodiest war mankind had yet experienced.
00:43:28 Notions of tranquility were shattered
00:43:31 as nation after nation became enmeshed
00:43:35 in “the Great War.”
00:43:49 These and other historical events
00:43:51 matched what Jesus said would characterize
00:43:54 “the conclusion of the system of things.”
00:44:03 When World War I broke out in July,
00:44:06 they felt vindicated.
00:44:07 It strengthened their faith in the Bible,
00:44:09 in Jehovah’s prophetic Word,
00:44:11 but also, it enhanced their trust that Jehovah was using
00:44:15 Brother Russell and his friends to explain truth to others.
00:44:30 At Brooklyn Bethel on October 2, 1914,
00:44:34 Charles Russell made a monumental announcement.
00:44:38 The Gentile Times have ended;
00:44:40 their kings have had their day!
00:44:47 Expectations were still running high.
00:44:51 Many of the Bible Students were hoping for an immediate heavenly reward.
00:44:56 Now I just might say that my mother,
00:44:59 she was ready to sell up everything in the home
00:45:03 because she thought
00:45:04 that the end was coming in 1914,
00:45:06 and her feelings were that
00:45:08 of a lot of the brothers back there.
00:45:13 Despite such expectations,
00:45:15 the distressing world conditions that erupted in 1914
00:45:20 would not mean that the Bible Students’ job was done.
00:45:26 Russell felt sure that a great work remained.
00:45:31 He wrote:
00:45:34 We should lose no time dreaming that the door is shut!
00:45:38 There are people who are seeking the Truth
00:45:42 —people who are sitting in darkness.
00:45:47 —The Watch Tower,  February 15, 1915.
00:45:54 Yet, Russell would not personally reach those people.
00:46:01 In 1916, in the course of a preaching tour,
00:46:05 he died at the age of 64.
00:46:13 He had spent his entire fortune preaching the Bible’s message.
00:46:25 Whereas the majority of the Bible Students
00:46:28 kept studying the Bible and sharing its message,
00:46:32 others simply could not overcome their disappointments
00:46:40 —disappointment that 1914
00:46:43 did not fulfill all their expectations
00:46:47 compounded by natural grief over Russell’s death.
00:46:55 Well, it was a big shock
00:46:58 because they were used to his taking the lead,
00:47:00 and they figured he was going to take the lead
00:47:02 until the Lord came and took them all to heaven.
00:47:05 And they just didn’t know what to do for a while.
00:47:08 They were totally shocked as to how to carry on.
00:47:15 Some would sever all association with the Bible Students
00:47:19 and attempt to draw others after them.
00:47:23 What would happen to the Bible Students?
00:47:27 Would they disperse as if followers of Russell?
00:47:32 This is not a work of man.
00:47:36 This is a work of Jehovah God.
00:47:39 It’s evident that Jehovah had already chosen this organization
00:47:44 because of the faithfulness and the sincerity of the men who were behind it.
00:47:49 It was obvious that Jehovah had already chosen this organization
00:47:52 to get his work done.
00:47:54 There were enough honesthearted men
00:47:56 hungering for the truth,
00:47:58 desirous of doing the will of God,
00:48:00 to prevent the organization from collapsing.
00:48:05 Rather than giving in to disappointment
00:48:08 over what did not happen in 1914,
00:48:12 the Bible Students kept their minds open
00:48:14 to the significance of what had taken place.
00:48:22 The world war and its aftermath
00:48:24 had become the world-shaking events
00:48:26 proclaimed by Russell almost 40 years earlier.
00:48:32 The Bible Students were coming to the realization
00:48:35 that Christ’s presence had begun in 1914,
00:48:39 and that the world’s last days were underway!
00:48:45 Two months after Russell’s death,
00:48:48 Joseph Rutherford was appointed to oversee the work.
00:48:54 Rutherford had been a close associate of Russell,
00:48:57 traveling with him
00:48:59 and speaking in his defense.
00:49:03 Like Russell, he believed that the good news had to be preached.
00:49:08 He was dynamic
00:49:11 and could not be intimidated.
00:49:15 Yet, not everyone appreciated these traits
00:49:19 —even among the Bible Students.
00:49:21 Brother Rutherford,
00:49:23 he was an entirely different personality,
00:49:26 brusque in manner,
00:49:29 and he didn’t fear to tread on anyone’s toes.
00:49:34 I think this was a tremendous test on the brothers
00:49:38 because they really had been worshipping the creature
00:49:42 more than the Creator.
00:49:46 Rutherford directed that Russell’s notes
00:49:48 for a seventh volume of Studies in the Scriptures
00:49:51 be compiled into a new book called The Finished Mystery.
00:49:58 On the day that the book was completed
00:50:00 and he had a supply in his office,
00:50:02 he arranged for brothers to put one
00:50:05 at each place at the tables in the dining room.
00:50:09 And so, when the family came down to eat,
00:50:11 each one had a copy
00:50:13 of the book The Finished Mystery.
00:50:15 Some were quite curious about it and wondered what it was all about
00:50:18 and enthused about it.
00:50:20 But there was already a growing tension in the family
00:50:23 because some of the responsible brothers
00:50:25 sort of resented Brother Rutherford.
00:50:27 Some of them had ambitions for themselves.
00:50:30 So they used the occasion to bring accusations against Brother Rutherford
00:50:33 for having gone ahead and published this without their permission and their knowledge.
00:50:38 And the result was, eventually,
00:50:39 about a five-hour tirade against Brother Rutherford,
00:50:42 where a number brought a lot of unjust accusations against him.
00:50:49 Brother Macmillan tells that, well, that day,
00:50:51 they left the dining room and most of the food was uneaten
00:50:54 and the family was very sad.
00:50:57 But in the community at large,
00:50:59 people were taking note of The Finished Mystery.
00:51:03 They originally planned on a distribution
00:51:06 of about less than a hundred thousand.
00:51:07 And, within a short time,
00:51:09 over 850,000 copies had to be printed.
00:51:15 The clergy hated the book!
00:51:19 It exposed their unscriptural teachings and practices.
00:51:23 And it publicly condemned them
00:51:26 for their involvement in the world war.
00:51:29 The clergy fought back!
00:51:34 Using the heightened patriotism of wartime to their advantage,
00:51:38 they falsely accused the Bible Students
00:51:41 of sedition,
00:51:43 espionage,
00:51:46 and treason,
00:51:49 and they urged the U.S. government
00:51:51 to halt their work.
00:51:57 On May 8, 1918,
00:52:00 Joseph Rutherford and seven of his associates were arrested.
00:52:16 On June 20, they were convicted on four counts of sedition.
00:52:26 July 4, 1918,
00:52:29 Rutherford and his associates were transported
00:52:32 to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia.
00:52:34 The sentence?
00:52:36 Twenty years in prison:
00:52:40 George Fisher,
00:52:43 Hugh Macmillan,
00:52:47 Robert Martin,
00:52:50 Frederick Robison,
00:52:54 Joseph Rutherford,
00:52:58 William Van Amburgh,
00:53:02 Clayton Woodworth.
00:53:06 Sentenced to ten years in prison:
00:53:10 Giovanni DeCecca.
00:53:18 It was quite a shock to them to be put in prison.
00:53:22 Did they do something
00:53:24 that they shouldn’t have done?
00:53:26 Was the Lord displeased with them?
00:53:28 Or was the Lord permitting it?
00:53:30 They just didn’t know.
00:53:32 The Devil stirs up people to oppose us either directly or indirectly.
00:53:36 Now, the charge of sedition is one
00:53:39 that has often been used against Jehovah’s people.
00:53:43 This is just another ploy.
00:53:45 Those brothers certainly were not going around
00:53:48 trying to undermine the U.S. government.
00:53:52 On August 26, 1918,
00:53:55 Brooklyn headquarters was shut down.
00:53:59 Operations were moved back to Pittsburgh.
00:54:05 In the minds of the clergy,
00:54:07 the voice of the Bible Students had been silenced.
00:54:29 On November 11, 1918, the world war ended.
00:54:46 Prisoners of war were being released;
00:54:51 Rutherford and his associates were not.
00:54:56 It appeared that their opponents had succeeded.
00:55:02 The Bible Students circulated a petition for the release of the eight men
00:55:07 and obtained 700,000 signatures!
00:55:13 On March 12, 1919,
00:55:15 Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States,
00:55:18 conceded that the prison terms were excessive.
00:55:24 On March 26, all eight men were released.
00:55:28 The charges were later dropped.
00:55:30 The Lord was preparing them for the future.
00:55:34 It was going to be a battle
00:55:36 with the political, religious, and commercial world,
00:55:39 and Brother Rutherford
00:55:42 was geared up and trained for that after he got out.
00:55:46 Upon their release, the men were consumed with zeal.
00:55:51 Within six months, headquarters was moved back to Brooklyn
00:55:55 and arrangements were made for a convention at Cedar Point, Ohio.
00:56:01 It was here that they launched a companion magazine to The Watch Tower
00:56:05 called The Golden Age.
00:56:08 Its purpose?
00:56:10 To explain the meaning of world events
00:56:13 and to inspire hope in the supreme remedy.
00:56:17 Rutherford and his associates had only just been released from prison.
00:56:22 And then within a couple of months,
00:56:25 they organized this tremendous convention,
00:56:28 and then announced the release of a new magazine—The Golden Age.
00:56:31 Now, that’s something that really is unbelievable.
00:56:36 You go from one situation where there is hardly anything happening.
00:56:40 The next thing, it’s just full speed ahead.
00:56:44 On September 8, 1922,
00:56:47 another convention was held at Cedar Point.
00:56:51 Here, Rutherford gave what would become
00:56:53 perhaps his most memorable speech.
00:56:58 Do you believe that the King of glory has begun his reign?
00:57:02 Yes!
00:57:05 Then back to the field!
00:57:07 The world must know
00:57:09 that Jehovah is God
00:57:11 and that Jesus Christ
00:57:13 is King of kings and Lord of lords.
00:57:18 This is the day of all days.
00:57:20 Behold, the King reigns!
00:57:24 You are his publicity agents.
00:57:30 Therefore advertise,
00:57:33 advertise,
00:57:35 advertise, the King and his kingdom.
00:57:55 And “advertise” they did.
00:58:02 Well, it must have been daunting
00:58:03 for them to contemplate the world
00:58:05 as their territory
00:58:07 with a few thousand harvest workers.
00:58:10 They knew Jehovah would help them; they knew others would join them.
00:58:14 So they knew the work would expand.
00:58:16 You could imagine someone sitting there and saying,
00:58:19 ‘How on earth would you ever get this done?’
00:58:22 And that would seem to be quite a sensible question.
00:58:25 But those brothers weren’t concerned with that.
00:58:28 They had full faith in Jehovah.
00:58:30 Well, our focus at the time
00:58:32 in view of Brother Rutherford’s talk
00:58:35 was that we’ve got something to do
00:58:38 and we’ve got to finish a work that we’ve been entrusted with.
00:58:42 And our focus was to get on with the job
00:58:46 and fulfill our commission as his servants here on the earth.
00:58:50 Like some who had gone before them,
00:58:53 these students of the Bible
00:58:55 had the courage to walk away from false beliefs.
00:59:02 Yet, they were different in that they stuck together.
00:59:07 And they refused to stop preaching,
00:59:12 even in the face of serious opposition.
00:59:18 Because of their endurance,
00:59:20 they continued to know the profound joy of having emerged from darkness.
00:59:29 Now a huge work lay ahead of them.
00:59:35 Their future would be one of increasing sacrifice
00:59:41 and great accomplishment.
00:59:49 But their faith that Christ had begun ruling,
00:59:54 coupled with their appreciation for Jehovah’s direction and backing
01:00:00 gave them the courage they would need
01:00:04 to let the light of truth shine
01:00:06 into all the earth.
