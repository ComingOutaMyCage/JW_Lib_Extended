Another great example
of Jehovah guiding his servants

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the construction
of the Wallkill Bethel complex

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:09.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
here in the United States.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before that location was acquired and built,

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization owned another property
outside of New York City

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
called Kingdom Farm.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s actually where the Gilead School
was held at the time.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the location was not ideal,

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:28.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Brother George Couch
was assigned to find a new property

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
that later became Wallkill Bethel.

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Couch served
at the world headquarters

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
until his death in 2007.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy listening
to his account of what happened

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
—told in a way
that only our dear Brother Couch could.

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr said
in around the early 1960’s sometime

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
about looking at getting another farm

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:58.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
closer to New York
so we didn’t have to travel so far.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one cold Saturday morning,
I called Brother Larson

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I said, “Brother Larson,
do you want to take a trip with me?”

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:09.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “I’ll go with you.”

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t tell him where I was going.

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:15.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we came up here to the Gobel place,

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:19.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I came up
with the intention of asking Brother Gobel

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he’d advise us
to look for buying a farm,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so we got here about ten o’clock.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was cold.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had finished the barn work,
and we came in the house

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:35.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had a cup of coffee
and had a bite of breakfast with them.

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:38.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, they kept looking at us

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
wondering, ‘What in the world
are you doing up here?’

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so finally we said,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’re thinking of getting a farm

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:49.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“closer to New York than Kingdom Farm

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thought maybe you’d have some ideas,”

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:55.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it just stunned them.

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
They looked at one another,
and then they looked at us.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought,
‘What in the world did we say wrong?’

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:06.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said, “You know,
yesterday we put this farm up for sale.”

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:10.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were the buyers of it,

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:13.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we had no workers.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so one Tuesday morning,

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr and Brother Larson and I

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
were coming up here to the farm

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we brought up the subject

00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:27.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
of where we were going to get help.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr made this suggestion,

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, why don’t you bring in
some circuit and district overseers

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and call them in for a short time

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have them help?”

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:45.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we had the file with us
of the circuit and district overseers,

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:50.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
so on our way up, we picked out
50 circuit and district overseers.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wrote them a letter and told them

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was a special assignment;

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would only last about six months.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t have a typewriter;
we didn’t have a computer;

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t have blueprints.

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:08.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we started the job,

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:13.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Dexter Busching
bought himself a calculator

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:17.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do the stressing and straining
—the figuring work on it—

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s how we built the building.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
The schedule was from daylight to dark.

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:27.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
We set up a temporary kitchen
in the farmhouse

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fed cafeteria style,
which worked out quite well.

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers ate on the porch
and out in the yard

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
—wherever they could sit down.

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:42.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got the basement in on the farm building,

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the brothers put beds in there.

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:47.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was makeshift.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had everything but tents.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d say most
of our pick-and-shovel brothers

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
slept in the corn cribs;

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:58.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
they slept in the haymow;

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
they slept anywhere they could put a bunk up.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the brothers at Brooklyn Bethel

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 25 years or more seniority

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:10.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
were invited to come up,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:13.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had a nice steak meal for us.

00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:18.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr gave the dedication talk,

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:21.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he called on Brother Franz

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say a few words.

00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:27.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Franz got up,

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he started back in the garden of Eden
with Adam and Eve.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what he was saying
was that man started off as a farmer,

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:40.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he sort of developed that
to a certain extent.

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:44.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, I came up here every week,

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt, for the next 10 to 15 years.

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:54.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw the brothers turn this piece of ground

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:58.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a junkyard to a paradise it is today.

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:02.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
That started the Society
in their construction work

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our own construction work.

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we built several other buildings
after that.

00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw that we could do it.

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the interesting thing is
it wasn’t long after that

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
we started to send the brothers

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
into foreign lands

00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:23.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help the brothers build
the branch homes, missionary homes,

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kingdom Halls.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:28.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just to be honest with it,
we had to get out of New York.

00:05:28.444 --> 00:05:32.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our buildings weren’t big enough

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:34.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the modern presses;

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
they weren’t high enough.

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:39.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
The weight limit on buildings
wouldn’t hold them.

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:44.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
You couldn’t buy land in New York City

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put up a building like you have there;

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:52.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was almost an impossibility.

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:54.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there was only one thing to do.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our presses were old,
and we had to replace them.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no place in New York to put them.

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:03.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
We looked for land,
but we couldn’t find any place.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Lord just drove us up here.

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:09.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you look back over things,
sometimes you think,

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My, someone had some wise thinking

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
and good foresight.’

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the Lord’s spirit did.

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:20.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Lord is running the organization.

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a theocratic organization.

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:26.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it’s surprising
where the idea comes from

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:27.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what you’re going to do.

00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:32.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry about what it’s going to be like
after Armageddon.

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:36.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be just the way we want it
because the Lord is going to do it.

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Lord didn’t see fit
to put it in the Bible.

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:40.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t need to know now.

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:42.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got our hands full now just preaching.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
What the Lord has in mind for the future,
who knows?
