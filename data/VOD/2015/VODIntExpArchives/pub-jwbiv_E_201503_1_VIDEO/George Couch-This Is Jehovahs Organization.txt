00:00:02 Another great example of Jehovah guiding his servants
00:00:05 is the construction of the Wallkill Bethel complex
00:00:07 here in the United States.
00:00:09 Before that location was acquired and built,
00:00:12 the organization owned another property outside of New York City
00:00:16 called Kingdom Farm.
00:00:18 That’s actually where the Gilead School was held at the time.
00:00:22 But the location was not ideal,
00:00:24 so Brother George Couch was assigned to find a new property
00:00:28 that later became Wallkill Bethel.
00:00:31 Brother Couch served at the world headquarters
00:00:33 until his death in 2007.
00:00:36 Please enjoy listening to his account of what happened
00:00:39 —told in a way that only our dear Brother Couch could.
00:00:45 Brother Knorr said in around the early 1960’s sometime
00:00:50 about looking at getting another farm
00:00:54 closer to New York so we didn’t have to travel so far.
00:00:59 So one cold Saturday morning, I called Brother Larson
00:01:04 and I said, “Brother Larson, do you want to take a trip with me?”
00:01:07 He said, “I’ll go with you.”
00:01:09 I didn’t tell him where I was going.
00:01:11 So we came up here to the Gobel place,
00:01:15 and I came up with the intention of asking Brother Gobel
00:01:19 where he’d advise us to look for buying a farm,
00:01:23 and so we got here about ten o’clock.
00:01:26 It was cold.
00:01:28 They had finished the barn work, and we came in the house
00:01:31 and had a cup of coffee and had a bite of breakfast with them.
00:01:36 And, of course, they kept looking at us
00:01:38 wondering, ‘What in the world are you doing up here?’
00:01:40 And so finally we said,
00:01:43 “We’re thinking of getting a farm
00:01:46 “closer to New York than Kingdom Farm
00:01:49 and thought maybe you’d have some ideas,”
00:01:54 and it just stunned them.
00:01:55 They looked at one another, and then they looked at us.
00:01:58 And I thought, ‘What in the world did we say wrong?’
00:02:02 And she said, “You know, yesterday we put this farm up for sale.”
00:02:07 And we were the buyers of it,
00:02:10 but we had no workers.
00:02:13 And so one Tuesday morning,
00:02:16 Brother Knorr and Brother Larson and I
00:02:19 were coming up here to the farm
00:02:22 and we brought up the subject
00:02:25 of where we were going to get help.
00:02:27 Brother Knorr made this suggestion,
00:02:29 “Well, why don’t you bring in some circuit and district overseers
00:02:34 “and call them in for a short time
00:02:38 and have them help?”
00:02:40 And so we had the file with us of the circuit and district overseers,
00:02:45 so on our way up, we picked out
50 circuit and district overseers.
00:02:50 We wrote them a letter and told them
00:02:52 that it was a special assignment;
00:02:57 it would only last about six months.
00:02:59 We didn’t have a typewriter; we didn’t have a computer;
00:03:03 we didn’t have blueprints.
00:03:05 When we started the job,
00:03:08 Brother Dexter Busching bought himself a calculator
00:03:13 to do the stressing and straining —the figuring work on it—
00:03:17 and that’s how we built the building.
00:03:20 The schedule was from daylight to dark.
00:03:22 We set up a temporary kitchen in the farmhouse
00:03:29 and fed cafeteria style, which worked out quite well.
00:03:33 The brothers ate on the porch and out in the yard
00:03:36 —wherever they could sit down.
00:03:38 We got the basement in on the farm building,
00:03:42 and the brothers put beds in there.
00:03:44 So it was makeshift.
00:03:47 We had everything but tents.
00:03:49 And I’d say most of our pick-and-shovel brothers
00:03:53 slept in the corn cribs;
00:03:56 they slept in the haymow;
00:03:58 they slept anywhere they could put a bunk up.
00:04:01 All the brothers at Brooklyn Bethel
00:04:04 with 25 years or more seniority
00:04:07 were invited to come up,
00:04:10 and they had a nice steak meal for us.
00:04:14 Brother Knorr gave the dedication talk,
00:04:18 and then he called on Brother Franz
00:04:21 to say a few words.
00:04:25 And Brother Franz got up,
00:04:27 and he started back in the garden of Eden with Adam and Eve.
00:04:31 And what he was saying was that man started off as a farmer,
00:04:36 and he sort of developed that to a certain extent.
00:04:40 After that, I came up here every week,
00:04:44 no doubt, for the next 10 to 15 years.
00:04:49 I saw the brothers turn this piece of ground
00:04:54 from a junkyard to a paradise it is today.
00:04:58 That started the Society in their construction work
00:05:02 —our own construction work.
00:05:04 Then we built several other buildings after that.
00:05:08 We saw that we could do it.
00:05:10 And the interesting thing is it wasn’t long after that
00:05:13 we started to send the brothers
00:05:16 into foreign lands
00:05:18 to help the brothers build the branch homes, missionary homes,
00:05:23 Kingdom Halls.
00:05:25 Just to be honest with it, we had to get out of New York.
00:05:28 Our buildings weren’t big enough
00:05:32 to take the modern presses;
00:05:34 they weren’t high enough.
00:05:36 The weight limit on buildings wouldn’t hold them.
00:05:42 You couldn’t buy land in New York City
00:05:44 to put up a building like you have there;
00:05:48 it was almost an impossibility.
00:05:52 So there was only one thing to do.
00:05:54 Our presses were old, and we had to replace them.
00:05:57 There was no place in New York to put them.
00:06:00 We looked for land, but we couldn’t find any place.
00:06:03 The Lord just drove us up here.
00:06:06 When you look back over things, sometimes you think,
00:06:09 ‘My, someone had some wise thinking
00:06:12 and good foresight.’
00:06:15 No, the Lord’s spirit did.
00:06:18 The Lord is running the organization.
00:06:20 It’s a theocratic organization.
00:06:22 Sometimes it’s surprising where the idea comes from
00:06:26 on what you’re going to do.
00:06:27 Don’t worry about what it’s going to be like after Armageddon.
00:06:32 It will be just the way we want it because the Lord is going to do it.
00:06:36 The Lord didn’t see fit to put it in the Bible.
00:06:38 We don’t need to know now.
00:06:40 We got our hands full now just preaching.
00:06:43 What the Lord has in mind for the future, who knows?
