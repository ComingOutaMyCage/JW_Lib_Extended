00:00:01 WBBR radio, and stations like it,
00:00:04 was a way for the small number of Kingdom proclaimers
00:00:07 to reach millions in populated areas with the good news.
00:00:11 In an archived interview, Brother Robert Hatzfeld
00:00:14 explains his privilege to have been part of that historic method of preaching.
00:00:21 I was born in 1903,
00:00:26 in Pittsburg, in Alleghany.
00:00:29 And it’s been a very, very interesting lifetime I’ve had
00:00:33 down through these years.
00:00:37 The group that I was in in the neighborhood,
00:00:40 two of us decided we were going to go to sea
00:00:42 as radio operators on ships.
00:00:45 In order to get the license, we had to be able
00:00:48 to send and receive telegraph messages.
00:00:51 And so the two of us came to New York,
00:00:55 and we went to the RCA School
00:00:58 to learn the telegraph.
00:01:01 When I was going to school then, and living on Manhattan,
00:01:06 I was going to the meetings.
00:01:08 Was only one meeting at that time
00:01:10 for, the, all the brothers throughout the whole metropolitan area
00:01:13 —inside and outside the city—
00:01:15 in the rented hall, in the Masonic Temple.
00:01:17 That’s still down here in Lafayette Avenue.
00:01:21 It was a New York Church of International Bible Students.
00:01:25 And when I told the brothers
00:01:28 that I was figuring on going to sea as a telegraph operator,
00:01:32 they said: “Well, why go to sea?
00:01:35 We have a radio station.”
00:01:37 So, then,
00:01:41 a little later I came over to Bethel, here,
00:01:44 to see what it was all about,
00:01:47 and a brother, one of Brother Rutherford’s secretaries,
00:01:52 Brother Hazlet came out and interviewed me.
00:01:57 And I was told that I should finish the course,
00:02:00 get my license, and then come over.
00:02:02 So that’s how I got to Bethel.
00:02:05 I got my license in December, came to Bethel,
00:02:09 and got involved in any kind of electrical work, anything at all,
00:02:14 and operating the radio transmitter.
00:02:19 Brother Rutherford had broadcast in Philadelphia,
00:02:23 from the Opera House, about 1921.
00:02:28 And he and other elders
00:02:31 decided that this was Jehovah’s provision.
00:02:34 Radio was Jehovah’s provision, to get this truth spread out.
00:02:39 There was no way for a couple hundred Witnesses to witness
00:02:43 to the millions and millions of people
00:02:45 in the metropolitan area; let alone the world.
00:02:49 So they decided
00:02:52 that since you couldn’t go out and buy a radio station,
00:02:57 we’ll build one.
00:02:58 And they got together
00:03:02 and they bought the wilderness on Staten Island.
00:03:07 That needed to be cleaned out
00:03:10 —all the brush cleaned out, land leveled off.
00:03:14 And we’re gonna build a radio station.
00:03:17 So they built a big house, really big house.
00:03:21 That proved to be very useful down through the years.
00:03:26 So they built another smaller building
00:03:31 alongside of the house.
00:03:33 They had the radio transmitter in one end of it,
00:03:37 and then the studio in the same building.
00:03:41 In the spring of 1924,
00:03:43 the first program was put on.
00:03:48 The programs were made up by using
00:03:50 all of the things that the Society published
00:03:54 —were used in some kind of a program.
00:03:57 We had all kinds of programs.
00:03:59 We had to put on some music,
00:04:01 and we had real good music.
00:04:04 And we had a seven-piece orchestra that would play
00:04:08 on an everyday program.
00:04:10 And then we had the augmented orchestra,
00:04:15 brothers coming out from Bethel and playing over the weekend.
00:04:27 We had bought a used transmitter, five hundred watts,
00:04:31 to get started.
00:04:33 And that was enough power,
00:04:38 with that single wire antenna,
00:04:41 that in the early days
00:04:45 that was heard all over
00:04:47 —over a very, very large area
00:04:49 because there wasn’t many stations,
00:04:52 and there wasn’t much electrical interference.
00:04:56 But then, this first transmitter
00:05:00 was replaced in 1927
00:05:04 by a brand new Western Electric transmitter, of a thousand watts.
00:05:09 That made a considerable increase
00:05:11 in our territory that we were covering.
00:05:15 With very little interference, why then,
00:05:18 people would sit down with earphones
00:05:20 and try to receive distant programs,
00:05:23 and pay attention.
00:05:25 When they heard something good, that they were interested in,
00:05:28 they really paid attention
00:05:30 because there wasn’t a whole lot of other things
00:05:33 to distract them and take them away from it.
00:05:36 That was an evening’s entertainment
00:05:38 —to sit down and listen to the radio.
00:05:40 The commercial programs, of course, were,
00:05:46 some of them were interesting,
00:05:49 but the Bible message appealed to a lot of people in those days.
00:05:54 This message was a life-giving message that we had.
00:05:58 Was a matter of life and death, really.
00:06:03 And we know that without Jehovah’s help, why nothing would’ve happened.
00:06:08 So it worked out very well, right from the beginning,
00:06:12 that we were broadcasting
00:06:15 the message of the Kingdom over the radio.
00:06:26 Brother Hatzfeld served at Bethel for almost 75 years
00:06:30 before finishing his earthly course in 2001,
00:06:33 at the age of 98.
