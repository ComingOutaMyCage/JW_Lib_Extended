WBBR radio, and stations like it,

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a way for the small number
of Kingdom proclaimers

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach millions in populated areas
with the good news.

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an archived interview,
Brother Robert Hatzfeld

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
explains his privilege to have been part
of that historic method of preaching.

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:26.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born in 1903,

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Pittsburg, in Alleghany.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:33.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s been
a very, very interesting lifetime I’ve had

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:35.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
down through these years.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
The group that I was in in the neighborhood,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
two of us decided we were going to go to sea

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
as radio operators on ships.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to get the license,
we had to be able

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send and receive telegraph messages.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:55.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the two of us came to New York,

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:58.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we went to the RCA School

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn the telegraph.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:06.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was going to school then,
and living on Manhattan,

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was going to the meetings.

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was only one meeting at that time

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
for, the, all the brothers
throughout the whole metropolitan area

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
—inside and outside the city—

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the rented hall, in the Masonic Temple.

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:20.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s still down here in Lafayette Avenue.

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:25.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a New York Church
of International Bible Students.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I told the brothers

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:32.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was figuring on going to sea
as a telegraph operator,

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
they said: “Well, why go to sea?

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:37.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a radio station.”

00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:41.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then,

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:44.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little later I came over to Bethel, here,

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what it was all about,

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a brother,
one of Brother Rutherford’s secretaries,

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:55.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Hazlet came out and interviewed me.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was told
that I should finish the course,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
get my license, and then come over.

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:04.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s how I got to Bethel.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:09.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got my license in December, came to Bethel,

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:14.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got involved in any kind
of electrical work, anything at all,

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:17.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and operating the radio transmitter.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:23.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford had broadcast
in Philadelphia,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Opera House, about 1921.

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:31.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he and other elders

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:34.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
decided that this was Jehovah’s provision.

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:39.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Radio was Jehovah’s provision,
to get this truth spread out.

00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:43.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no way
for a couple hundred Witnesses to witness

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the millions and millions of people

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the metropolitan area;
let alone the world.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they decided

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
that since you couldn’t go out
and buy a radio station,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll build one.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they got together

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they bought the wilderness
on Staten Island.

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
That needed to be cleaned out

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all the brush cleaned out, land leveled off.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re gonna build a radio station.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they built a big house, really big house.

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
That proved to be very useful
down through the years.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they built another smaller building

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
alongside of the house.

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had the radio transmitter
in one end of it,

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:40.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the studio in the same building.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:43.740 line:10% position:50% align:center
In the spring of 1924,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
the first program was put on.

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:50.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
The programs were made up by using

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the things that the Society published

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
—were used in some kind of a program.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had all kinds of programs.

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:01.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to put on some music,

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had real good music.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:08.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had a seven-piece orchestra
that would play

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:10.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
on an everyday program.

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we had the augmented orchestra,

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:19.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers coming out from Bethel
and playing over the weekend.

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:31.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had bought a used transmitter,
five hundred watts,

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get started.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was enough power,

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:41.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that single wire antenna,

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in the early days

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was heard all over

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
—over a very, very large area

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there wasn’t many stations,

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there wasn’t
much electrical interference.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, this first transmitter

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
was replaced in 1927

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a brand new Western Electric transmitter,
of a thousand watts.

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
That made a considerable increase

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our territory that we were covering.

00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:18.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
With very little interference, why then,

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
people would sit down with earphones

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to receive distant programs,

00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:25.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pay attention.

00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:28.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they heard something good,
that they were interested in,

00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:30.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
they really paid attention

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:33.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there wasn’t
a whole lot of other things

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:36.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
to distract them and take them away from it.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was an evening’s entertainment

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to sit down and listen to the radio.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The commercial programs, of course, were,

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of them were interesting,

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the Bible message appealed
to a lot of people in those days.

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:58.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
This message was a life-giving message
that we had.

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:03.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was a matter of life and death, really.

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that without Jehovah’s help,
why nothing would’ve happened.

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:12.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it worked out very well,
right from the beginning,

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we were broadcasting

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
the message of the Kingdom over the radio.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:30.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Hatzfeld served at Bethel
for almost 75 years

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
before finishing his earthly course in 2001,

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:35.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the age of 98.
