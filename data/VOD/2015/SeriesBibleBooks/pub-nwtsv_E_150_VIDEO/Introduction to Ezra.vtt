00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:04.984 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to the book of Ezra.

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book was written by Ezra,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
a priest from the family line of Aaron.

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra was a man of faith

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:16.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made a diligent study of the Scriptures

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as a priest, had the responsibility

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach God’s Word to others.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was also a skilled copyist,

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
a job that required
meticulous attention to detail.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
This thoroughly researched account

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
picks up right where he concluded

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:35.264 line:10% position:50% align:center
the book of 2 Chronicles,

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.808 line:10% position:50% align:center
following the Jewish captivity in Babylon.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.854 line:10% position:50% align:center
He wrote this book in about 460 B.C.E.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:43.564 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Jerusalem.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
The books of Ezra and Nehemiah

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
were combined on one scroll?

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, though, the scroll was divided

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the two books we have
in our Bibles today.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Ezra contains ten chapters.

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 1 through 6 describe the return

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a small group of Jews to Jerusalem.

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:11.383 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 537 B.C.E., they rebuilt the altar

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:13.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
and celebrated the Festival of Booths,

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:17.264 line:10% position:50% align:center
thus ending the 70-year desolation.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.351 line:10% position:50% align:center
In the following year,

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.520 line:10% position:50% align:center
the foundation of the temple was laid,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.230 line:10% position:50% align:center
and although opposition

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.025 line:10% position:50% align:center
halted the work for a time,

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.276 line:10% position:50% align:center
the house of Jehovah

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.071 line:10% position:50% align:center
was completed by 515 B.C.E.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.325 line:10% position:50% align:center
In chapters 7 to 10,

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:38.702 line:10% position:50% align:center
we jump forward almost 50 years

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:40.579 line:10% position:50% align:center
to 468 B.C.E.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.414 line:10% position:50% align:center
as Ezra recounts

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.167 line:10% position:50% align:center
his own perilous journey to Jerusalem.

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:49.713 line:10% position:50% align:center
Upon arrival, Ezra was shocked

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find that serious sins have taken place

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:54.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the Jews.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:56.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approached Jehovah in public prayer,

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and action was taken

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
to restore the spiritual condition
of the people.

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read the book of Ezra,

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
take note of how Jehovah
fulfilled his promise

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:11.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
to free his people from exile in Babylon

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to restore true worship in Jerusalem

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
—important steps

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading to the appearance of the Messiah.
