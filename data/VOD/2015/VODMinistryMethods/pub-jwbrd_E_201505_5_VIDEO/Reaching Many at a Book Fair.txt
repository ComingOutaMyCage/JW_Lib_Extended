00:00:01 Our objective has always been
00:00:05 to make our literature available
00:00:08 to as many people as possible.
00:00:11 Recently, a secular book fair was arranged
00:00:16 in the city of Guadalajara, in Mexico.
00:00:20 Our brothers thought it would be the perfect opportunity
00:00:24 to help the visitors learn more
00:00:26 about the best book ever written
00:00:29 —the Bible.
00:00:42 Preaching where the people are is crucial,
00:00:44 and here there are thousands!
00:00:46 In a short time we can reach people
00:00:48 that we wouldn’t normally find at home.
00:00:51 A lot of young people visited us here.
00:00:53 I really like how you have it set up with books and brochures.
00:00:59 Teenagers have a lot of questions, but they don’t ask them.
00:01:02 If God is so powerful, why does he let us suffer?
00:01:05 That’s a question that a lot of people ask themselves
00:01:07 since we think of God as the Almighty,
00:01:10 and a lot of times that’s why many people lose their faith.
00:01:14 One of my students is a Jehovah’s Witness.
00:01:16 I once was able to get ahold of a copy of the book Young People Ask,
00:01:19 and I found the information there very interesting, very complete.
00:01:23 It’s really helped me in particular to raise my daughters.
00:01:27 Many people were surprised
00:01:29 to learn that our publications
00:01:30 are distributed completely free of charge.
00:01:33 What caught my attention is your generosity,
00:01:36 offering publications without expecting anything in return.
00:01:40 In fact, one person even seemed a bit annoyed.
00:01:43 He said: “How is it possible
00:01:44 that you don’t charge for this?”
00:01:46 He said: “This is worth a lot.”
00:01:48 We were very surprised by the public’s response.
00:01:51 Around 30,000 publications were distributed.
00:01:56 In fact, just between volumes one and two of the book
00:01:59 Young People Ask—Answers That Work,
00:02:02 some 8,000 copies were placed.
00:02:06 One of the main objectives of our booth
00:02:08 was to draw attention to the content on our jw.org website.
00:02:15 To begin with, what really caught my attention were the videos.
00:02:18 What has really drawn people’s attention
00:02:21 is that they’re being able
00:02:22 to watch the videos for themselves.
00:02:25 That really attracts them.
00:02:27 Kids learn through videos.
00:02:29 So it’s very important for us as humans
00:02:32 to teach our kids values using these different tools.
00:02:38 As parents, our duty is to mold our children
00:02:42 into persons with good principles,
00:02:44 good values.
00:02:45 A teacher watched the whiteboard animation videos,
00:02:49 and that’s what most impressed her.
00:02:51 She said she’s going to use them in her classroom.
00:02:54 From what I saw, to me, the site is very good, very educational.
00:02:58 I think it’s great.
00:03:01 You can help thousands of people
00:03:02 right from the intimacy of their homes, where they’re comfortable,
00:03:06 to consult Bible-based information.
00:03:08 If they had knocked on my door, I probably would have shut it on them.
00:03:12 But I think this method is very different.
00:03:14 To me, it’s a lot more dynamic.
00:03:16 I was one of those persons
00:03:18 who would just take the literature, and I was like, “Just leave it with me.
00:03:21 Maybe I’ll read it later.”
00:03:23 I think that when we get ahold of a tablet or a laptop
00:03:25 and we start opening Web pages,
00:03:28 and especially the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ site,
00:03:30 you start seeing what you need without having to ask questions,
00:03:33 and especially because the pages are so eye-catching.
00:03:36 What’s happening here is really important,
00:03:38 and I think what you people are doing is great.
00:03:41 I was a completely different person before,
00:03:44 but this has helped my family to be more united.
00:04:09 What fine results
00:04:12 will undoubtedly come from this new initiative.
00:04:17 The Central America branch received approval
00:04:20 from the Service Committee of the Governing Body for this event.
00:04:24 Such requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
