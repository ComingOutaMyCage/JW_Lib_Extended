00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:05.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our objective has always been

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make our literature available

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:11.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
to as many people as possible.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:16.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, a secular book fair was arranged

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Guadalajara, in Mexico.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:24.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers thought
it would be the perfect opportunity

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help the visitors learn more

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:29.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the best book ever written

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Bible.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:44.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
Preaching where the people are is crucial,

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:46.596 line:10% position:50% align:center
and here there are thousands!

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:48.698 line:10% position:50% align:center
In a short time we can reach people

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:50.700 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we wouldn’t normally find at home.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of young people visited us here.

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really like how you have it set up
with books and brochures.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teenagers have a lot of questions,
but they don’t ask them.

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
If God is so powerful,
why does he let us suffer?

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a question
that a lot of people ask themselves

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
since we think of God as the Almighty,

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a lot of times that’s why
many people lose their faith.

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:16.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of my students
is a Jehovah’s Witness.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:19.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
I once was able to get ahold
of a copy of the book <i>Young People Ask,</i>

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I found the information there
very interesting, very complete.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really helped me in particular
to raise my daughters.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people were surprised

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:30.874 line:10% position:50% align:center
to learn that our publications

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:32.976 line:10% position:50% align:center
are distributed completely free of charge.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
What caught my attention
is your generosity,

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:39.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
offering publications
without expecting anything in return.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.219 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, one person even seemed a bit annoyed.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.788 line:10% position:50% align:center
He said: “How is it possible

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
that you don’t charge for this?”

00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:48.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “This is worth a lot.”

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very surprised
by the public’s response.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around 30,000 publications
were distributed.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, just between
volumes one and two of the book

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Young People Ask—Answers That Work,</i>

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:04.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 8,000 copies were placed.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the main objectives of our booth

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:13.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to draw attention
to the content on our jw.org website.

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin with, what really
caught my attention were the videos.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has really drawn people’s attention

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:22.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
is that they’re being able

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
to watch the videos for themselves.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really attracts them.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kids learn through videos.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s very important for us as humans

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach our kids values
using these different tools.

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
As parents,
our duty is to mold our children

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:44.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
into persons with good principles,

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:45.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
good values.

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
A teacher watched
the whiteboard animation videos,

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s what most impressed her.

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said she’s going to use them
in her classroom.

00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:58.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
From what I saw, to me,
the site is very good, very educational.

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:00.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s great.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:02.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can help thousands of people

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
right from the intimacy of their homes,
where they’re comfortable,

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:08.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consult Bible-based information.

00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:12.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they had knocked on my door,
I probably would have shut it on them.

00:03:12.742 --> 00:03:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I think this method is very different.

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
To me, it’s a lot more dynamic.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was one of those persons

00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:21.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would just take the literature,
and I was like, “Just leave it with me.

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:23.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I’ll read it later.”

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that when we
get ahold of a tablet or a laptop

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we start opening Web pages,

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially
the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ site,

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
you start seeing what you need
without having to ask questions,

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially
because the pages are so eye-catching.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:38.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s happening here
is really important,

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:41.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think
what you people are doing is great.

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a completely different person before,

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this has helped my family
to be more united.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
What fine results

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:17.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
will undoubtedly come
from this new initiative.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Central America branch
received approval

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:24.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Service Committee
of the Governing Body for this event.

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such requests
are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
