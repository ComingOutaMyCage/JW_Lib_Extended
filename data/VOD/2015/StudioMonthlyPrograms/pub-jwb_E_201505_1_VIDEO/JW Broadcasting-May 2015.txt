00:00:02 We warmly welcome you to another edition of JW Broadcasting.
00:00:11 And this broadcast is historic.
00:00:14 In what ways?
00:00:16 Well, think about this.
00:00:18 The first broadcast on this station was in October of 2014.
00:00:25 It is hard to believe.
00:00:27 But seven months have already flown by.
00:00:31 That means that each member of the governing body has had the opportunity to host one of our monthly programs, and we are now starting over again.
00:00:45 But what is truly historic about this month program?
00:00:49 Is that the governing body has approved JW Broadcasting to be broadcast?
00:00:55 Now listen to this.
00:00:57 In over 40 different languages.
00:01:02 While these are not all available at this time.
00:01:06 Many additional languages are ready for viewing this month.
00:01:12 The list of languages can be found on the tv.jw.org home page.
00:01:19 By clicking on the language symbol at the top right hand corner of the screen.
00:01:27 That takes you to the page with the various languages that can be selected.
00:01:35 This month we will find out what Bible principle can help us make a sound decision when forced to choose between our secular job.
00:01:48 And theocratic activities.
00:01:54 To what lengths does Jehovah's Organization go to reach the blind with the good news?
00:02:02 This documentary will assure us of Jehovah's Law for everyone, no matter what our circumstances in life might be.
00:02:13 And we have a music video about giving our time and resources to Jehovah.
00:02:22 Yes, this is the main program of JW Broadcasting.
00:02:52 The governing body.
00:02:54 Has asked me to use Proverbs 39 as the theme for the message they would like to be shared with the entire household of faith this month.
00:03:08 Let's read that text together.
00:03:10 Proverbs chapter 3 verse nine, and after we read it.
00:03:16 We want to consider what are your valuable things and what does the verse mean by giving the first fruits.
00:03:25 Let's read proverbs chapter 3 verse 9.
00:03:32 Honor Jehovah.
00:03:34 With your valuable things.
00:03:37 With the first fruits of all your produce.
00:03:42 Let's let's first talk a little bit about what it means to offer our first fruits.
00:03:50 In Bible times.
00:03:52 It meant the earliest fruits of a season.
00:03:56 So way before an Israelite knew what kind of a harvest he would have.
00:04:01 Whether it would be a bumper crop?
00:04:04 Are very meager returns with full faith and confidence.
00:04:09 He was to give the first fruits to Jehovah.
00:04:13 Not just leftovers at the end of the harvest season.
00:04:19 The Hebrew word for first fruit.
00:04:23 Is in the sense of being the best of that early season.
00:04:28 So the idea conveyed is not only first chronologically.
00:04:32 But also first in Kuala.
00:04:35 In fact, Exodus 2319 says this.
00:04:42 It says you are to bring.
00:04:45 The best of the first ripe fruits of your ground to the House of Jehovah your God.
00:04:54 The best of the first fruits would truly honor Jehovah.
00:05:00 And the Greek term for first fruits comes from a root word having the basic meaning of primacy or preeminence.
00:05:12 Again, the idea the best we have.
00:05:18 Proverbs 39 also indicated that we can honor our show respect and appreciation for Jehovah.
00:05:27 With our valuable things.
00:05:30 And as stated, it Revelation 411.
00:05:34 Jehovah is truly worthy of all the honor we can give him.
00:05:40 Not only do we owe it to him because he is our creator.
00:05:44 He is worthy event because of the kind of God he is.
00:05:49 But what are the valuable things with which we can honor Jehovah?
00:05:56 What first might come to mind or our material possessions?
00:06:02 Our finances.
00:06:04 Well, that is true and we want to talk about this a little bit later.
00:06:09 But there are many other valuables that a Christian can offer to Jehovah to give him the honor that he is worthy of.
00:06:19 For example, our time.
00:06:22 Mr Benjamin Franklin, a scientist and statesman, once said, do not squander time.
00:06:30 For that, as the stuff life is made of.
00:06:35 Yes, time is a valuable resource.
00:06:39 And many of you dear ones are offering your valuable time in the ministry each month.
00:06:46 Some of you are able to give to Jehovah 70 or more hours a month in the ministry as regular pioneers.
00:06:57 While others of us are not in a position to spend that amount of time in the field ministry.
00:07:03 We rejoice with those who can.
00:07:06 And interestingly.
00:07:08 Under the law given to Moses.
00:07:11 The quantity of first fruits to be offered was not fixed.
00:07:16 It was left to the generosity and circumstances.
00:07:21 Of the giver.
00:07:22 He was to give his best though.
00:07:25 No matter how much or how little that proved to be.
00:07:31 No matter what the amount then.
00:07:34 Can we give the first fruits of our time in the ministry?
00:07:39 We do this by scheduling some time early in the.
00:07:44 Not just leftovers, the last few days of the month.
00:07:49 Remember, we give Jehovah our first fruits.
00:07:55 What other valuable things do we possess?
00:07:59 That we can give to Jehovah.
00:08:01 Thus honoring him.
00:08:04 Well, many have construction skill.
00:08:07 And other talents that they are willing to offer for the building of Kingdom halls. Assembly halls, remote translation offices and branch facilities, including the large World Headquarters complex in Warwick, NY.
00:08:26 Jehovah is magnified by such voluntary contributions of energy and skills.
00:08:35 These are truly valuable things.
00:08:42 But now I would like to address the valuable things that may have first come to mind.
00:08:48 Material possessions.
00:08:51 Or financial giving and support.
00:08:55 As you know, for over 130 years.
00:08:59 This organization has never solicited for.
00:09:03 And it is certainly not going to start now.
00:09:07 We don't send out monthly statements to each of Jehovah's Witnesses specifying a dollar amount that should be submitted to finance the work worldwide.
00:09:19 Most donations, in fact, are contributed anonymously.
00:09:25 Over the years I have told various Bible students that a person could attend our meetings for 20 years.
00:09:33 And never put a penny in the contribution box.
00:09:37 And we would not know it.
00:09:39 Jehovah, of course, would know it.
00:09:41 But we would not, because the donations are anonymous.
00:09:46 But from the heart.
00:09:48 We don't know who gives what.
00:09:53 But for a certainty.
00:09:55 Any donations received do not line anyone's pockets.
00:10:01 And are not misappropriated.
00:10:04 They are all used in supporting theocratic endeavors worldwide.
00:10:10 As described in Matthew 24 or 45 through 47.
00:10:15 The governing body prayerfully and sincerely endeavors.
00:10:19 To be not only the faithful slave.
00:10:23 But also the discreet slave in wisely managing the Masters resources.
00:10:31 And please, dear brothers and sisters, pray for Jehovah to help us to be successful in being not only faithful, but also discreet.
00:10:43 But often a member of the governing body will be hard to say.
00:10:48 In spending Jehovah's money.
00:10:50 We have to be more careful than we are in spinning our own money.
00:10:58 And that is truly how we feel about the matter.
00:11:02 Yet as you can well imagine, millions of dollars are required each month to finance the colossal Kingdom work.
00:11:12 That is being supported by this organization in some 239 lands.
00:11:21 Where does all of the financial support come from?
00:11:25 Largely from you, dear brothers and sisters.
00:11:30 Most funds come.
00:11:32 From what you voluntarily put in the contribution box.
00:11:37 In your Kingdom hall.
00:11:39 Yes, that little box with a slot.
00:11:43 That is labeled worldwide work.
00:11:46 Is primarily what finances all of the theocratic initiatives that have been implemented.
00:11:56 Of course there are many other ways to contribute, as explained, usually in the November issue of the Watchtower each year.
00:12:07 Sometimes we may feel a little shy to talk about the financial needs of the organization.
00:12:15 That is understandable.
00:12:17 Because we in no way want to be categorized with other organizations, religious and otherwise.
00:12:25 That coerce their supporters.
00:12:29 To donate
00:12:33 Because all of us have the.
00:12:34 Privilege to donate funds.
00:12:37 We would like to let you know something about our current situation.
00:12:42 Then you can respond as your heart impels you.
00:12:49 As you might have sensed.
00:12:52 I am not shy about this subject.
00:12:55 And why not?
00:12:57 It is because we have many scriptural examples of Jehovah's Faithful servants making known the financial needs of the congregation.
00:13:09 Only when supporters of the Kingdom know the needs.
00:13:13 Can they respond accordingly?
00:13:16 For example, turn with me please to Exodus Chapter 35.
00:13:23 Now think about this as you're turning there.
00:13:26 The Israelites were in Sinai.
00:13:30 They were marching through.
00:13:32 Uh, wilderness.
00:13:35 They do not have fields or businesses with money flowing in, they just had what they had brought with them when leaving Egypt.
00:13:44 Nevertheless, Jehovah instructed them to build a place of worship.
00:13:51 Was Jehovah shy?
00:13:53 About letting the people know about the material needs.
00:13:57 Well, read with me Exodus 35 versus 4 and 5.
00:14:05 Moses then said to the entire assembly of the Israelites.
00:14:11 This is what Jehovah has commanded that wouldn't Moses command.
00:14:17 This is what Jehovah has commanded.
00:14:21 Take up a contribution.
00:14:24 For jehovah.
00:14:26 From among yourselves.
00:14:29 Let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution.
00:14:34 For jehovah.
00:14:36 Gold, silver, copper.
00:14:41 You see, the people would not have known this need.
00:14:45 If Jehovah had not informed them.
00:14:49 Very interesting, is it not.
00:14:53 The governing body very much feels the urgency.
00:14:56 Of accomplishing as much as we possibly can in behalf of Kingdom interest, knowing that the great day of Jehovah is near.
00:15:07 So in an effort to keep you informed of the support that is needed for this great work.
00:15:14 I have the following information to share.
00:15:20 We have looked forward.
00:15:22 To this next fiscal year.
00:15:25 And projected the expenditures for all of the theocratic initiatives we are scheduling.
00:15:32 In doing the math.
00:15:34 We found that the amount of money flowing out.
00:15:38 Will be much greater than the amount of money that we have coming in at this time.
00:15:45 Well, why is that?
00:15:47 Does this represent a lack of appreciation for spiritual things?
00:15:54 Absolutely not.
00:15:56 To the contrary.
00:15:58 We are witnessing unprecedented enthusiasm among the brotherhood for all the spiritual bounty that is coming our way.
00:16:09 We have up-to-date Bibles and an abundance of printed literature.
00:16:15 And there's so much appreciation for the new and continually improvingjw.org website.
00:16:25 From around the world.
00:16:27 We receive letters thanking the governing body for JW Broadcasting.
00:16:33 Many comment that it has brought us closer together as a people.
00:16:38 And as mentioned starting this month, JW Broadcasting is available in multiple languages.
00:16:47 We are thrilled about this development.
00:16:51 There is also excitement about public witnessing using literature carts.
00:16:57 And with such great success, no.
00:17:01 The financial circumstance has nothing to do with the lack of spirituality or appreciation.
00:17:11 There are some facts.
00:17:13 That we want to make you aware of.
00:17:18 For one thing, the financial needs in the field.
00:17:23 Have accelerated
00:17:26 At a pace unlike any time in the recent past.
00:17:31 A recent analysis of the need for Kingdom halls here in the United States showed that some 1600 new Kingdom halls.
00:17:41 Or major renovations are needed.
00:17:45 Not sometime in the future, but right now.
00:17:50 And worldwide we are in need of more than 14,000 places of worship.
00:17:59 Not including ongoing future growth.
00:18:04 In the past 15 years, 30,000 Kingdom halls have been built.
00:18:10 Now, if you figure that up, that average is about 2000 Kingdom halls every year.
00:18:15 But in an effort to relieve the serious backlog more quickly.
00:18:21 We intend Jehovah willing to complete 3000 Kingdom Hall projects every year going forward.
00:18:30 Now that's a 50% increase.
00:18:33 Additionally, adjustments are being made to simplify the Kingdom hall design in order to accelerate the construction schedule.
00:18:43 And to save funds.
00:18:45 Though the design will be simplified.
00:18:49 The sheer number of Kingdom halls requires considerably more funds in the budget.
00:18:56 That in times past.
00:18:58 Additionally, please think about this.
00:19:04 How many publishing companies print publications in the many languages that Jehovah's Organization does?
00:19:12 The answer.
00:19:15 And why is that?
00:19:17 Is because they cannot make a financial profit.
00:19:22 We, however, are accelerating our method of translating publications into indigenous languages.
00:19:32 This involves building or purchasing regional translation offices or rose.
00:19:41 These will be strategically located in a part of a country.
00:19:46 With the highest concentration of native speakers of the language.
00:19:51 Providing these structures in various regions of a country reduces the need for costly construction expansion at the local branch office.
00:20:02 But in the next.
00:20:03 Two years, however, upwards now think about this.
00:20:08 170 of such facilities.
00:20:13 Autos are needed.
00:20:17 Depending on the country and the cost of materials, and to can cost for about $1,000,000.
00:20:27 To several $1,000,000 each.
00:20:30 Hence we have another reason we need to increase our finances.
00:20:36 We just felt that.
00:20:39 You, dear brothers and sisters, needed to be made aware of these expenditures.
00:20:45 That we're facing in the coming months and years.
00:20:53 We also have heard from circuit overseers and others that some of the brothers and sisters.
00:20:59 May have a misconception about some of the recent policy changes.
00:21:05 That have been instituted.
00:21:08 For example.
00:21:10 All congregations that had a Kingdom hall or assembly hall loan to pay off.
00:21:16 Were informed.
00:21:17 That their mortgages were cancelled.
00:21:21 Now, if you think about that is amazing, isn't all their loans were cancelled?
00:21:26 Can you imagine a bank telling homeowners that all their loans were cancelled?
00:21:33 And that they should merely send into the bank each month, whatever they can afford.
00:21:39 Only in Jehovah's organization.
00:21:42 Could such a thing happen?
00:21:45 However, according to some of our circuit overseers, some of us took this domain that the organization had a surplus of funds and thus took this action.
00:21:57 As if the loans did not need to be reimbursed.
00:22:02 Could this misconception have affected the amount that some have chosen to donate each month?
00:22:11 In actuality
00:22:13 The mortgages were cancelled so as not to be a hardship on some congregations and circuits.
00:22:20 The policy was founded on the scriptural principle stated in Second Corinthians Chapter 8.
00:22:27 Please turn there with me.
00:22:30 In an effort to help fellow Christians who were facing financial hardship in the 1st century.
00:22:38 An arrangement had been put in place.
00:22:41 To accept contributions from others to help offset the deficiency.
00:22:49 About a year later, Paul is again writing to the Corinthians about this policy of contributing to offset the financial needs of others.
00:23:00 Now, please read with me second Corinthians Chapter 8.
00:23:05 And we're going to read verses Tim through 15.
00:23:08 Here the apostle Paul.
00:23:11 Under inspiration.
00:23:13 Said this
00:23:15 Verse 10.
00:23:17 And in this I give my opinion.
00:23:22 This is for your benefit, seeing that already a year ago.
00:23:27 You not only initiated the action that is of contributing.
00:23:32 But also showed your desire to do it.
00:23:35 So now also complete what you started to do.
00:23:40 So that your readiness to act.
00:23:42 Or contribute.
00:23:44 May be completed according to now notice.
00:23:48 The means you have available.
00:23:52 For if the readiness is there first.
00:23:55 It is especially acceptable according to what a person has.
00:24:00 Not according to what a person does not have.
00:24:04 For I do not want to make.
00:24:05 It easy for others.
00:24:07 But difficult for you.
00:24:09 But that by means of.
00:24:12 And equalizing.
00:24:15 Your surplus at the present time by offset their need.
00:24:21 So that their surplus might also offset your deficiency.
00:24:27 That there may be an equalizing.
00:24:31 Just as it is written.
00:24:34 The person with much.
00:24:36 Did not have too much.
00:24:38 And the person with little did not have two littles.
00:24:43 So that was the scriptural basis for canceling all loan repayments.
00:24:50 It was not because the organization had a large surplus of funds and thus could quote afford to cancel these mortgages.
00:25:00 As explained at the time, it was to equalize the reimbursement of such expenditures over the entire brotherhood.
00:25:09 Some businessmen in the secular world might think.
00:25:14 This was a disastrous policy change.
00:25:20 We know the spirit of Jehovah's faithful servants.
00:25:23 We all feel privileged to be able to help the growing brotherhood to have comfortable places to meet.
00:25:31 And praise Jehovah.
00:25:34 Think about this comparison.
00:25:36 Back in 1990.
00:25:39 When the decision was made to distribute our literature free of charge.
00:25:44 Some within the organization.
00:25:47 And many outside the organization.
00:25:50 Thought this would be financial suicide.
00:25:56 You, dear brothers and sisters, have proved those predictions completely wrong.
00:26:03 Jesus said at Matthew 1119 all the same.
00:26:08 Wisdom is proved righteous by its works.
00:26:12 Our individual voluntary donations have combined to take care of the costs associated with producing our literature.
00:26:21 And we're confident that the same will prove true regarding the decision to cancel all Kingdom Hall and assembly Hall loans.
00:26:32 So instead of conveying the message.
00:26:35 That the organization needed less in the way of donations.
00:26:40 The intent was really just the opposite.
00:26:44 But we have confidence that our hearts will be moved to contribute what we can each month.
00:26:51 To offset the necessary expense of building new meeting places for our brothers worldwide.
00:27:02 Another misimpression that has been brought to our attention.
00:27:06 Is that the sale of property in New York City?
00:27:10 Means that fewer donations are needed.
00:27:14 To help put things in proper perspective however.
00:27:17 Selling one of the significant properties in New York.
00:27:22 Really only covered the operating expenses for the worldwide work.
00:27:27 For a few weeks.
00:27:29 Now that's one significant property.
00:27:33 And in actuality, the sail of property in New York City.
00:27:38 Is basically only financing the construction of world headquarters in Warwick.
00:27:45 And the purchase of other properties that are needed to facilitate the move from Brooklyn in the future.
00:27:53 But on top of that has mentioned.
00:27:56 We are planning on accelerating the building of Kingdom halls and remote translation offices in coming years.
00:28:06 It is our desire.
00:28:08 Jehovah willing
00:28:10 To hold to the accelerated schedule for these projects.
00:28:15 If at all possible.
00:28:17 Rather than having to scale back such progress because of a lack of available funds.
00:28:29 We are not in any way desirous of creating a hardship on anyone.
00:28:34 However, we felt that if you knew the circumstances accurately.
00:28:39 You would apply.
00:28:41 Proverbs 327 to the situation.
00:28:45 There we are encouraged not.
00:28:48 To withhold what is good.
00:28:51 But then the scripture ads if.
00:28:54 It is within our power to help.
00:28:59 And I might mention that this is true even of publishers in less affluent countries.
00:29:07 It is encouraging to note.
00:29:10 That even in lands with limited resources.
00:29:13 The very poor contribute to the cost of their Kingdom hall and its maintenance.
00:29:20 We're all Jehovah's United people.
00:29:23 Even if we do not have much materially.
00:29:26 If our heart is willing.
00:29:29 There is usually something.
00:29:31 We can do, even if it is merely offering two small coins of very little value.
00:29:39 As the poor widow did.
00:29:42 And how did Jesus feel about her for doing this?
00:29:46 He highly praised her in Mark 1242 through 44.
00:29:54 And if we think about it, a small donation.
00:29:58 From each of many of Jehovah's People adds up to a large amount of dedicated funds.
00:30:05 That can be used powerfully by Jehovah's Organization.
00:30:11 Please turn back to Exodus Chapter 35.
00:30:16 As mentioned, Jehovah was not shy about informing his people of the financial needs for true worship.
00:30:25 But once the need was known.
00:30:28 What was the initial result?
00:30:31 Exodus 35 and let's read verse 21.
00:30:36 And the first part of verse 22.
00:30:40 Then everyone whose heart impaled him.
00:30:44 And everyone who's spirit incited him.
00:30:48 Came and brought their contribution for Jehovah.
00:30:54 To be used for the tent of meeting.
00:30:57 For all his service.
00:30:59 And for the holy garments.
00:31:01 They kept coming.
00:31:03 The men, along with the women, each with a willing heart.
00:31:10 And what were the final results? Well, look at Exodus Chapter 36 and we're going to read verse 7.
00:31:18 Let's see, did Jehovah have to scale back on the amount of work because of a lack of material support?
00:31:25 Verse 7.
00:31:27 The goods were enough.
00:31:29 For all the work to be done.
00:31:33 And more than enough.
00:31:36 Yes, when the hearts of Jehovah's people are motivated.
00:31:40 Wonderful things happen.
00:31:44 The governing body wanted to make you aware of the financial needs in the world field.
00:31:52 And we are confident that with this knowledge.
00:31:56 You're appreciative, hearts will move you to do what you can to support the work at hand.
00:32:05 Yes, we can honor Jehovah with our valuable things, including the financial support of true worship.
00:32:18 But as we mentioned at the outset.
00:32:21 Are valuable things include much more.
00:32:24 For example.
00:32:25 Our time as we talked about spinning the ministry.
00:32:29 May we all give our individual first fruits the best we can do with our present circumstances?
00:32:39 Some are honoring Jehovah by moving to places where the need for Kingdom preachers is greater.
00:32:46 That's commendable.
00:32:48 We spoke of giving our skills and energy to theocratic construction projects.
00:32:55 We appreciate all of you who have honored Jehovah in this way in the past, tirelessly working with regional building committees and in the lands with limited resources program.
00:33:08 And we thank all of you who will continue.
00:33:13 To support the construction of buildings that will bring praise to Jehovah.
00:33:20 What other valuable things bring honor to Jehovah?
00:33:24 Many thousands are learning new languages.
00:33:27 To be able to help spread the good news to yet more deserving wines.
00:33:34 It may well be.
00:33:35 Now think about this.
00:33:37 That this organization has the most multilingual speakers of any organization on Earth.
00:33:45 That's amazing, isn't.
00:33:47 Still others honor Jehovah by expanding themselves on hospital liaison committees.
00:33:55 And patient visitation groups.
00:33:58 Though you do so often behind the scenes with no limelight.
00:34:04 Be assured that those you help know what you do.
00:34:10 And the sovereign of the universe sees you.
00:34:14 And received your gift honorably.
00:34:17 It is just as is stated at HEB 610.
00:34:21 Jehovah does not forget your work.
00:34:24 And the love you showed for his name by ministering.
00:34:30 And continuing to Minister to the Holy Ones.
00:34:35 There are also circuit overseers in Bethel.
00:34:37 Family members around the earth.
00:34:40 Who give their best to Jehovah Daily?
00:34:44 Some of you are fateful caregivers of sick or elderly servants of Jehovah.
00:34:51 There is a where factor.
00:34:54 That is hard to quantify.
00:34:56 But no.
00:34:58 That your God accepts such a gift of love with full knowledge of what you have done.
00:35:07 Well, at this point.
00:35:08 I will borrow the words of Paul as he enumerated in Hebrews Chapter 11.
00:35:15 Many men and women of faith.
00:35:18 But then said as recorded in verse 32.
00:35:22 And what more will I say?
00:35:25 For time will fail me if I go on to relate about and then he listed others.
00:35:31 Who had honored Jehovah with their valuable things.
00:35:35 Similarly, time would fail us.
00:35:38 If we tried to enumerate all of you dear ones, and all of them many ways that you are honoring Jehovah with your valuable things.
00:35:50 But may Jehovah continue to bless each and everyone of you who are doing so.
00:36:01 We have now touched on some of the ways that we can bring praise to Jehovah.
00:36:07 And support our dear brothers and sisters worldwide.
00:36:11 In a few minutes.
00:36:13 We will see some real life examples that highlight the results of our giving spirit.
00:36:20 But first.
00:36:22 We would like to share with you a summary of how the organization uses our donations.
00:36:37 In ancient times, when an Israelite made a heartfelt offering to support the temple, that offering was referred to as a gift in hand to Jehovah.
00:36:52 Today in Kingdom halls of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world, there are small boxes marked for voluntary contributions.
00:37:01 When we give our valuable things, where does it actually go?
00:37:06 Each year hundreds of thousands become our new brothers and sisters.
00:37:11 To accommodate our growing numbers, funds are provided to help construct new places of worship as well as branch facilities all over the world.
00:37:21 One thing that I really appreciate about being here is to see family.
00:37:25 Heads, fathers and husbands choose to use their vacation time.
00:37:31 So thank you to the families and congregations that support all of this and us to be here.
00:37:38 But it's just as impressive as seeing millions of brothers and sisters voluntarily given their funds so that we can keep building just that in itself is an amazing act of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.
00:37:52 Large doors leading to greater activity are being opened by means of theocratic schools.
00:37:59 Training is provided to help those enrolled to develop spiritually and take a zealous lead in the evangelizing work.
00:38:06 When you think of the organization and the education, the divine education that it provides, there is no government on Earth today that educates his citizens like the Kingdom.
00:38:21 It has strengthened my relationship with Jehovah in ways I never considered before.
00:38:27 The training is wonderful and motivates spiritual growth.
00:38:32 Voluntary contributions helped support the thousands of special full time servants worldwide.
00:38:39 These include bethelites.
00:38:40 While working in the primary, it's abundantly clear that none of this have happened without Jehovah support, shown by what the French teen gives.
00:38:50 I love my assignment.
00:38:51 And serve with the knowledge that my sacrifice wouldn't be possible without the sacrifice of brothers and sisters.
00:38:57 In the field.
00:38:59 Also included are missionaries, traveling, overseers, international servants, and special pioneers.
00:39:10 All that support makes it possible and makes our assignment a great joy and a privilege, something that we look forward to each and every week, each and every month, each and every year that we're able to devote our full time efforts in preaching.
00:39:23 The good news of.
00:39:24 The Kingdom it allows us to be here so that we can help as many people.
00:39:28 As possible, we do want to learn about you.
00:39:32 Every year we look forward to receiving rich spiritual gems at our conventions.
00:39:38 Funds are provided for equipment and other needs to help everything run as smoothly as possible.
00:39:46 It was a delight this year to see how technology was used to promote the unity.
00:39:51 Having the different cities involved were video streaming to them for the key talks by governing body members and their helpers received tremendous response from those cities.
00:40:01 We seen more people in their seats during the program because they were afraid to get up even for a moment.
00:40:06 'cause they might miss something that was special.
00:40:10 When disaster strikes, your donations help give immediate relief for our brothers and sisters in need.
00:40:18 Clothing, building materials and much more are shipped over as quickly as possible.
00:40:25 I have come to really appreciate Jehovah's Organization.
00:40:29 No other organization can compare and how it provides support in such a loving way.
00:40:36 I know now.
00:40:37 You know, like Jehovah's look, after his people.
00:40:40 I'm really grateful for that, and I'd be praying and giving thanks.
00:40:45 Yes, all our contributions have a meaningful share in supporting Kingdom interests worldwide.
00:40:52 Each donation is like a gift in hand to our Heavenly Father Jehovah.
00:40:58 When we give from our heart, we are expressing our love for him and that is the best gift we can give him.
00:41:10 Our organization is truly multifaceted.
00:41:16 The Brotherhood is constantly giving of themselves literally day and night.
00:41:23 When we consider the global effort that is involved.
00:41:28 At times, though, some family heads face a dilemma that involves making a decision about how they will support their family without putting themselves in spiritual jeopardy.
00:41:44 You're about to meet a brother who was in a quandary as to what to do.
00:41:51 What Bible principle helped him to continue to put Kingdom interests first?
00:41:58 Let's find out.
00:42:06 I've always enjoyed my work and even the people I worked with.
00:42:29 It's hard to balance work in meetings.
00:42:32 But since I was baptized, I've always done my best to be there.
00:42:42 My wife is a great support.
00:42:47 And we work hard to teach our children.
00:42:50 They've been my greatest joy.
00:42:53 I want to make sure that they're cared for.
00:42:57 I believed that if I worked hard enough.
00:43:01 I'd always be able to provide for my family.
00:43:06 But my boss wanted more than I was willing to give.
00:43:12 Cystid that I work Sundays during my meeting.
00:43:20 I needed this job.
00:43:23 My wife and I were worried.
00:43:26 What would happen if I lost it?
00:43:31 I was determined to take a stand for my meetings.
00:43:36 I spoke to my boss and explained my decision.
00:43:40 But he refused to compromise.
00:43:48 I was shocked.
00:43:52 I didn't think this was how it was supposed to go.
00:43:58 How would I support my family?
00:44:03 Paul studied the Bible with me.
00:44:06 We've been close ever since.
00:44:09 He invited me out.
00:44:11 And I guess he'd heard about what happened.
00:44:18 He really listened as I poured out my concerns.
00:44:23 I wondered if I should have just done what my boss insisted I would have missed my meeting, but I still could have attended an evening meeting at a different congregation.
00:44:38 My skills were limited and there just weren't that many jobs out there for me.
00:44:45 I told him I was seriously considering a job that would involve a lot of travel.
00:44:55 Paul read to me from Matthew Chapter 6 verses 25 to 33.
00:45:01 Stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what you will wear.
00:45:10 Keep on then seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness and all these other things will be.
00:45:18 Added to you.
00:45:20 He reminded me that as a newly baptized witness, my prayers are much more readily received and Jehovah was ready to respond.
00:45:31 He encouraged me to include Jehovah in my decision.
00:45:38 Patience is not easy for me, but I decided to look to Jehovah to provide the right job.
00:45:49 So every day I kept looking.
00:45:57 But work never came.
00:46:18 I never thought that it would go on so long.
00:46:25 Eventually I had to go on unemployment insurance so we could get by.
00:46:31 I knew that I was doing the right thing, but.
00:46:36 I couldn't help feeling that I was letting my family down.
00:46:47 One night I was reminded of Jesus words in Matthew Chapter 6.
00:46:57 Observe intently the birds of heaven.
00:47:01 They do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
00:47:09 Are you not worth more than they are?
00:47:15 I realized that I was still relying on myself and not fully throwing my anxiety on Jehovah.
00:47:25 My skills may be limited, but Jehovah or not.
00:47:29 So I kept on looking, but I used my extra time to auxiliary pioneer.
00:47:37 It was just what I needed.
00:47:39 Eventually, Jehovah opened the door and blessed my patience with a job that was nearby with good hours for my meetings.
00:47:48 I even had more time for the ministry with my family.
00:47:52 It was not an easy experience, but my faith in Jehovah was stronger than ever.
00:47:59 I saw him act in my behalf and I know that he really does care for me.
00:48:07 And my family.
00:48:14 Did you notice how the brother honored Jehovah with his valuable things?
00:48:21 For one
00:48:22 He sacrificed his job so as not to interfere with spiritual activities.
00:48:29 And second, although he was unemployed.
00:48:33 He took the opportunity to auxiliary pioneer.
00:48:37 He was balanced keeping his spiritual focus while diligently seeking other employment.
00:48:45 Jehovah made sure that the brother and his family had what they needed.
00:48:50 And in time he was blessed with another job.
00:48:57 Let's now look at some of the specific examples of how our donations are put to good use.
00:49:06 When the preaching work prospers, the need increases for branch facilities to organize the work and to translate and print our literature.
00:49:17 Recently one such project started in Cameroon, a country in central Africa.
00:49:26 After approval for construction was given.
00:49:30 This video was shown in all congregations in that country.
00:49:37 By preaching from house to house, the public witnessing effort, our campaigns in local languages, and in other aspects of the ministry, each of you has done good work.
00:49:40 Perfect.
00:49:51 Well done.
00:49:54 Here at Bethel.
00:49:55 We are happy to work shoulder to shoulder with you during this period of rapid increase.
00:50:01 On Yolanda Italy.
00:50:05 The governing body is very interested in the progress of the work in our territory.
00:50:11 Because of this.
00:50:13 We would like to share with you a historic announcement that was made to the Bethel family just a few days ago.
00:50:24 We are happy to inform you.
00:50:27 That the governing body has approved.
00:50:31 The construction of a new Bethel.
00:50:45 The world headquarters is already working very hard for the success of this important project.
00:50:52 But what can you do to support this work?
00:50:57 First, the most important thing is to pray everyday for the success of this project that Jehovah directs.
00:51:06 The choice of the location and that he blesses all of the work that will be accomplished.
00:51:13 Second, you can give financial support by your voluntary contributions to the worldwide work.
00:51:21 Oh, I see.
00:51:22 3rd, the building of a new battle is a huge undertaking.
00:51:27 We will need many volunteers to help with the construction project.
00:51:31 If you are able, please ask your elders for a construction volunteer application form.
00:51:39 We are living at a unique time in the history of the preaching work in our branch territory.
00:51:44 The post
00:51:45 We would like to thank you in advance for your prayers, your contributions and your volunteer spirit during the exciting months ahead.
00:51:59 Obviously excitement runs high in the country of Cameroon.
00:52:07 But think about it.
00:52:08 Cameroon is just one of some 90 branches worldwide.
00:52:14 All of such facilities need to be well maintained.
00:52:19 And at times they need to be renovated.
00:52:22 If you would like to see the plans for another branch construction project.
00:52:27 Go to the video on Demand section of JW broadcast.
00:52:33 There you will find an interesting report on plans for the France Bethel facilities.
00:52:41 That construction project will benefit the brothers and sisters in the many countries that the France branch overseas.
00:52:53 Although many of our construction projects are the result of growth in our branch territory.
00:53:00 Our donations also are put to good use when disaster struck.
00:53:07 The organization is quick to respond to the needs of our brothers and sisters in affected areas.
00:53:14 This includes the distribution of relief supplies.
00:53:19 It also involves helping our brothers repair or rebuild their homes and Kingdom halls.
00:53:27 This was the case in 2011 when a large tornado ripped through the state of Missouri in the United States.
00:53:39 When a disaster strikes, the disaster relief dust takes the lead and caring for the needs of the field.
00:53:45 This is done by using volunteers and our brothers know how to work together.
00:53:50 We're using volunteers are used to crawling over each other and working in a Kingdom hall so they have the ability to get into a disaster situation and take direction.
00:53:59 And just take care of.
00:54:00 It evaluation process to see what's new.
00:54:04 Did then purchasing department locally will then go ahead and start buying materials.
00:54:09 Those will be delivered and volunteers will come to to prepare the home back to livable conditions so that our brothers and sisters can get back into their homes.
00:54:18 So we stabilize the friends we stabilize the houses. We can stabilize the congregation. We had a group of brothers that went into Joplin MO after the tornado destroyed 30% of the city. We had probably 30-40 volunteers working on the House.
00:54:32 And a woman gums down the street from the neighborhood.
00:54:36 She sees all.
00:54:36 The volunteers working.
00:54:38 She thinks it's a construction organization, she says can I pay you to come over and fix my garage?
00:54:43 It was basically a shed that had been picked up off the slab and turned upside down and moved a few feet away from this lab.
00:54:50 So the brother said, well, let's go take a look.
00:54:52 Got it so they went over, then took a look at it.
00:54:55 It wasn't that hard that the shed was still intact.
00:54:58 They said we could do this in a few minutes so they went and got all their volunteers.
00:55:01 They went over there.
00:55:02 They picked the shed up.
00:55:03 They got about 30 brothers on it and they turned it over and put it on the.
00:55:07 And the woman was so thankful.
00:55:09 She says, OK, So what do I owe you?
00:55:11 They said, no, we're all volunteers were Jehovah's Witnesses were working through the local Kingdom hall here.
00:55:15 Release center.
00:55:17 And she says, you're kidding me, you're all volunteers, she says.
00:55:20 Yeah, and we're out.
00:55:21 She's what are you doing here?
00:55:22 So we're out working on are our brothers and sisters homes and trying to help.
00:55:27 Get stabilized she was in tears.
00:55:29 She came back down the street a few minutes later with a lot of money in her hand.
00:55:34 She said I want to tell you a story.
00:55:35 She is I called my church after this happened and I asked him to come work do this work for me to put this shed back on its lab.
00:55:45 They said we can do that.
00:55:46 We'll be there in about 3 weeks and it's going to cost you this much.
00:55:51 She says in here you folks come over to my house.
00:55:53 You don't charge me.
00:55:55 You don't even know who I am.
00:55:57 And you put my home back together.
00:55:59 What I needed have done says, here's the money you have this you put in your contribution box.
00:56:04 When someone helps in building a Kingdom hall.
00:56:07 When someone helps in building in assembly, all when someone aids and caring for a natural disaster, their lives.
00:56:16 Changed forever.
00:56:18 When someone is benefited by one of these programs, their lives are changed forever.
00:56:28 The love demonstrated in the organization is truly faith strengthening to see.
00:56:36 The same arrangement to respond to disasters is in place all around the world.
00:56:43 It is your contributions that make this possible.
00:56:47 For this, we sincerely thank you.
00:56:52 But as stated earlier, we provide help in many other ways by means of our voluntary donations.
00:57:01 The primary focus though, is helping people spiritually.
00:57:05 In contrast to Jehovah's Organization.
00:57:08 Many publishing companies do not provide literature for the blind.
00:57:15 Well, they've determined that it has not cost effective.
00:57:20 However, Jehovah wants everyone.
00:57:24 To have a hope for the future.
00:57:27 Notice how our organization works hard to make the truth more readily available for those who are blind.
00:57:37 I can't wait to see birds.
00:57:41 I can't wait to see their little beaks chirp when I hear the sound of them.
00:57:47 I was fully cited until I was nine and then gradually started losing my sight when I was young.
00:57:53 I loved skiing.
00:57:55 I skied and enjoyed the outdoors.
00:57:58 We're really very busy in our life. We have my mother who's 85 and my aunt who's 92 that live here also.
00:58:06 So we have their lives to work around doctors and meals.
00:58:12 We have our theocratic life and we have our studies, our field service.
00:58:19 Our personal study.
00:58:20 I lead a very very full life.
00:58:23 I just
00:58:25 Happen to be blind.
00:58:28 In my early 30s I lost the use of my right eye.
00:58:33 He was quite sudden and I went to the doctor and following the examination he took me into his office and let me know that I would be blind in both eyes and its immediate response by me was fear.
00:58:48 But it was the ministry that gave me the greatest strength and confidence to go forward.
00:58:54 Throughout the United States branch territory there are about 20 million persons that are either blind or suffer from low vision.
00:59:02 And in response to that, the organization has produced Braille literature and a number of languages.
00:59:09 Also audio files as well as electronic screen reader files.
00:59:15 Our principal function is to transcribe publications into Braille.
00:59:22 The transcription is done electronically.
00:59:25 By a program that has been produced in house and is part of the Watchtower translation system.
00:59:33 We produce Braille files that can be embossed into paper publication.
00:59:39 The screen reader and notaker files are uploaded to thejw.org website for use by blind and visually impaired persons.
00:59:51 Not being able to read and and having to learn to get these the spiritual truths in a different way is is quite a challenge.
01:00:03 That's where the audio recordings being able to hear I I am able to to do exactly what I used to.
01:00:07 Right?
01:00:12 1st Corinthians 922 says I have become all things to people of all sorts.
01:00:18 That I might by all possible means save some and, and we've taken those words to heart.
01:00:27 We want persons outside of our organization to benefit from the literature that we are producing for the blind.
01:00:33 Now, after attending an Expo for the blind, Janet recognize the vast potential.
01:00:38 That exists in the blind community for the good news.
01:00:41 The amount of blind people at the Expo.
01:00:45 It was astounding in the first thing that we.
01:00:48 Thought of was.
01:00:51 These people need Jehovah and immediately we came home and we called Bethel and told them what we saw.
01:00:58 We appointed a sign language circuit overseer to organize our participation at the event, and this was also beneficial because some persons who attended are both blind and deaf, thus could only benefit.
01:01:12 From tactile sign language.
01:01:16 We got together the week before and discussed how we were going to set up the table and the booth.
01:01:21 Some blind people prefer Braille and others prefer audio, so we had to have both available for them.
01:01:28 Anything that would attract those who are blind so they would come up to the table.
01:01:32 They could feel the Braille.
01:01:34 A literature.
01:01:36 They could feel the visual aids they could listen to a scripture about God, hope for the future.
01:01:42 So everything was tailored to those who are blind or visually impaired.
01:01:48 Our participation at these Expos has been tremendously successful.
01:01:54 Many times these individuals that are present are learning the truth for the first time.
01:01:59 61% of the people that we talked to gave us their contact information.
01:02:06 Everyone was very appreciative.
01:02:08 They all enjoyed what we had to show them and teach them.
01:02:13 Many of them left the booth with multiple.
01:02:17 Pieces of literature.
01:02:21 Some of those who approached the booth or so appreciative they gave us hugs.
01:02:26 Some sat down right then and there to have their first study.
01:02:32 It was a very special experience and it felt like we were opening a new form of ministry.
01:02:37 It felt like we were contacting our group of people that hadn't had the opportunity to know Jehovah before.
01:02:44 They can see the truth.
01:02:45 They can see the ring of truth in their minds eyes so many people thank you for being there.
01:02:54 This ministry is really unbelievable.
01:02:59 It's unlike anything I've done in my life.
01:03:05 This is just one of many examples that shows how an innovative witnessing initiatives.
01:03:15 Can help people of all backgrounds and circumstances to draw close to Jehovah.
01:03:24 One of our favorite segments on this program.
01:03:27 Is hearing how our brothers and sisters came in contact?
01:03:31 With the truth.
01:03:33 Oftentimes, the truth completely transformed their lives.
01:03:39 We are happy to share one such story with you now.
01:03:43 Brother John Lewis was raised in a non religious household.
01:03:49 However, he was exposed to the truth at a young age, but what caused him to later draw closer to Jehovah?
01:04:00 How does his story tie in with our theme for this month?
01:04:04 Honor Jehovah with your valuable things.
01:04:08 Brother Lewis himself will answer that question for us.
01:04:26 American motorcycles from my passion.
01:04:31 Second, it wasn't just the bike.
01:04:39 I had a Great American sports car.
01:04:42 I had a brand new house.
01:04:44 I had a good job.
01:04:46 I had the American dream and I had a great life.
01:04:50 I was.
01:04:50 Always looking for fun and I always seem to find it.
01:04:56 Even though I thought I had everything, there was still something missing.
01:05:00 The Vietnam War was brewing was raging, people were dying and it really bothered me.
01:05:07 When I was six years old, my aunt who just became a witness, she showed me this book and there's a picture inside.
01:05:14 I remember so well.
01:05:15 It's of Armageddon.
01:05:16 And that scares a little kid I thought I don't want to be there, but a few pages later there's a picture of the paradise I never forgot it.
01:05:24 Now is that I wanted to be there someday, so I thought maybe my head has something.
01:05:30 What have I got to lose so I called her.
01:05:31 I said, send over some witnesses.
01:05:35 So I had a couple of studies with the brother, but it didn't really make sense yet and my lifestyle hadn't changed.
01:05:43 I was 21 riding my motorcycle doing about 75 miles an hour because speed limits were for wimps, I hit a parked truck. I nearly died.
01:05:54 And as a result and now use this to walk.
01:05:59 Two days prior, I actually had witnesses over, but then my aunt invited me to a special talk given by the Watchtower Society president in San Francisco, and I said, OK, I'll see.
01:06:12 Well, you gotta remember this time the drug culture was in full swing and was part.
01:06:16 Of my life too.
01:06:18 And so I partied.
01:06:20 Got home after 2:00 AM.
01:06:22 But I tried something I prayed to Jehovah.
01:06:25 I said if you're real, if this is true.
01:06:29 Get me up in the morning.
01:06:31 Well, at 6:00 AM I woke up, could not sleep and I thought this is really weird.
01:06:37 And so at that I better go.
01:06:39 So I went with my aunt to this function and I thought if nothing else, I'll just check out the chicks.
01:06:45 Hey I was 21 but you and I found when I got there everybody paid attention when they brother said to turn to a scripture they all turned to that scripture. It was such a unified.
01:06:57 Group of harmony.
01:06:58 Something that I always want.
01:07:01 So I made rapid changes in my life.
01:07:03 I assume qualified to go out in public preaching.
01:07:06 Soon after that I was baptized and six months later I started in the full time ministry.
01:07:12 And so for over 40 years now my wife and I have enjoyed this work of going door to door and teaching others the Bible.
01:07:20 In 1998 I was dignified with the opportunity to serve as the apostle Paul did, visiting and encouraging congregations. I've had the chance to do that in different parts of the United States as a traveling overseer.
01:07:34 So really, I've gone from a life of pursuit of happiness, then never, never found it.
01:07:41 I tried to make it happen, but it wasn't there.
01:07:43 Now I have a life of purpose.
01:07:46 I have a family worldwide and I have a secure future.
01:07:50 What's better than that?
01:07:57 Did you notice how brother Louis story ties in with our theme for this month?
01:08:04 Brother and Sister Lewis have served in the circuit work since 1998.
01:08:11 As special full time servants they are honoring Jehovah to the full with their time and energy.
01:08:20 We truly appreciate our hard working circuit overseers and their wives.
01:08:29 Something that makes our literature so unique.
01:08:33 Is the unity it produces.
01:08:37 Our literature doesn't focus just on one country or one continent.
01:08:43 Instead, it fulfills the spiritual needs of our brothers and sisters worldwide.
01:08:51 How is that accomplished?
01:08:54 One very important factor is that branches around the world contribute to the content that we publish.
01:09:04 Let's visit one such branch and find out more.
01:09:14 The governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses provides spiritual food through our publications and website.
01:09:21 The writing desk supplies material to the writing department at the World Headquarters for publication.
01:09:27 We also archive historical material.
01:09:34 Newspaper clippings and experiences are sorted and filed in the cabinets.
01:09:39 These are translated into English and send to the writing department at World Headquarters.
01:09:45 Also, we arrange the shooting of photographs for articles.
01:09:50 These photographs help us to get a better understanding of what is being taught.
01:09:59 The archive team collects historical material of the witnesses in Japan, such as photos, applications from the early days, and other mementos which brothers have donated.
01:10:12 We take protective measures to save these precious items from damages caused by such things as light and humidity.
01:10:20 Also, we computerize a collection of items numbering 10s of thousands so that we can immediately find any of them from the database.
01:10:29 We use these items for exhibition displays as well as video programs produced at this branch or at the World headquarters.
01:10:39 Like a family album of Memories, the collection in the archives tells us much about our spiritual family, about their faith, courage, joys, challenges and about Jehovah's Guidance and support.
01:11:01 After a publication is published.
01:11:05 Or, uh, video is produced.
01:11:07 Considerable effort is expended to make it available in hundreds of languages.
01:11:15 As we mentioned earlier in the program.
01:11:18 170 remote translation offices need to be constructed in the next two years alone.
01:11:28 The purpose is to make sure people from all over the world.
01:11:33 Have access to Bible truth.
01:11:38 Revelation Chapter 7 verse nine speaks of a great crowd composed of many tongues or, as the footnote reads, languages.
01:11:48 This Bible prophecy has taken on new meaning in the past century of Kingdom rule, with translation now taking place in over 700 languages.
01:11:58 Many of these languages are operating from remote translation offices or rose.
01:12:04 One example is the country of Mozambique.
01:12:08 These offices are located in the area where the language is spoken rather than.
01:12:13 At the branch.
01:12:14 The remote Translation Office guidelines outline how the branch committee works along with the writing committee, publishing comedy, translation services and the World Wide Design Construction Department.
01:12:28 In considering relocating or starting a translation team in a remote location.
01:12:35 Artios are presently functioning in different ways in various parts of the world.
01:12:40 At times the personnel live in one location and work in another.
01:12:45 This includes using full time and part time commuters for both translation and support services.
01:12:54 The standard of facilities provided or the operation of the RTO may not be the same as the local branch at times.
01:13:02 The fastest way to start operation is to rent or purchase existing facilities and if needed carry out renovation work.
01:13:11 For example, this method was used to acquire.
01:13:15 The housing units for the American Sign Language RTO in Fort Lauderdale, FL.
01:13:23 If building a new RTO is the only option in an area, then standard plans have been developed for use construction servants work along with the original design construction departments in planning a project and then traveling into the chosen location and working along with local construction.
01:13:42 Turbans and volunteers in building the.
01:13:48 Artio construction gives both the local brothers and construction workers the joy of knowing they also are playing a part in reaching the hearts of people in their language.
01:14:02 The positive results in constructing autos is experienced by those involved in their construction and those who translate.
01:14:10 From there.
01:14:11 We just loved the project.
01:14:13 The RTO family is so much fun to work with.
01:14:15 It's a small family and so as we're caring for the needs of each other throughout the days and the weeks and the months, we just really find a lot of joy in it.
01:14:23 It's been a ton of fun and we get to.
01:14:25 Do it all in the shadow of a palm tree.
01:14:28 The greatest joy is that our brothers gave up their energy, and above all they work with much happiness for Jehovah.
01:14:31 He will show his magic from Terry.
01:14:36 Our recent relocation to the RTO home.
01:14:39 And office will fit.
01:14:40 So many of our translation needs going forward.
01:14:45 It helps us to hear and to speak the language every day because he's in the ministry and at meetings.
01:14:52 So that helps us to translate in a way our audience can easily understand.
01:14:57 When you go out in the ministry, you'll find that there are so many different ways something can be said, so you can have flavor in your translation working through.
01:15:08 Attending a car negation meeting with so many deaths really helps with translation.
01:15:14 Being in the audience when the information is presented at the meetings, a translator can see by the facial expressions of those around him.
01:15:22 If the information is clear and understandable, seeing them comment gives us an insight.
01:15:28 Into whether they really understand.
01:15:31 In just the last few years, over 300 rows have been established worldwide.
01:15:38 We have ahead of us plans for over 100 rose to be established in the next few years.
01:15:45 Jehovah is truly blessing this work so that people of all languages in the most distant parts of the earth may come to know him.
01:15:57 Our objective has always been to make our literature available to as many people as possible.
01:16:07 Recently, a secular book fair was arranged in the city of Guadalajara in Mexico.
01:16:15 Our brothers thought it would be the perfect opportunity to help the visitors learn more about the best book ever written.
01:16:25 The Bible.
01:16:38 Preaching where the people are is crucial.
01:16:40 And here there are thousands.
01:16:42 In a short time we can reach people that we wouldn't normally find at home.
01:16:46 A lot of young people visited us here.
01:16:48 I really like how you have it set up with books and brochures.
01:16:54 Teenagers have a lot of questions.
01:16:56 But they don't ask them.
01:16:57 If God is so powerful, why does he let us suffer?
01:17:00 That's a question a lot of people ask themselves, since we think of God as the Almighty and a lot of times.
01:17:06 That's why many people lose their faith.
01:17:07 Appearance of it.
01:17:09 One of my students is a Jehovah's Witness.
01:17:11 I was once able to get ahold of a copy of the book Young People Ask, and I found the information there very interesting.
01:17:18 Very complete, it's really helped me, in particular to raise my daughters.
01:17:23 Many people were surprised to learn that our publications are distributed completely free of charge.
01:17:29 What caught my attention is your generosity offering publications without expecting anything in return.
01:17:36 In fact, one person even seemed a bit annoyed, he said.
01:17:39 How is it possible that you don't charge for?
01:17:41 This he said.
01:17:42 This is worth a lot.
01:17:44 We were very surprised by the public response around 30,000 publications.
01:17:49 Were distributed.
01:17:51 In fact, just between volumes one and two of the book, Young People ask Answers that work. Some 8000 copies were.
01:17:57 So these two.
01:17:58 Are they free?
01:18:02 One of the main objectives of our booth was to draw attention to the content on ourjw.org website.
01:18:11 To begin with, what?
01:18:12 Really caught my attention with the video.
01:18:14 What has really?
01:18:15 Drawn people's attention, is there being able to watch the videos for themselves that really attracts them?
01:18:23 Kids learn through videos, so it's very important for us as humans to teach our kids values using these different tools.
01:18:34 As parents, our duty is to mop our children into persons with good principles, good values.
01:18:42 A teacher watched the whiteboard animation videos and that's what most impressed.
01:18:47 She said she's going to use him in a classroom.
01:18:50 From what I saw.
01:18:51 To me This site is very good, very educational.
01:18:54 I think it's great.
01:18:56 You can help thousands of people right from the intimacy of their homes where they're comfortable to consult Bible based information.
01:18:57 The persona.
01:19:04 If they had knocked on my door, I probably would have shut it on them, but I think.
01:19:08 This method is.
01:19:09 Very different to me.
01:19:10 It's a lot more dynamic.
01:19:12 I was one of those persons who would just take the literature and I was like just leave it with me.
01:19:17 Maybe I'll read it later.
01:19:18 I think that when we get ahold of a tablet or a laptop and we start opening webpages and especially the Jehovah's Witnesses site, you start seeing what you need without having to ask questions, and especially because the pages are so eye-catching.
01:19:32 What's happening here is really important, and I think what you people are doing is great.
01:19:36 I was a completely different person before, but this has helped my family to be more united.
01:20:05 What fine results will undoubtedly come from this new initiative.
01:20:12 The Central America branch received approval from the Service Committee of the governing body.
01:20:18 For this event.
01:20:20 Such requests are reviewed on a case by case basis.
01:20:27 We discussed earlier the new program for the entire brotherhood to share and funding the building of Kingdom halls.
01:20:38 Congregations with less financial resources would otherwise never be able to afford to build an appropriate Kingdom hall.
01:20:48 But with our joint efforts it is possible.
01:20:53 And very much appreciated.
01:20:56 The fact is highlighted.
01:20:58 In this report that was recently given to the Bethel families in the United States and Canada.
01:21:08 This year, Lynn Elder and I had the privilege to travel to South East Africa and visit the branches in Madagascar, Mauritius and Zimbabwe.
01:21:19 Our first stop was Madagascar.
01:21:22 Madagascar is simply a wonderful branch for preaching. There are 30,400 publishers conducting over 79,000 Bible studies and what helps is that the Malagasy people have a tremendous appreciation and respect for the Bible. It is not uncommon for individuals to give a donation.
01:21:42 For our literature with the last bit of money they have in their pockets, even if it means that they'll have no money for the next day and their typical responses, it's OK, it's for God.
01:21:55 And that level of appreciation has resulted in many progressive Bible studies.
01:22:02 One experience involved an elderly pastor named Lefty.
01:22:06 He met Jehovah's Witnesses for the first time in a neighboring village, about 20 miles away from where he lived.
01:22:12 He readily accepted a Bible study and even urged members in his church to travel to the meetings with him when they could.
01:22:20 Well sadly Lefty became sick and died. However, before his death he instructed the 74 members of his church that they should never leave Jehovah's Witnesses because they really read and study the Bible.
01:22:35 And they truly have the true religion.
01:22:38 He even left his house for them to use as a place for worship.
01:22:42 Well, did they heed his advice?
01:22:44 They did.
01:22:46 Every Sunday a group would meet together and left his house and with no one to study the Bible with them and not always able to travel to 20 miles to the neighboring village, they took whatever watchtowers they had and each week someone delivered a talk on one of the articles.
01:23:02 They knew a few Kingdom songs from attending the meetings, so they just sung what they remembered.
01:23:08 Two months ago, special pioneers was sent to this village.
01:23:12 This picture shows many of the children who live in the village, and that's left his house in the background.
01:23:18 The Pioneers reported that 78 people were regularly attending the meetings in Lefty House. They found that some in the group were drunkards, smokers, tradition followers.
01:23:30 But they had all made changes in their lives.
01:23:34 From what they read reading the Watchtower.
01:23:37 The house built by Lefty was now too small.
01:23:39 They had to use a public school for the.
01:23:41 Meetings and of course, when The Pioneers came Bible studies were started right away.
01:23:47 In fact, the folks in this village were so excited about studying the Bible that instead of waiting for The Pioneers to come to their home.
01:23:55 They all went to the home of The Pioneers.
01:23:58 They sit in the yard and they check in just like a doctor's office and they sit and wait until it's their turn to study.
01:24:05 It really is a beautiful thing to see how Jehovah can draw his people to him.
01:24:10 One of the highlights of this visit were the children who came to the branch to sing or record the Malagasy rendition of slow number 95, which is taste and see that Jehovah is good.
01:24:22 And as you know, this song was recently posted on jw.org, so we thought you might enjoy seeing part of that rehearsal.
01:24:32 Yeah, I.
01:24:46 Una fancy
01:24:51 Como Jody Mara.
01:24:55 Chick chick.
01:24:57 Aramis E nipu.
01:25:01 GZ
01:25:14 David, Anna
01:25:27 Like that?
01:25:30 Our next stop was Mauritius, the first Bethel in Mauritius was established in 1988, but since 1997 they relocated to the beautiful facilities that you see here in the pictures and there are 40 brothers and sisters that make up the Bethel family.
01:25:46 The women are truly a large army in Mauritius of the nearly 1800 publishers, 116 are pioneers, and of that number over 100 our sisters. They work so hard to carry out their ministry and they engage in various forms from public witnessing.
01:26:04 To preaching in the mountains, and Jehovah is truly blessing their efforts.
01:26:08 They are doing this with much good success.
01:26:12 Much of the work in the Mauritius branch involves translations and something that has had a tremendous impact on the brothers was receiving for the first time.
01:26:21 The song book in their native language, Morrison Creole and a number, were able to express their feelings of appreciation.
01:26:30 Jehovah has blessed us so much I'm so grateful.
01:26:34 It's a wonderful gift from Jehovah.
01:26:36 We've got the sound book in our mother tongue.
01:26:39 We can really praise Jehovah.
01:26:40 We are very happy that.
01:26:41 We got this song book in our mother tongue.
01:26:44 My final stop was Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe continues to be a buzz from the success of last year's International Convention and evidence of this has been the amount of increase in many aspects of the ministry. This includes all time peaks and magazine placements, Bible studies and memorial attendance. One nice experience involves.
01:27:05 The 20 year old young woman named bless it.
01:27:08 She obtained literature from one of our preaching carts and she was drawn to the truth right away.
01:27:13 She was a progressive student and quickly began attending the meetings.
01:27:16 In fact, bless it was so touched by what she saw and heard at the meetings.
01:27:21 It moved her to approach a sister in the congregation and expressed to her just how fortunate she was to be raised by Christian.
01:27:29 When bless it was given the invitation to attend the convention she readily accepted.
01:27:34 But imagine the scene on the first day of the convention.
01:27:39 When she bumps into her parents during the intermission.
01:27:43 Both were equally surprised to see the other, but bless, it was so excited she began interrogating her father with a barrage of questions, and so she started asking him, well, what are you doing here?
01:27:53 Who invited you?
01:27:54 How did you know about this?
01:27:56 Why did you never say anything?
01:27:58 Well, the father could not bear the interrogation anymore and he eventually confessed.
01:28:03 Your mother and I are Jehovah's Witnesses.
01:28:07 We've been inactive since you were born.
01:28:10 In fact, your mother used to serve as a regular pioneer.
01:28:13 Well, as you can imagine, the young woman was in total disbelief and later admitted just how angry she was at her parents for not raising her and her siblings and the truth.
01:28:23 But this motivated her to progress even more in four months.
01:28:27 She qualified to become an unbaptized publisher.
01:28:30 She ended her relationship with her boyfriend, even had the courage to terminate her employment.
01:28:35 Since she worked for an organization that was against Bible principles.
01:28:39 She became baptized and the best part is her parents, who were clearly affected by her example, have since been reactivated.
01:28:48 Even one of her siblings who used to make fun of her for studying the Bible is now an unbaptized publisher.
01:28:55 Another aspect of the work that is meeting with good success is the building of Kingdom.
01:28:59 Halls it is very difficult to get construction servants into Zimbabwe so much of the work is done by local brothers and as you'll note from these clips.
01:29:09 The work that they have been able to accomplish is tremendous.
01:29:14 Currently a Kingdom hall can be completed in six weeks in the rural areas and two to three months in other locations and over the past year 12 Kingdom halls have been built.
01:29:27 And another 115 are scheduled across the country.
01:29:32 It was a rainy season in Zimbabwe during the week of the branch visit and it rained all day every day and some of the hardest trains were on the day of the special program.
01:29:43 But despite the inclement conditions, 29,411 were in attendance and it was just so touching to see so many.
01:29:52 Paying attention and all the smiling joyful faces.
01:29:57 Despite the unfavorable conditions.
01:29:59 It even moved one news reporter who was there covering the program to ask what is it about you people?
01:30:06 How is it that this many people would come together to sit in the rain to listen to some talks about the Bible?
01:30:14 Will the brothers quickly arrange for someone to follow up on his interest?
01:30:19 The visit to these branches was evidenced that Jehovah is accomplishing wonderful things and blessing the work and the diligent efforts of his.
01:30:27 People and all along the way.
01:30:29 The brothers and sisters enthusiastically expressed that love and appreciation for Jehovah to the governing body and all of the hard work that is being done and accomplished by the Bethel families here in the United States as well as in Canada.
01:30:42 And it is such a privilege to be able to pass on to you there.
01:30:45 Warm love and greetings.
01:30:49 Don't you agree that this program has provided us with a number of examples of how we can honor Jehovah with our valuable things?
01:31:03 Yes, we can give of our time.
01:31:06 Our skills and other resources to further Kingdom interest.
01:31:13 As a summary.
01:31:15 We will enjoy a beautiful music video entitled.
01:31:20 Yes, you guessed it.
01:31:23 Honor Jehovah with your valuable things.
01:31:37 Over could possibly need.
01:31:40 He made everything.
01:31:44 From the start.
01:31:48 So what can I give him more?
01:31:52 How can I live in Norway that brings joy to his heart?
01:32:01 Now I know what it takes.
01:32:05 We beach day that breaks.
01:32:08 Here's what I will do.
01:32:12 Second, I live for you Jehovah.
01:32:25 As long as I may live.
01:32:28 No matter.
01:32:29 The one my friend.
01:32:35 All under you.
01:32:39 With my voice.
01:32:40 Are you both?
01:32:48 We love in your heart.
01:32:51 You have given us life and I treasure the joy that.
01:32:58 It rains.
01:33:02 More can night.
01:33:04 To to give honor to you, then to give you my valuable fish.
01:33:14 Yes, I know what it takes.
01:33:18 So with each day that breaks I.
01:33:23 So what I will do?
01:33:28 I'll give to you.
01:33:30 Jump over the best I have to give.
01:33:35 Live for you.
01:33:36 Jump over as long as I'm in live.
01:33:41 No matter one night.
01:33:45 Second, are you?
01:33:53 With my valuable
01:34:05 The words of proverbs 39 are etched in our minds and hearts after this month program.
01:34:15 We want to give our first fruits to Jehovah.
01:34:20 May all of us take the time to prayerfully consider what we can do to continue to live up to our dedication to Jehovah in all of the areas we have discussed.
01:34:33 To conclude our program.
