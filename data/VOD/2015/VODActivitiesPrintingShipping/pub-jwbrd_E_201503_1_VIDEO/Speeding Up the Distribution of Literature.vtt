00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:04.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the world, large shipping branches
can receive literature requests

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:08.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
from over 15,000 congregations a month.

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:12.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you consider
the number of publications and languages

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which these publications are available,

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
filling these requests could seem daunting.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how have we adapted
to meet this ever growing demand?

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:25.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades,
large conveyor systems were iconic

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our shipping departments.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Literature requests moved along belts

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:33.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were packaged by brothers and sisters.

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, conveyers operated only as fast
as the slowest worker

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:41.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and could not expand easily
for growth in additional languages.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in 2010, the Governing Body approved

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:47.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new shipping arrangement called

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pick to Cart.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first glance, a picking cart
might seem a bit old-fashioned

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to the conveyor system.

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, a closer look
reveals a different story.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once a congregation request
is ready to be filled,

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
a computer program,
which was prepared by our brothers,

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
calculates and assigns
all of the publications

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a specific number of cartons.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stipulates which carton size to use,

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the carton should be placed
on the cart,

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:19.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and which pallet it will eventually land on.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this information
get to the person filling the request?

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of a wireless network,

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
information appears
on a computer arm terminal

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is worn by each worker.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, address labels with bar codes

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
are printed for each carton.

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cartons are placed on a cart

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the direction shown
on the arm terminal.

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, by means of bar-code scanning,

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the setup of the cart
is verified for accuracy.

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
The arm terminal directs
our brother or sister

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the correct pick location,

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:54.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
displays the quantity needed for each item,

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even indicates
which box to put the item in.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bar code on the cart
is then scanned for verification

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
or possible errors.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once all of the items are verified,

00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
packing lists are generated automatically.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bar-code scanning verifies

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:14.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the packing lists
are placed into the correct carton,

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:18.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pallets are prepared
for shipment to the congregations.

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:22.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pick to Cart software monitors each pick
from each picking location.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
When needed, the software
automatically sends an electronic request

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:30.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to replenish the shelves with new literature

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the worker
always has literature available

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:34.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fill congregation requests.

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:37.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
The nine branches

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
currently using Pick to Cart

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
have already experienced many benefits.

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:43.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
One is speed.

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:44.881 line:10% position:50% align:center
With the use of carts,

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:46.916 line:10% position:50% align:center
individuals can move separately

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.551 line:10% position:50% align:center
at their own pace.

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has resulted
in approximately 100 fewer workers

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the branches using Pick to Cart
around the world.

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:57.594 line:10% position:50% align:center
Compared to other technologies,

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
the installation of the Pick to Cart system

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:02.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
is inexpensive and can easily be expanded

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support additional publications
and languages.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Previously, in many branches, each carton

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to be double-checked manually
before sealing.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, this step is now eliminated

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:17.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the accuracy
of bar-code scanning.

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:21.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pick to Cart process
has simplified and unified

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
shipping operations worldwide.

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most important,
it fills a vital role in ensuring

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our brothers and sisters
in the congregations

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
receive the exact literature
that they request

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:36.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
for use in their preaching work.

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
The publications put into these carts
are reaching hearts all over the world.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can call it “from cart to heart.”
