00:00:01 Around the world, large shipping branches can receive literature requests
00:00:04 from over 15,000 congregations a month.
00:00:08 When you consider the number of publications and languages
00:00:12 in which these publications are available,
00:00:14 filling these requests could seem daunting.
00:00:17 So how have we adapted to meet this ever growing demand?
00:00:22 For decades, large conveyor systems were iconic
00:00:25 of our shipping departments.
00:00:28 Literature requests moved along belts
00:00:30 and were packaged by brothers and sisters.
00:00:33 However, conveyers operated only as fast as the slowest worker
00:00:37 and could not expand easily for growth in additional languages.
00:00:41 So in 2010, the Governing Body approved
00:00:45 a new shipping arrangement called
00:00:47 Pick to Cart.
00:00:49 At first glance, a picking cart might seem a bit old-fashioned
00:00:53 compared to the conveyor system.
00:00:55 However, a closer look reveals a different story.
00:00:59 Once a congregation request is ready to be filled,
00:01:02 a computer program, which was prepared by our brothers,
00:01:05 calculates and assigns all of the publications
00:01:08 to a specific number of cartons.
00:01:10 It stipulates which carton size to use,
00:01:13 where the carton should be placed on the cart,
00:01:16 and which pallet it will eventually land on.
00:01:19 How does this information get to the person filling the request?
00:01:22 By means of a wireless network,
00:01:24 information appears on a computer arm terminal
00:01:27 that is worn by each worker.
00:01:29 Additionally, address labels with bar codes
00:01:32 are printed for each carton.
00:01:34 Cartons are placed on a cart
00:01:36 according to the direction shown on the arm terminal.
00:01:39 Then, by means of bar-code scanning,
00:01:42 the setup of the cart is verified for accuracy.
00:01:46 The arm terminal directs our brother or sister
00:01:49 to the correct pick location,
00:01:51 displays the quantity needed for each item,
00:01:54 and even indicates which box to put the item in.
00:01:58 The bar code on the cart is then scanned for verification
00:02:01 or possible errors.
00:02:04 Once all of the items are verified,
00:02:07 packing lists are generated automatically.
00:02:09 Bar-code scanning verifies
00:02:11 that the packing lists are placed into the correct carton,
00:02:14 and pallets are prepared for shipment to the congregations.
00:02:18 The Pick to Cart software monitors each pick from each picking location.
00:02:22 When needed, the software automatically sends an electronic request
00:02:26 to replenish the shelves with new literature
00:02:30 so that the worker always has literature available
00:02:32 to fill congregation requests.
00:02:35 The nine branches
00:02:37 currently using Pick to Cart
00:02:39 have already experienced many benefits.
00:02:42 One is speed.
00:02:43 With the use of carts,
00:02:44 individuals can move separately
00:02:46 at their own pace.
00:02:48 This has resulted in approximately 100 fewer workers
00:02:52 in the branches using Pick to Cart around the world.
00:02:56 Compared to other technologies,
00:02:57 the installation of the Pick to Cart system
00:03:00 is inexpensive and can easily be expanded
00:03:02 to support additional publications and languages.
00:03:06 Previously, in many branches, each carton
00:03:09 had to be double-checked manually before sealing.
00:03:11 However, this step is now eliminated
00:03:14 because of the accuracy of bar-code scanning.
00:03:19 The Pick to Cart process has simplified and unified
00:03:21 shipping operations worldwide.
00:03:25 Most important, it fills a vital role in ensuring
00:03:28 that our brothers and sisters in the congregations
00:03:30 receive the exact literature that they request
00:03:33 for use in their preaching work.
00:03:36 The publications put into these carts are reaching hearts all over the world.
00:03:40 You can call it “from cart to heart.”
