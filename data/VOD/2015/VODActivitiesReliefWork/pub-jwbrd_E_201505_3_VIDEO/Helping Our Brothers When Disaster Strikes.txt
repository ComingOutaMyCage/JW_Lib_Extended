00:00:01 Although many of our construction projects
00:00:03 are the result of growth in a branch territory,
00:00:07 our donations also are put to good use
00:00:12 when disasters strike.
00:00:15 The organization is quick to respond
00:00:17 to the needs of our brothers and sisters in affected areas.
00:00:22 This includes the distribution of relief supplies.
00:00:27 It also involves helping our brothers
00:00:29 repair or rebuild their homes and Kingdom Halls.
00:00:34 This was the case in 2011
00:00:38 when a large tornado
00:00:40 ripped through the state of Missouri,
00:00:43 in the United States.
00:00:47 When a disaster strikes, the Disaster Relief Desk takes the lead
00:00:52 in caring for the needs of the field.
00:00:53 This is done by using volunteers.
00:00:55 Our brothers know how to work together.
00:00:58 We’re using volunteers
00:00:59 that are used to crawling over each other
00:01:00 and working in a Kingdom Hall.
00:01:02 So they have the ability
00:01:04 to get into a disaster situation
00:01:06 and take direction and just take care of it.
00:01:08 It’s an evaluation process to see what’s needed.
00:01:12 Then the Purchasing Department, locally,
00:01:14 will then go ahead
00:01:15 and start buying materials.
00:01:17 Those will be delivered,
00:01:18 and volunteers will come to,
00:01:20 to prepare the home back to livable conditions
00:01:22 so that our brothers and sisters can get back into their homes.
00:01:26 So we stabilize the friends, we stabilize the houses,
00:01:28 we can stabilize the congregation.
00:01:31 We had a group of brothers
00:01:32 that went into Joplin, Missouri after the tornado
00:01:34 destroyed 30 percent of the city.
00:01:36 We had probably 30, 40 volunteers working on the house,
00:01:40 and a woman comes down the street from the neighborhood.
00:01:44 She sees all the volunteers working;
00:01:46 she thinks it’s a construction organization.
00:01:48 She says, “Can I pay you to come over and fix my garage?”
00:01:51 It was basically a shed
00:01:52 that had been picked up off the slab,
00:01:55 turned upside down, and moved a few feet away from the slab.
00:01:58 So the brothers said, “Well, let’s go take a look at it.”
00:02:00 So they went over and took a look at it.
00:02:02 It wasn’t that hard.
00:02:04 The shed was still intact.
00:02:06 They said, “We can do this in a few minutes.”
00:02:08 So they went and got all of their volunteers; they went over there; they picked the shed up
00:02:11 —they got about 30 brothers on it—
00:02:12 and they turned it over and put it on the slab.
00:02:15 And the woman was so thankful.
00:02:17 She says, “OK, so what do I owe you?”
00:02:19 They said, “No, we’re all volunteers; we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:21 We’re working through the local Kingdom Hall, here, relief center.”
00:02:24 And she says, “You’re kidding me.
00:02:26 You’re all volunteers?”
00:02:27 He says, “Yeah, and we’re out. . . ,” and she says, “What are you doing here?”
00:02:30 And he said, “We’re out working on our brothers’ and sisters’ homes,
00:02:34 and trying to help them get stabilized.”
00:02:35 She was in tears.
00:02:37 She came back down the street a few minutes later
00:02:39 with a wad of money in her hand.
00:02:42 She said, “I want to tell you a story.”
00:02:43 She says, “I called my church after this happened
00:02:47 “and I asked them to come work,
00:02:49 “to do this work for me, to put this shed back on its slab.
00:02:52 “They said, ‘We can do that. We’ll be there in about three weeks
00:02:55 and it’s going to cost you this much.’”
00:02:59 She says, “And here you folks come over to my house,
00:03:01 “you don’t charge me, you don’t even know who I am,
00:03:04 and you put my home back together —what I needed to have done.”
00:03:08 She says, “Here’s the money; you have this; you put it in your contribution box.”
00:03:12 When someone helps in building a Kingdom Hall,
00:03:15 when someone helps in building an Assembly Hall,
00:03:18 when someone aids in caring for a natural disaster,
00:03:23 their lives are changed forever.
00:03:26 When someone is benefited
00:03:28 by one of these programs,
00:03:29 their lives are changed forever.
00:03:35 The love demonstrated in the organization
00:03:39 is truly faith-strengthening to see!
00:03:44 The same arrangement to respond to disasters
00:03:47 is in place all around the world.
00:03:50 It is your contributions that make this possible.
00:03:55 For this we sincerely thank you.
