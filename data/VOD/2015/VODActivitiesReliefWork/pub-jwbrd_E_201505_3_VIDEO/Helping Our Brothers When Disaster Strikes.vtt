00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although many of our construction projects

00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:07.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the result of growth
in a branch territory,

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
our donations also are put to good use

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
when disasters strike.

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
The organization is quick to respond

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:22.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the needs of our brothers and sisters
in affected areas.

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes
the distribution of relief supplies.

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also involves helping our brothers

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
repair or rebuild
their homes and Kingdom Halls.

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:38.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the case in 2011

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a large tornado

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
ripped through the state of Missouri,

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States.

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:52.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a disaster strikes,
the Disaster Relief Desk takes the lead

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:53.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
in caring for the needs of the field.

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is done by using volunteers.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers know how to work together.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:00:59.609 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re using volunteers

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.777 line:10% position:50% align:center
that are used to crawling over each other

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.212 line:10% position:50% align:center
and working in a Kingdom Hall.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they have the ability

00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:06.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get into a disaster situation

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:08.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take direction and just take care of it.

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an evaluation process
to see what’s needed.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:14.524 line:10% position:50% align:center
Then the Purchasing Department, locally,

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:15.925 line:10% position:50% align:center
will then go ahead

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.427 line:10% position:50% align:center
and start buying materials.

00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those will be delivered,

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and volunteers will come to,

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare the home
back to livable conditions

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:26.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our brothers and sisters
can get back into their homes.

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:28.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we stabilize the friends,
we stabilize the houses,

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:31.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can stabilize the congregation.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a group of brothers

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
that went into Joplin, Missouri
after the tornado

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
destroyed 30 percent of the city.

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had probably 30, 40 volunteers
working on the house,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a woman comes down the street
from the neighborhood.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
She sees all the volunteers working;

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
she thinks it’s a construction organization.

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:51.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says, “Can I pay you
to come over and fix my garage?”

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:52.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was basically a shed

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:55.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had been picked up off the slab,

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
turned upside down,
and moved a few feet away from the slab.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the brothers said,
“Well, let’s go take a look at it.”

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they went over and took a look at it.

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t that hard.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
The shed was still intact.

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:08.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said, “We can do this in a few minutes.”

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they went and got all of their volunteers;
they went over there; they picked the shed up

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:12.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they got about 30 brothers on it—

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:15.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they turned it over
and put it on the slab.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the woman was so thankful.

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says, “OK, so what do I owe you?”

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said, “No, we’re all volunteers;
we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:24.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re working through
the local Kingdom Hall, here, relief center.”

00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:26.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she says, “You’re kidding me.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re all volunteers?”

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:30.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says, “Yeah, and we’re out. . . ,”
and she says, “What are you doing here?”

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “We’re out working
on our brothers’ and sisters’ homes,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to help them get stabilized.”

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:37.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was in tears.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
She came back down the street
a few minutes later

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:42.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a wad of money in her hand.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:43.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “I want to tell you a story.”

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says, “I called my church
after this happened

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I asked them to come work,

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:52.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to do this work for me,
to put this shed back on its slab.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They said, ‘We can do that.
We’ll be there in about three weeks

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s going to cost you this much.’”

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says, “And here you folks
come over to my house,

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:04.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you don’t charge me,
you don’t even know who I am,

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you put my home back together
—what I needed to have done.”

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says, “Here’s the money; you have this;
you put it in your contribution box.”

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
When someone helps
in building a Kingdom Hall,

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
when someone helps
in building an Assembly Hall,

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:23.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
when someone aids
in caring for a natural disaster,

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:26.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
their lives are changed forever.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
When someone is benefited

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:29.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
by one of these programs,

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
their lives are changed forever.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love demonstrated in the organization

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
is truly faith-strengthening to see!

00:03:44.207 --> 00:03:47.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same arrangement
to respond to disasters

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in place all around the world.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:55.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is your contributions
that make this possible.

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this we sincerely thank you.
