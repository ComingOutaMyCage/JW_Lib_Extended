00:00:01 The Governing Body has asked me
00:00:04 to use Proverbs 3:9
00:00:07 as the theme for the message
00:00:10 they would like to be shared
00:00:12 with the entire “household of faith” this month.
00:00:16 Let’s read that text together,
00:00:19 Proverbs 3:9,
00:00:22 and after we read it we want to consider,
00:00:26 what are “your valuable things”?
00:00:30 And, what does the verse mean by giving “the firstfruits”?
00:00:34 Let’s read Proverbs 3:9:
00:00:40 “Honor Jehovah
00:00:43 “with your valuable things,
00:00:46 with the firstfruits of all your produce.”
00:00:51 Let’s first talk a little bit
00:00:53 about what it means to offer our “firstfruits”.
00:00:59 In Bible times,
00:01:01 it meant the earliest fruits of a season.
00:01:05 So way before an Israelite knew
00:01:07 what kind of a harvest he would have,
00:01:10 whether it would be a bumper crop
00:01:13 or very meager returns,
00:01:15 with full faith and confidence
00:01:18 he was to give the “firstfruits” to Jehovah,
00:01:22 not just leftovers at the end of the harvest season.
00:01:27 Furthermore, the Hebrew word for “firstfruit”
00:01:31 is in the sense of being the best of that early season.
00:01:36 So the idea conveyed is not only first chronologically
00:01:41 but also first in quality.
00:01:44 In fact, Exodus 23:19
00:01:48 says this,
00:01:50 it says: “You are to bring the best
00:01:55 “of the first ripe fruits of your ground
00:01:59 to the house of Jehovah your God.”
00:02:03 The ‘best of the firstfuits’ would truly honor Jehovah!
00:02:08 And the Greek term for “firstfuits”
00:02:12 comes from a root word
00:02:14 having the basic meaning of “primacy”
00:02:18 or “preeminence.”
00:02:21 Again, the idea, the best we have.
00:02:27 Proverbs 3:9 also indicated that we can honor,
00:02:32 or show respect and appreciation for Jehovah,
00:02:35 with our “valuable things.”
00:02:38 And, as stated at Revelation 4:11,
00:02:42 ‘Jehovah is truly worthy
00:02:45 of all the honor’ we can give him.
00:02:48 Not only do we owe it to him because he is our Creator,
00:02:53 he is worthy of it because of the kind of God he is.
00:02:58 But what are the “valuable things”
00:03:01 with which we can honor Jehovah?
00:03:05 What first might come to mind
00:03:07 are our material possessions, our finances.
00:03:12 Well that is true,
00:03:14 and we want to talk about this a little bit later.
00:03:17 But there are many other valuables
00:03:20 that a Christian can offer to Jehovah
00:03:23 to give him the honor that he is worthy of.
00:03:28 For example, our time!
00:03:31 Mr. Benjamin Franklin, a scientist and statesman, once said:
00:03:36 “Do not squander time,
00:03:39 for that is the stuff life is made of.”
00:03:43 Yes, time is a valuable resource,
00:03:48 and many of you dear ones are offering your valuable time
00:03:52 in the ministry each month.
00:03:55 Some of you are able to gift to Jehovah
00:03:58 70 or more hours a month
00:04:01 in the ministry as regular pioneers.
00:04:05 While others of us are not in a position
00:04:08 to spend that amount of time in the field ministry,
00:04:11 we rejoice with those who can.
00:04:14 And interestingly, under the Law given to Moses,
00:04:19 the quantity of “firstfruits” to be offered
00:04:23 was not fixed.
00:04:25 It was left to the generosity and circumstances
00:04:29 of the giver.
00:04:31 He was to give his best, though,
00:04:33 no matter how much or how little that proved to be.
00:04:39 No matter what the amount then,
00:04:42 can we give the “firstfruits”  of our time in the ministry?
00:04:48 We do this by scheduling some time early in the month,
00:04:52 not just leftovers the last few days of the month.
00:04:57 Remember, we give Jehovah our “firstfruits.”
00:05:04 What other valuable things do we possess
00:05:07 that we can give to Jehovah, thus honoring him?
00:05:13 Well, many have construction skills
00:05:16 and other talents that they are willing to offer
00:05:18 for the building of Kingdom Halls,
00:05:20 Assembly Halls, remote translation offices,
00:05:24 and branch facilities
00:05:27 —including the large world headquarters complex
00:05:31 in Warwick, New York.
00:05:34 Jehovah is magnified
00:05:37 by such voluntary contributions
00:05:40 of energy and skills.
00:05:43 These are truly valuable things.
00:05:50 But now, I would like to address
00:05:53 the valuable things that may have first come to mind
00:05:57 —material possessions or financial giving and support.
00:06:03 As you know, for over 130 years
00:06:07 this organization has never solicited for funds,
00:06:12 and it is certainly not going to start now.
00:06:15 We don’t send out monthly statements to each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:06:19 specifying a dollar amount
00:06:22 that should be submitted to finance the work worldwide.
00:06:28 Most donations, in fact, are contributed anonymously.
00:06:34 Over the years, I have told various Bible students
00:06:38 that a person could attend our meetings for 20 years
00:06:41 and never put a penny in the contribution box,
00:06:45 and we would not know it.
00:06:47 Jehovah, of course, would know it, but we would not,
00:06:51 because the donations are anonymous but from the heart.
00:06:57 We don’t know who gives what.
00:07:02 But for a certainty, any donations received
00:07:07 do not line anyone’s pockets
00:07:10 and are not misappropriated.
00:07:13 They are all used in supporting theocratic endeavors worldwide.
00:07:19 As described in Matthew 24:45-47,
00:07:23 the Governing Body prayerfully and sincerely endeavors
00:07:28 to be not only the “faithful slave”
00:07:31 but also the “discreet slave”
00:07:35 in wisely managing the Master’s resources.
00:07:39 And please, dear brothers and sisters,
00:07:42 pray for Jehovah to help us to be successful
00:07:46 in being not only “faithful” but also “discreet.”
00:07:52 But often a member of the Governing Body
00:07:54 will be heard to say:
00:07:56 “In spending Jehovah’s money,
00:07:59 “we have to be more careful than we are
00:08:01 in spending our own money.”
00:08:06 And that is truly how we feel about the matter!
00:08:10 Yet, as you can well imagine,
00:08:13 millions of dollars are required each month
00:08:17 to finance the colossal Kingdom work
00:08:21 that is being supported by this organization
00:08:24 in some 239 lands.
00:08:30 Where does all of the financial support come from?
00:08:33 Largely from you dear brothers and sisters.
00:08:39 Most funds come from what you voluntarily put
00:08:43 in the contribution box in your Kingdom Hall.
00:08:48 Yes, that little box with a slot
00:08:51 that is labeled “Worldwide Work”
00:08:55 is primarily what finances
00:08:58 all of the theocratic initiatives
00:09:01 that have been implemented.
00:09:04 Of course, there are many other ways to contribute as explained, usually,
00:09:10 in the November issue of The Watchtower  each year.
00:09:16 Sometimes we may feel a little shy
00:09:19 to talk about the financial needs of the organization.
00:09:23 That is understandable
00:09:25 because we in no way want to be categorized
00:09:29 with other organizations, religious and otherwise,
00:09:34 that coerce their supporters to donate.
00:09:40 However, because all of us have the privilege to donate funds,
00:09:46 we would like to let you know something about our current situation.
00:09:51 Then you can respond as your heart impels you.
00:09:58 As you might have sensed,
00:10:00 I am not shy about this subject.
00:10:03 And why not?
00:10:06 It is because we have many Scriptural examples
00:10:09 of Jehovah’s faithful servants
00:10:12 making known the financial needs of the congregation.
00:10:17 Only when supporters of the Kingdom know the needs
00:10:21 can they respond accordingly.
00:10:24 For example, turn with me, please,
00:10:28 to Exodus chapter 35.
00:10:31 Now, think about this as you’re turning there:
00:10:34 The Israelites were in Sinai.
00:10:38 They were marching through a wilderness.
00:10:43 They did not have fields or businesses with money flowing in.
00:10:47 They just had what they had brought with them
00:10:50 when leaving Egypt.
00:10:53 Nevertheless, Jehovah instructed them
00:10:56 to build a place of worship.
00:11:00 Was Jehovah shy about letting the people know
00:11:03 about the material needs?
00:11:05 Well, read with me Exodus 35,
00:11:10 verses 4 and 5:
00:11:13 “Moses then said to the entire assembly of the Israelites:
00:11:19 ‘This is what Jehovah has commanded.’”
00:11:23 That wasn’t Moses’ command.
00:11:25 “This is what Jehovah has commanded,
00:11:30 “‘Take up a contribution for Jehovah
00:11:35 “‘from among yourselves.
00:11:37 “‘Let everyone with a willing heart
00:11:40 “‘bring a contribution for Jehovah:
00:11:45 gold, silver, copper.’”
00:11:50 You see, the people would not have known this need
00:11:54 if Jehovah had not informed them.
00:11:57 Very interesting, is it not?
00:12:01 The Governing Body very much feels the urgency
00:12:05 of accomplishing as much as we possibly can
00:12:09 in behalf of Kingdom interests
00:12:11 —knowing that “the great day of Jehovah is near!”
00:12:16 So in an effort to keep you informed
00:12:18 of the support that is needed for this great work,
00:12:23 I have the following information to share.
00:12:28 We have looked forward
00:12:31 to this next fiscal year
00:12:34 and projected the expenditures
00:12:36 for all of the theocratic initiatives we are scheduling.
00:12:41 In doing the math,
00:12:43 we found that the amount of money flowing out
00:12:47 will be much greater than the amount of money
00:12:50 that we have coming in at this time.
00:12:54 Well, why is that?
00:12:56 Does this represent a lack of appreciation for spiritual things?
00:13:00 No, absolutely not!
00:13:04 To the contrary,
00:13:06 we are witnessing unprecedented enthusiasm
00:13:10 among the brotherhood
00:13:12 for all the spiritual bounty that is coming our way.
00:13:17 We have up-to-date Bibles
00:13:20 and an abundance of printed literature,
00:13:24 and there is so much appreciation
00:13:26 for the new and continually improving
00:13:30 jw.org website.
00:13:34 From around the world,
00:13:36 we receive letters thanking the Governing Body
00:13:39 for JW Broadcasting®.
00:13:42 Many comment that it has brought us closer together as a people.
00:13:47 And as mentioned, starting this month
00:13:50 JW Broadcasting is available
00:13:53 in multiple languages.
00:13:56 We are thrilled about this development.
00:14:00 There is also excitement about public witnessing
00:14:03 using literature carts
00:14:05 —and with such great success.
00:14:08 No, the financial circumstance
00:14:12 has nothing to do with a lack of spirituality
00:14:15 or appreciation.
00:14:18 However, there are some facts
00:14:22 that we want to make you aware of.
00:14:27 For one thing, the financial needs in the field
00:14:32 have accelerated at a pace
00:14:35 unlike any time in the recent past.
00:14:39 A recent analysis of the need for Kingdom Halls
00:14:42 here in the United States showed
00:14:45 that some 1,600 new Kingdom Halls
00:14:50 or major renovations are needed,
00:14:54 not sometime in the future, but right now.
00:14:59 And worldwide we are in need
00:15:02 of more than 14,000 places of worship,
00:15:08 not including ongoing future growth.
00:15:13 In the past 15 years,
00:15:15 30,000 Kingdom Halls have been built.
00:15:19 Now if you figure that up, that averages to about 2,000 Kingdom Halls every year.
00:15:24 But in an effort to relieve the serious backlog more quickly,
00:15:29 we intend —Jehovah willing—
00:15:32 to complete 3,000 Kingdom Hall projects
00:15:36 every year going forward.
00:15:39 That’s a 50 percent increase.
00:15:42 Additionally, adjustments are being made
00:15:45 to simplify the Kingdom Hall design
00:15:48 in order to accelerate the construction schedule
00:15:51 and to save funds.
00:15:54 Though the design will be simplified,
00:15:57 the sheer number of Kingdom Halls
00:16:00 requires considerably more funds in the budget
00:16:04 than in times past.
00:16:07 Additionally, please think about this:
00:16:11 Today, how many publishing companies
00:16:14 print publications in the many languages
00:16:18 that Jehovah’s organization does?
00:16:20 The answer: None!
00:16:24 And why is that?
00:16:26 It’s because they cannot make a financial profit.
00:16:30 We, however, are accelerating our method
00:16:35 of translating publications
00:16:37 into indigenous languages.
00:16:41 This involves building or purchasing
00:16:44 regional translation offices,
00:16:47 or RTOs.
00:16:50 These will be strategically located in the part of a country
00:16:54 with the highest concentration of native speakers of the language.
00:17:00 Providing these structures in various regions of a country
00:17:04 reduces the need for costly construction expansion
00:17:08 at the local branch office.
00:17:10 But in the next two years, however,
00:17:14 upwards —now think about this—
00:17:17 of 170 of such facilities,
00:17:22 RTOs, are needed.
00:17:26 Depending on the country and the cost of materials,
00:17:30 an RTO can cost from about $1,000,000
00:17:35 to several million dollars each.
00:17:39 Hence, we have another reason we need to increase our finances.
00:17:45 We just felt that you dear brothers and sisters
00:17:49 needed to be made aware of these expenditures
00:17:54 that we are facing in the coming months and years.
00:18:01 We also have heard from circuit overseers and others
00:18:05 that some of the brothers and sisters
00:18:08 may have a misconception
00:18:10 about some of the recent policy changes
00:18:14 that have been instituted.
00:18:17 For example, all congregations
00:18:20 that had a Kingdom Hall or Assembly Hall loan to pay off
00:18:24 were informed that their mortgages were canceled.
00:18:29 Now if you think about that, that’s amazing, isn’t it?
00:18:32 All their loans were canceled.
00:18:35 Can you imagine a bank telling homeowners
00:18:38 that all their loans were canceled
00:18:41 and that they should merely send in to the bank each month
00:18:44 whatever they can afford?
00:18:47 Only in Jehovah’s organization could such a thing happen.
00:18:53 However, according to some of our circuit overseers,
00:18:58 some of us took this to mean
00:19:00 that the organization had a surplus of funds
00:19:04 and thus took this action,
00:19:06 as if the loans did not need to be reimbursed.
00:19:11 Could this misconception have affected the amount
00:19:15 that some have chosen to donate each month?
00:19:19 In actuality, the mortgages were canceled
00:19:23 so as not to be a hardship on some congregations and circuits.
00:19:29 The policy was founded on the Scriptural principle stated
00:19:33 in 2 Corinthians chapter 8.
00:19:36 Please turn there with me.
00:19:39 In an effort to help fellow Christians
00:19:43 who were facing financial hardship in the first century,
00:19:47 an arrangement had been put in place
00:19:50 to accept contributions from others
00:19:53 to help offset the deficiency.
00:19:57 About a year later, Paul is again writing to the Corinthians
00:20:02 about this policy of contributing
00:20:05 to offset the financial needs of others.
00:20:08 Now please read with me
00:20:11 2 Corinthians chapter 8,
00:20:14 and we’re going to read verses 10-15.
00:20:17 Here, the apostle Paul,
00:20:20 under inspiration, said this,
00:20:24 verse 10:
00:20:26 “And in this I give my opinion:
00:20:30 “This is for your benefit,
00:20:32 “seeing that already a year ago
00:20:36 “you not only initiated the action [that is of contributing]
00:20:40 “but also showed your desire to do it.
00:20:44 “So now, also complete what you started to do,
00:20:48 “so that your readiness to act [or contribute]
00:20:53 may be completed according to,”
00:20:56 now notice, “the means you have available.
00:21:00 “For if the readiness is there first,
00:21:04 “it is especially acceptable
00:21:06 “according to what a person has,
00:21:09 “not according to what a person does not have.
00:21:13 “For I do not want to make it easy for others,
00:21:16 “but difficult for you;
00:21:18 “but that by means of an equalizing,
00:21:23 “your surplus at the present time
00:21:27 “might offset their need,
00:21:29 “so that their surplus
00:21:32 “might also offset your deficiency,
00:21:35 “that there may be an equalizing.
00:21:40 “Just as it is written:
00:21:42 “‘The person with much did not have too much,
00:21:46 and the person with little did not have too little.’”
00:21:52 So that was the Scriptural basis
00:21:54 for canceling all loan repayments.
00:21:58 It was not because the organization had a large surplus of funds
00:22:03 and thus could “afford” to cancel these mortgages.
00:22:08 As explained at the time,
00:22:10 it was to equalize the reimbursement of such expenditures
00:22:15 over the entire brotherhood.
00:22:18 Some businessmen in the secular world
00:22:21 might think this was a disastrous policy change.
00:22:27 However, we know the spirit of Jehovah’s faithful servants.
00:22:32 We all feel privileged
00:22:34 to be able to help the growing brotherhood
00:22:37 to have comfortable places to meet
00:22:40 and praise Jehovah.
00:22:42 Think about this comparison:
00:22:45 Back in 1990 when the decision was made
00:22:49 to distribute our literature free of charge,
00:22:53 some within the organization,
00:22:56 and many outside the organization,
00:22:59 thought this would be financial suicide.
00:23:03 However, you dear brothers and sisters
00:23:07 have proved those predictions completely wrong!
00:23:12 Jesus said at Matthew 11:19:
00:23:15 “All the same,
00:23:17 wisdom is proved righteous by its works.”
00:23:21 Our individual voluntary donations
00:23:23 have combined to take care of the cost
00:23:26 associated with producing our literature,
00:23:30 and we are confident that the same will prove true
00:23:33 regarding the decision to cancel all Kingdom Hall
00:23:37 and Assembly Hall loans.
00:23:40 So instead of conveying the message
00:23:44 that the organization needed less in the way of donations,
00:23:48 the intent was really just the opposite.
00:23:52 But we have confidence that our hearts
00:23:55 will be moved to contribute what we can each month
00:24:00 to offset the necessary expense
00:24:03 of building new meeting places
00:24:06 for our brothers worldwide.
00:24:10 Another misimpression that has been brought to our attention
00:24:15 is that the sale of property in New York City
00:24:18 means that fewer donations are needed.
00:24:22 To help put things in proper perspective, however,
00:24:26 selling one of the significant properties in New York
00:24:31 really only covered the operating expenses
00:24:34 for the worldwide work for a few weeks
00:24:38 —now that’s one significant property.
00:24:42 And in actuality, the sale of property in New York City
00:24:47 is basically only financing the construction
00:24:50 of the world headquarters in Warwick
00:24:53 and the purchase of other properties
00:24:56 that are needed to facilitate the move
00:24:59 from Brooklyn in the future.
00:25:02 But on top of that, as mentioned,
00:25:05 we are planning on accelerating
00:25:07 the building of Kingdom Halls
00:25:09 and Remote Translation Offices in coming years.
00:25:14 It is our desire, Jehovah willing,
00:25:19 to hold to the accelerated schedule
00:25:21 for these projects, if at all possible,
00:25:25 rather than have to scale back such progress
00:25:29 because of a lack of available funds.
00:25:36 Again, we are not in any way desirous
00:25:40 of creating a hardship on anyone.
00:25:43 However, we felt
00:25:45 that if you knew the circumstances accurately
00:25:48 you would apply Proverbs 3:27
00:25:52 to this situation.
00:25:54 There we’re encouraged
00:25:57 not to ‘withhold what is good,’
00:26:00 but then the scripture adds,
00:26:02 ‘if it is within our power to help.’
00:26:08 And I might mention that this is true
00:26:11 even of publishers in less affluent countries.
00:26:16 It is encouraging to note
00:26:18 that even in lands with limited resources
00:26:22 the very poor contribute
00:26:24 to the cost of their Kingdom Hall and its maintenance.
00:26:28 We’re all Jehovah’s united people.
00:26:31 Even if we do not have much materially,
00:26:35 if our heart is willing,
00:26:37 there is usually something we can do
00:26:41 —even if it is merely offering
00:26:44 “two small coins of very little value”
00:26:47 as the poor widow did.
00:26:51 And how did Jesus feel about her for doing this?
00:26:55 He highly praised her
00:26:57 in Mark 12:42-44.
00:27:02 And if we think about it,
00:27:04 a small donation
00:27:07 from each of many of Jehovah’s people
00:27:09 adds up to a large amount of dedicated funds
00:27:13 that can be used powerfully by Jehovah’s organization.
00:27:19 Please turn back to Exodus chapter 35.
00:27:25 As mentioned, Jehovah was not shy
00:27:28 about informing his people
00:27:30 of the financial needs for true worship.
00:27:34 But once the need was known,
00:27:37 what was the initial result?
00:27:40 Exodus 35, and let’s read verse 21,
00:27:44 and the first part of verse 22:
00:27:48 “Then everyone whose heart impelled him
00:27:53 “and everyone whose spirit incited him
00:27:56 “came and brought
00:27:59 “their contribution for Jehovah
00:28:02 “to be used for the tent of meeting,
00:28:06 “for all its service, and for the holy garments.
00:28:10 “They kept coming, the men along with the women,
00:28:14 each with a willing heart.”
00:28:18 And what were the final results?
00:28:21 Well, look at Exodus chapter 36
00:28:24 and we’re going to read verse 7.
00:28:26 Let’s see, did Jehovah have to scale back on the amount of work
00:28:31 because of a lack of material support?
00:28:33 Verse 7:
00:28:35 “The goods were enough
00:28:38 “for all the work to be done,
00:28:41 and more than enough.”
00:28:44 Yes, when the hearts of Jehovah’s people are motivated,
00:28:49 wonderful things happen!
00:28:53 The Governing Body wanted to make you aware
00:28:57 of the financial needs in the world field.
00:29:01 And we are confident
00:29:03 that with this knowledge your appreciative hearts
00:29:07 will move you to do what you can
00:29:10 to support the work at hand.
00:29:14 Yes, we can honor Jehovah
00:29:17 with our valuable things,
00:29:19 including the financial support of true worship.
00:29:26 But as we mentioned at the outset,
00:29:29 our valuable things include much more
00:29:32 —for example, our time, as we talked about, spent in the ministry.
00:29:38 May we all give our individual firstfruits,
00:29:42 the best we can do with our present circumstances.
00:29:48 Some are honoring Jehovah by moving to places
00:29:52 where the need for Kingdom preachers is greater.
00:29:55 That’s commendable!
00:29:57 We spoke of giving our skills and energy
00:30:00 to theocratic construction projects.
00:30:04 We appreciate all of you
00:30:07 who have honored Jehovah in this way in the past,
00:30:09 tirelessly working with Regional Building Committees
00:30:13 and in the Lands With Limited Resources program.
00:30:17 And we thank all of you
00:30:19 who will continue to support the construction of buildings
00:30:24 that will bring praise to Jehovah.
00:30:28 What other valuable things bring honor to Jehovah?
00:30:32 Many thousands are learning new languages
00:30:36 to be able to help spread the good news
00:30:39 to yet more deserving ones.
00:30:43 It may well be —now think about this—
00:30:46 that this organization
00:30:48 has the most multi-lingual speakers
00:30:51 of any organization on earth.
00:30:54 That’s amazing, isn’t it?
00:30:56 Still others honor Jehovah by expending themselves
00:31:00 on Hospital Liaison Committees
00:31:03 and Patient Visitation Groups.
00:31:07 Though you do so,
00:31:09 often behind the scenes with no limelight,
00:31:12 be assured that those you help
00:31:15 know what you do,
00:31:18 and the Sovereign of the universe
00:31:21 sees you and receives your gift honorably.
00:31:26 It is just as is stated at Hebrews 6:10:
00:31:30 ‘Jehovah does not forget your work
00:31:33 ‘and the love you showed for his name
00:31:36 ‘by ministering
00:31:39 and continuing to minister to the holy ones.’
00:31:44 There are also circuit overseers and Bethel family members around the earth
00:31:49 who give their best to Jehovah daily.
00:31:52 Some of you are faithful caregivers
00:31:55 of sick or elderly servants of Jehovah.
00:32:00 There is a wear factor that is hard to quantify.
00:32:05 But know that your God accepts such a gift of love
00:32:10 with full knowledge of what you have done.
00:32:15 Well, at this point, I will borrow the words of Paul
00:32:20 as he enumerated in Hebrews chapter 11
00:32:23 many men and women of faith,
00:32:26 but then said as recorded in verse 32:
00:32:31 “And what more will I say?
00:32:34 For time will fail me if I go on to relate about . . . ”
00:32:38 and then he listed others
00:32:40 who had honored Jehovah with their valuable things.
00:32:44 Similarly, time would fail us
00:32:47 if we tried to enumerate all of you dear ones
00:32:51 and all of the many ways you are honoring Jehovah
00:32:56 with your valuable things.
00:32:59 But may Jehovah continue to bless
00:33:03 each and every one of you who are doing so!
