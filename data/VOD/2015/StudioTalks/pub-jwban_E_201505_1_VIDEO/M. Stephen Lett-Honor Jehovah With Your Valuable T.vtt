WEBVTT

00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:04.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has asked me

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use Proverbs 3:9

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the theme for the message

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would like to be shared

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the entire “household of faith”
this month.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that text together,

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:22.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:9,

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:26.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after we read it we want to consider,

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:30.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
what are “your valuable things”?

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, what does the verse mean
by giving “the firstfruits”?

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Proverbs 3:9:

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Honor Jehovah

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your valuable things,

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the firstfruits of all your produce.”

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:53.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s first talk a little bit

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:57.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what it means
to offer our “firstfruits”.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:01.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bible times,

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:05.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
it meant the earliest fruits of a season.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:07.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
So way before an Israelite knew

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of a harvest he would have,

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:13.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it would be a bumper crop

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
or very meager returns,

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
with full faith and confidence

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:22.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was to give the “firstfruits” to Jehovah,

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just leftovers
at the end of the harvest season.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:31.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Furthermore, the Hebrew word for “firstfruit”

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in the sense of being the best
of that early season.

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:41.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the idea conveyed is
not only first chronologically

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also first in quality.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Exodus 23:19

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
says this,

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:55.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “You are to bring the best

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:59.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the first ripe fruits of your ground

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:02.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the house of Jehovah your God.”

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ‘best of the firstfuits’
would truly honor Jehovah!

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Greek term for “firstfuits”

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes from a root word

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
having the basic meaning of “primacy”

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “preeminence.”

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:26.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, the idea, the best we have.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:9 also indicated
that we can honor,

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
or show respect and appreciation for Jehovah,

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:38.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our “valuable things.”

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:42.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, as stated at Revelation 4:11,

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah is truly worthy

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:48.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all the honor’ we can give him.

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only do we owe it to him
because he is our Creator,

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is worthy of it
because of the kind of God he is.

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:01.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are the “valuable things”

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
with which we can honor Jehovah?

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
What first might come to mind

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
are our material possessions, our finances.

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:14.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well that is true,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to talk about this
a little bit later.

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are many other valuables

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:23.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Christian can offer to Jehovah

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give him the honor that he is worthy of.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, our time!

00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:36.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Benjamin Franklin,
a scientist and statesman, once said:

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not squander time,

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:42.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that is the stuff life is made of.”

00:03:43.907 --> 00:03:48.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, time is a valuable resource,

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many of you dear ones
are offering your valuable time

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ministry each month.

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:58.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you are able to gift to Jehovah

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
70 or more hours a month

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ministry as regular pioneers.

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:08.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
While others of us
are not in a position

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:11.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
to spend that amount of time
in the field ministry,

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
we rejoice with those who can.

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:19.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly,
under the Law given to Moses,

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:23.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
the quantity of “firstfruits” to be offered

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not fixed.

00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was left to the generosity
and circumstances

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the giver.

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:33.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was to give his best, though,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how much
or how little that proved to be.

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:42.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what the amount then,

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:47.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
can we give the <i>“firstfruits” </i>
of our time in the ministry?

00:04:48.237 --> 00:04:52.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do this by scheduling
some time early in the month,

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just leftovers
the last few days of the month.

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:02.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, we give Jehovah our “firstfruits.”

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
What other valuable things do we possess

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can give to Jehovah,
thus honoring him?

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many have construction skills

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other talents
that they are willing to offer

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:20.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the building of Kingdom Halls,

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:24.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assembly Halls, remote translation offices,

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and branch facilities

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:31.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
—including the large
world headquarters complex

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Warwick, New York.

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is magnified

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
by such voluntary contributions

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
of energy and skills.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are truly valuable things.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, I would like to address

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
the valuable things
that may have first come to mind

00:05:57.507 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
—material possessions
or financial giving and support.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:07.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you know, for over 130 years

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
this organization
has never solicited for funds,

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is certainly not going to start now.

00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t send out monthly statements
to each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifying a dollar amount

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:27.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
that should be submitted
to finance the work worldwide.

00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:33.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most donations, in fact,
are contributed anonymously.

00:06:34.243 --> 00:06:38.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years,
I have told various Bible students

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:41.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a person
could attend our meetings for 20 years

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:45.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never put a penny
in the contribution box,

00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:47.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would not know it.

00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:51.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, of course, would know it,
but we would not,

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:56.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the donations
are anonymous but from the heart.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know who gives what.

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:07.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for a certainty, any donations received

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:10.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not line anyone’s pockets

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are not misappropriated.

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:18.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are all used in supporting
theocratic endeavors worldwide.

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:23.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
As described in Matthew 24:45-47,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
prayerfully and sincerely endeavors

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be not only the “faithful slave”

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:35.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also the “discreet slave”

00:07:35.338 --> 00:07:39.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
in wisely managing the Master’s resources.

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:42.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please, dear brothers and sisters,

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:46.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
pray for Jehovah to help us to be successful

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:51.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
in being not only “faithful”
but also “discreet.”

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:54.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
But often a member of the Governing Body

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be heard to say:

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In spending Jehovah’s money,

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:01.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have to be more careful than we are

00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:05.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spending our own money.”

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:09.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is truly
how we feel about the matter!

00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:13.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, as you can well imagine,

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
millions of dollars are required each month

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
to finance the colossal Kingdom work

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is being supported by this organization

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:28.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some 239 lands.

00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:33.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where does
all of the financial support come from?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Largely from you dear brothers and sisters.

00:08:39.335 --> 00:08:43.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most funds come from what you voluntarily put

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:48.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the contribution box in your Kingdom Hall.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, that little box with a slot

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:55.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is labeled “Worldwide Work”

00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:58.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
is primarily what finances

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:01.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the theocratic initiatives

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have been implemented.

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:10.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, there are many other ways
to contribute as explained, usually,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the November issue
of <i>The Watchtower</i>  each year.

00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:19.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we may feel a little shy

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:23.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk about the financial needs
of the organization.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is understandable

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:29.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we in no way want to be categorized

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:34.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
with other organizations,
religious and otherwise,

00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that coerce their supporters to donate.

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:45.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, because all of us
have the privilege to donate funds,

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:50.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would like to let you know something
about our current situation.

00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:55.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you can respond
as your heart impels you.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you might have sensed,

00:10:00.983 --> 00:10:03.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am not shy about this subject.

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:06.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why not?

00:10:06.088 --> 00:10:09.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is because we have
many Scriptural examples

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:12.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:17.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
making known the financial needs
of the congregation.

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:21.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only when supporters
of the Kingdom know the needs

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
can they respond accordingly.

00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:28.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, turn with me, please,

00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:30.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Exodus chapter 35.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about this
as you’re turning there:

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:38.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites were in Sinai.

00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:43.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were marching through a wilderness.

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:47.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did not have fields
or businesses with money flowing in.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just had
what they had brought with them

00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:53.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
when leaving Egypt.

00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:56.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, Jehovah instructed them

00:10:56.706 --> 00:11:00.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a place of worship.

00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:03.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Jehovah shy
about letting the people know

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:05.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the material needs?

00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:10.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, read with me Exodus 35,

00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:12.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 4 and 5:

00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:18.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moses then said to the entire assembly
of the Israelites:

00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:23.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This is what Jehovah
has commanded.’”

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:25.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
That wasn’t Moses’ command.

00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:29.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah has commanded,

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:35.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Take up a contribution for Jehovah

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘from among yourselves.

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:40.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let everyone with a willing heart

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:45.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘bring a contribution for Jehovah:

00:11:45.187 --> 00:11:48.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
gold, silver, copper.’”

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:54.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the people
would not have known this need

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:57.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Jehovah had not informed them.

00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:00.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very interesting, is it not?

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:05.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
very much feels the urgency

00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
of accomplishing
as much as we possibly can

00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:11.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of Kingdom interests

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
—knowing that “the great day of Jehovah
is near!”

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:18.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in an effort to keep you informed

00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the support that is needed
for this great work,

00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:26.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have the following information to share.

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have looked forward

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:34.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this next fiscal year

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and projected the expenditures

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of the theocratic initiatives
we are scheduling.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
In doing the math,

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:47.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
we found
that the amount of money flowing out

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be much greater
than the amount of money

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have coming in at this time.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why is that?

00:12:56.358 --> 00:13:00.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this represent
a lack of appreciation for spiritual things?

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, absolutely not!

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary,

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are witnessing unprecedented enthusiasm

00:13:10.973 --> 00:13:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the brotherhood

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:17.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the spiritual bounty
that is coming our way.

00:13:17.746 --> 00:13:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have up-to-date Bibles

00:13:20.249 --> 00:13:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an abundance of printed literature,

00:13:24.453 --> 00:13:26.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there is so much appreciation

00:13:26.922 --> 00:13:30.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the new and continually improving

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
jw.org website.

00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:36.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
From around the world,

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
we receive letters
thanking the Governing Body

00:13:39.435 --> 00:13:41.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
for JW Broadcasting®.

00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:46.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many comment that it has brought us
closer together as a people.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as mentioned,
starting this month

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:53.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW Broadcasting is available

00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:55.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
in multiple languages.

00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:59.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are thrilled about this development.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is also excitement
about public witnessing

00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:05.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
using literature carts

00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:08.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and with such great success.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:12.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the financial circumstance

00:14:12.535 --> 00:14:15.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
has nothing to do
with a lack of spirituality

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
or appreciation.

00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:22.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, there are some facts

00:14:22.144 --> 00:14:24.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we want to make you aware of.

00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:32.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
the financial needs in the field

00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:35.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
have accelerated at a pace

00:14:35.724 --> 00:14:38.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
unlike any time in the recent past.

00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:42.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
A recent analysis
of the need for Kingdom Halls

00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:45.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
here in the United States showed

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some 1,600 new Kingdom Halls

00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:54.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
or major renovations are needed,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:59.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
not sometime in the future, but right now.

00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:02.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And worldwide we are in need

00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:06.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 14,000 places of worship,

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
not including ongoing future growth.

00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:15.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past 15 years,

00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:18.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
30,000 Kingdom Halls have been built.

00:15:19.234 --> 00:15:23.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now if you figure that up, that averages
to about 2,000 Kingdom Halls every year.

00:15:24.607 --> 00:15:28.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in an effort to relieve
the serious backlog more quickly,

00:15:29.812 --> 00:15:32.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
we intend
—Jehovah willing—

00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:36.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
to complete 3,000 Kingdom Hall projects

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:39.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
every year going forward.

00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a 50 percent increase.

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:45.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, adjustments are being made

00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:48.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
to simplify the Kingdom Hall design

00:15:48.263 --> 00:15:51.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to accelerate
the construction schedule

00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:54.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to save funds.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though the design will be simplified,

00:15:57.773 --> 00:16:00.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sheer number of Kingdom Halls

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires considerably more funds
in the budget

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
than in times past.

00:16:07.483 --> 00:16:11.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, please think about this:

00:16:11.186 --> 00:16:14.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, how many publishing companies

00:16:14.523 --> 00:16:18.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
print publications in the many languages

00:16:18.127 --> 00:16:20.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s organization does?

00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:24.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer: None!

00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:29.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because
they cannot make a financial profit.

00:16:30.673 --> 00:16:35.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
We, however, are accelerating our method

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
of translating publications

00:16:37.312 --> 00:16:40.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
into indigenous languages.

00:16:41.483 --> 00:16:44.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves building or purchasing

00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
regional translation offices,

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
or RTOs.

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:54.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
These will be strategically located
in the part of a country

00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:59.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the highest concentration
of native speakers of the language.

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:04.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Providing these structures
in various regions of a country

00:17:04.573 --> 00:17:08.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
reduces the need
for costly construction expansion

00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:10.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the local branch office.

00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:14.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the next two years, however,

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
upwards
—now think about this—

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 170 of such facilities,

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
RTOs, are needed.

00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:30.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depending on the country
and the cost of materials,

00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
an RTO can cost from about $1,000,000

00:17:35.738 --> 00:17:39.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
to several million dollars each.

00:17:39.408 --> 00:17:44.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hence, we have another reason
we need to increase our finances.

00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:49.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just felt
that you dear brothers and sisters

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:54.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to be made aware
of these expenditures

00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are facing
in the coming months and years.

00:18:01.764 --> 00:18:05.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have heard
from circuit overseers and others

00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:08.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some of the brothers and sisters

00:18:08.203 --> 00:18:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have a misconception

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
about some of the recent policy changes

00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have been instituted.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:20.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, all congregations

00:18:20.115 --> 00:18:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had a Kingdom Hall
or Assembly Hall loan to pay off

00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:29.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
were informed
that their mortgages were canceled.

00:18:29.758 --> 00:18:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now if you think about that,
that’s amazing, isn’t it?

00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:35.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
All their loans were canceled.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine a bank telling homeowners

00:18:38.767 --> 00:18:41.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all their loans were canceled

00:18:41.637 --> 00:18:44.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they should merely
send in to the bank each month

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever they can afford?

00:18:47.676 --> 00:18:52.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only in Jehovah’s organization
could such a thing happen.

00:18:53.782 --> 00:18:58.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
according to some of our circuit overseers,

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of us took this to mean

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:04.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the organization had a surplus of funds

00:19:04.259 --> 00:19:06.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus took this action,

00:19:06.528 --> 00:19:10.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if the loans
did not need to be reimbursed.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could this misconception
have affected the amount

00:19:15.003 --> 00:19:18.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some
have chosen to donate each month?

00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:23.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
In actuality, the mortgages were canceled

00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:28.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
so as not to be a hardship
on some congregations and circuits.

00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:33.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The policy was founded
on the Scriptural principle stated

00:19:33.722 --> 00:19:36.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2 Corinthians chapter 8.

00:19:36.358 --> 00:19:38.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn there with me.

00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:43.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an effort to help fellow Christians

00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:47.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were facing
financial hardship in the first century,

00:19:47.536 --> 00:19:50.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
an arrangement had been put in place

00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:53.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept contributions from others

00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:56.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help offset the deficiency.

00:19:57.646 --> 00:20:02.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
About a year later,
Paul is again writing to the Corinthians

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
about this policy of contributing

00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:08.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offset the financial needs of others.

00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:11.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now please read with me

00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:14.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Corinthians chapter 8,

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:17.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 10-15.

00:20:17.532 --> 00:20:20.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, the apostle Paul,

00:20:20.168 --> 00:20:24.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
under inspiration, said this,

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:26.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 10:

00:20:26.408 --> 00:20:30.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And in this I give my opinion:

00:20:30.746 --> 00:20:32.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is for your benefit,

00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:36.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seeing that already a year ago

00:20:36.418 --> 00:20:40.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you not only initiated the action
[that is of contributing]

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:44.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but also showed your desire to do it.

00:20:44.126 --> 00:20:48.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So now, also complete
what you started to do,

00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:53.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that your readiness to act
[or contribute]

00:20:53.101 --> 00:20:56.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be completed according to,”

00:20:56.104 --> 00:21:00.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
now notice, “the means you have available.

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:04.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For if the readiness is there first,

00:21:04.112 --> 00:21:06.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is especially acceptable

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:09.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to what a person has,

00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:13.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not according to
what a person does not have.

00:21:13.055 --> 00:21:16.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I do not want
to make it easy for others,

00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:18.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but difficult for you;

00:21:18.627 --> 00:21:23.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that by means of an equalizing,

00:21:23.632 --> 00:21:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your surplus at the present time

00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:29.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
“might offset their need,

00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that their surplus

00:21:32.107 --> 00:21:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“might also offset your deficiency,

00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:40.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that there may be an equalizing.

00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:42.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as it is written:

00:21:42.684 --> 00:21:46.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The person with much
did not have too much,

00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:50.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the person with little
did not have too little.’”

00:21:52.127 --> 00:21:54.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was the Scriptural basis

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
for canceling all loan repayments.

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:03.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not because the organization
had a large surplus of funds

00:22:03.672 --> 00:22:08.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus could “afford”
to cancel these mortgages.

00:22:08.877 --> 00:22:10.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
As explained at the time,

00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:15.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was to equalize
the reimbursement of such expenditures

00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:18.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the entire brotherhood.

00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:21.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some businessmen in the secular world

00:22:21.823 --> 00:22:26.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
might think this
was a disastrous policy change.

00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:32.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we know
the spirit of Jehovah’s faithful servants.

00:22:32.234 --> 00:22:34.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all feel privileged

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to help the growing brotherhood

00:22:37.072 --> 00:22:40.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have comfortable places to meet

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and praise Jehovah.

00:22:42.978 --> 00:22:45.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about this comparison:

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:49.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 1990 when the decision was made

00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:53.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
to distribute our literature free of charge,

00:22:53.221 --> 00:22:56.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
some within the organization,

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:59.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many outside the organization,

00:22:59.327 --> 00:23:03.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
thought this would be financial suicide.

00:23:03.932 --> 00:23:07.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, you dear brothers and sisters

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
have proved those predictions
completely wrong!

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said at Matthew 11:19:

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All the same,

00:23:17.212 --> 00:23:21.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
wisdom is proved righteous
by its works.”

00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:23.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our individual voluntary donations

00:23:23.852 --> 00:23:26.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
have combined to take care of the cost

00:23:26.421 --> 00:23:30.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
associated with producing our literature,

00:23:30.258 --> 00:23:33.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are confident
that the same will prove true

00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:37.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the decision
to cancel all Kingdom Hall

00:23:37.699 --> 00:23:40.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Assembly Hall loans.

00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:44.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
So instead of conveying the message

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:48.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the organization
needed less in the way of donations,

00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:52.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
the intent was really just the opposite.

00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have confidence that our hearts

00:23:55.951 --> 00:24:00.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be moved to contribute
what we can each month

00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:03.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offset the necessary expense

00:24:03.725 --> 00:24:06.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
of building new meeting places

00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our brothers worldwide.

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:15.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another misimpression
that has been brought to our attention

00:24:15.003 --> 00:24:18.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that the sale of property in New York City

00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:22.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
means that fewer donations are needed.

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:26.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help put things
in proper perspective, however,

00:24:26.515 --> 00:24:31.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
selling one of the significant properties
in New York

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
really only covered the operating expenses

00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:38.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the worldwide work for a few weeks

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now that’s one significant property.

00:24:42.097 --> 00:24:47.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in actuality,
the sale of property in New York City

00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:50.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
is basically only financing the construction

00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:53.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the world headquarters in Warwick

00:24:53.942 --> 00:24:56.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the purchase of other properties

00:24:56.344 --> 00:24:59.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are needed to facilitate the move

00:24:59.281 --> 00:25:02.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Brooklyn in the future.

00:25:02.517 --> 00:25:05.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on top of that, as mentioned,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are planning on accelerating

00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:09.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
the building of Kingdom Halls

00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:13.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Remote Translation Offices
in coming years.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our desire, Jehovah willing,

00:25:19.134 --> 00:25:21.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hold to the accelerated schedule

00:25:21.903 --> 00:25:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these projects, if at all possible,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than have to scale back such progress

00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:33.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a lack of available funds.

00:25:36.151 --> 00:25:40.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we are not in any way desirous

00:25:40.188 --> 00:25:43.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
of creating a hardship on anyone.

00:25:43.091 --> 00:25:45.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we felt

00:25:45.227 --> 00:25:48.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if you knew
the circumstances accurately

00:25:48.563 --> 00:25:52.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
you would apply Proverbs 3:27

00:25:52.367 --> 00:25:54.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this situation.

00:25:54.369 --> 00:25:57.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re encouraged

00:25:57.005 --> 00:26:00.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to ‘withhold what is good,’

00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:02.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then the scripture adds,

00:26:02.043 --> 00:26:06.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘if it is within our power to help.’

00:26:08.283 --> 00:26:11.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I might mention that this is true

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:15.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
even of publishers
in less affluent countries.

00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:18.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is encouraging to note

00:26:18.727 --> 00:26:22.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even in lands with limited resources

00:26:22.197 --> 00:26:24.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
the very poor contribute

00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:28.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the cost of their Kingdom Hall
and its maintenance.

00:26:28.637 --> 00:26:31.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re all Jehovah’s united people.

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:35.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we do not have much materially,

00:26:35.076 --> 00:26:37.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
if our heart is willing,

00:26:37.612 --> 00:26:41.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is usually something we can do

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even if it is merely offering

00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:47.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“two small coins of very little value”

00:26:47.889 --> 00:26:51.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the poor widow did.

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:54.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did Jesus feel about her
for doing this?

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
He highly praised her

00:26:57.666 --> 00:27:01.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Mark 12:42-44.

00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:04.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we think about it,

00:27:04.673 --> 00:27:07.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
a small donation

00:27:07.008 --> 00:27:09.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
from each of many of Jehovah’s people

00:27:09.944 --> 00:27:13.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
adds up to a large amount of dedicated funds

00:27:13.782 --> 00:27:18.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can be used powerfully
by Jehovah’s organization.

00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:24.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn back to Exodus chapter 35.

00:27:25.493 --> 00:27:28.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
As mentioned, Jehovah was not shy

00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:30.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
about informing his people

00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:34.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the financial needs for true worship.

00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:37.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
But once the need was known,

00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:40.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was the initial result?

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:44.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exodus 35, and let’s read verse 21,

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:47.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the first part of verse 22:

00:27:48.783 --> 00:27:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then everyone whose heart impelled him

00:27:53.188 --> 00:27:56.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and everyone whose spirit incited him

00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:59.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“came and brought

00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:02.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“their contribution for Jehovah

00:28:02.864 --> 00:28:06.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be used for the tent of meeting,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for all its service,
and for the holy garments.

00:28:10.238 --> 00:28:14.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They kept coming,
the men along with the women,

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:17.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
each with a willing heart.”

00:28:18.813 --> 00:28:21.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what were the final results?

00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:24.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at Exodus chapter 36

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:26.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verse 7.

00:28:26.888 --> 00:28:31.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see, did Jehovah
have to scale back on the amount of work

00:28:31.226 --> 00:28:33.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a lack of material support?

00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:35.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 7:

00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:38.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The goods were enough

00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:41.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for all the work to be done,

00:28:41.703 --> 00:28:44.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more than enough.”

00:28:44.906 --> 00:28:49.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, when the hearts of Jehovah’s people
are motivated,

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
wonderful things happen!

00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:57.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
wanted to make you aware

00:28:57.018 --> 00:29:01.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the financial needs in the world field.

00:29:01.055 --> 00:29:03.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are confident

00:29:03.057 --> 00:29:07.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
that with this knowledge
your appreciative hearts

00:29:07.462 --> 00:29:10.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
will move you to do what you can

00:29:10.398 --> 00:29:13.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the work at hand.

00:29:14.035 --> 00:29:17.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we can honor Jehovah

00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:19.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our valuable things,

00:29:19.407 --> 00:29:24.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the financial support
of true worship.

00:29:26.748 --> 00:29:29.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we mentioned at the outset,

00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
our valuable things include much more

00:29:32.787 --> 00:29:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, our time,
as we talked about, spent in the ministry.

00:29:38.293 --> 00:29:42.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all give our individual firstfruits,

00:29:42.997 --> 00:29:47.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best we can do
with our present circumstances.

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:52.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some are honoring Jehovah
by moving to places

00:29:52.207 --> 00:29:55.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the need for Kingdom preachers
is greater.

00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:57.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s commendable!

00:29:57.579 --> 00:30:00.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
We spoke of giving our skills and energy

00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:04.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
to theocratic construction projects.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:07.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate all of you

00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:09.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have honored Jehovah
in this way in the past,

00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:13.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
tirelessly working
with Regional Building Committees

00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:17.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the
Lands With Limited Resources program.

00:30:17.365 --> 00:30:19.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank all of you

00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:24.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will continue to support
the construction of buildings

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:27.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will bring praise to Jehovah.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
What other valuable things
bring honor to Jehovah?

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many thousands are learning new languages

00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:39.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to help spread the good news

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
to yet more deserving ones.

00:30:43.324 --> 00:30:46.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may well be
—now think about this—

00:30:46.327 --> 00:30:48.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this organization

00:30:48.329 --> 00:30:51.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the most multi-lingual speakers

00:30:51.633 --> 00:30:54.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
of any organization on earth.

00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:56.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s amazing, isn’t it?

00:30:56.538 --> 00:31:00.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still others honor Jehovah
by expending themselves

00:31:00.542 --> 00:31:03.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Hospital Liaison Committees

00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:07.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Patient Visitation Groups.

00:31:07.148 --> 00:31:09.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though you do so,

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
often behind the scenes with no limelight,

00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:15.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
be assured that those you help

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
know what you do,

00:31:18.726 --> 00:31:21.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Sovereign of the universe

00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:26.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
sees you and receives your gift honorably.

00:31:26.067 --> 00:31:30.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is just as is stated at Hebrews 6:10:

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:33.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah does not forget your work

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:36.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and the love you showed for his name

00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:39.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘by ministering

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continuing to minister
to the holy ones.’

00:31:44.352 --> 00:31:49.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are also circuit overseers
and Bethel family members around the earth

00:31:49.324 --> 00:31:51.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
who give their best to Jehovah daily.

00:31:52.694 --> 00:31:55.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you are faithful caregivers

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
of sick or elderly servants of Jehovah.

00:32:00.268 --> 00:32:04.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a wear factor
that is hard to quantify.

00:32:05.573 --> 00:32:10.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
But know that your God accepts
such a gift of love

00:32:10.578 --> 00:32:14.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
with full knowledge of what you have done.

00:32:15.817 --> 00:32:20.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at this point,
I will borrow the words of Paul

00:32:20.655 --> 00:32:23.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he enumerated in Hebrews chapter 11

00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:26.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
many men and women of faith,

00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:31.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then said as recorded in verse 32:

00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:34.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And what more will I say?

00:32:34.002 --> 00:32:38.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
For time will fail me
if I go on to relate about . . . ”

00:32:38.072 --> 00:32:40.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he listed others

00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:44.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had honored Jehovah
with their valuable things.

00:32:44.178 --> 00:32:47.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, time would fail us

00:32:47.582 --> 00:32:51.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we tried to enumerate
all of you dear ones

00:32:51.653 --> 00:32:56.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of the many ways
you are honoring Jehovah

00:32:56.591 --> 00:32:58.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
with your valuable things.

00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:03.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may Jehovah continue to bless

00:33:03.264 --> 00:33:07.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
each and every one of you who are doing so!
