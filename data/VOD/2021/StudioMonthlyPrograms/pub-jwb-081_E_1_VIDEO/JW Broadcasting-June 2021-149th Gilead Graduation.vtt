Welcome to the June 2021 program
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 149th class of Gilead

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
graduated on January 16, 2021.

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:33.416 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The students were able

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to take full advantage of the school

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
despite the pandemic

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:40.423 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the extra efforts to remain safe.

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:45.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will they use their training
in this time of the end?

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:48.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they personally benefit
from the school?

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:53.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out in Part 1
of this historic graduation program.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has indeed been a unique class of Gilead

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a most unique time in world events.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:06.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bethel family is fully aware
of what transpired.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since this program

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be broadcast to our global brotherhood,

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let me remind all of you of what transpired.

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are well aware
of the unique time in world events

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a global pandemic!

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes this class so unique?

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:34.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A normal class of Gilead
consists of some 50 students.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 149th class is made up of just 25.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your class is abnormal.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:47.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know why.

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let me share your experience
with the worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:56.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who had been invited
to attend this class of Gilead

00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had begun to arrive at the Watchtower
Educational Center at Patterson, New York.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 25 students in this class

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:08.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually arrived in mid-March of 2020.

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we all know,

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:14.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was at that time that the coronavirus

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was declared to be a global pandemic.

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most travel was shut down.

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rest of their classmates could not come.

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of government restrictions
on educational facilities,

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:32.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 149th class had to be postponed.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You students were stuck at Patterson,
New York, with no classes in session.

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Commendably, many of you
were able to work remotely

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:48.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your home branch office in the interim.

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:51.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, here in New York,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government agencies
allowed for educational facilities

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to again conduct classes
if physical distancing could be maintained.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With just 25 of you,

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was possible in the Gilead lecture hall.

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have only 25 “abnormal” students

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:13.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will graduate today.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To clarify,

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is the number of students

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes this class “abnormal.”

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I am told by your instructors
that, individually,

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are very “normal.”

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they are very impressed
with your spirituality

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your Christian personalities.

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have excelled in your studies
and classroom participation.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a delight to be with you
on this very special day.

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:53.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else, though, makes this
an “abnormal” Gilead graduation?

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were not able to invite
family members and close friends

00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:01.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be here in person with you
for this exciting event.

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:05.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the Teaching Committee
made arrangements for you

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tie in a number of these ones

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:13.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a streamed recording of the program.

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:15.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good news is

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:19.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the entire program
is being recorded and will be posted

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:23.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a future JW Broadcasting monthly program

00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of the approved languages.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a few statistics
to share about the 149th class.

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of the 25 students, 8 are married couples;

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:40.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
7 are single brothers,

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:43.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are 2 single sisters in the class.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:46.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess they’re still single.

00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All were serving at a Bethel branch facility

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at a remote translation office
before attending school.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The students are from 14 different countries

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speak 29 different languages.

00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:06.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their average age is 41.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good age.

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty-four years ago, I was 41.

00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:16.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their average years 
in full-time service is 20<b>.</b>

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, Gilead referred
to a territory in Israel.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that name, “Gilead,”

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:29.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was derived from a Hebrew word
that meant “witness heap.”

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:34.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the school
was first inaugurated in 1943,

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Gilead” was an appropriate name.

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the instructors
described the purpose of the school,

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:44.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that it was
“to instill in the students

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a more intense desire
to share in the evangelizing work.”

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for decades,

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of missionaries were sent out

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to open up new territories around the world.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:02.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A “heap of witness” was given
during that period of time.

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in 2011,

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:09.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
adjusted the specific purpose of Gilead.

00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of focusing on opening up
new territories for preaching,

00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:18.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the purpose of the curriculum changed.

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we mentioned previously,

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:24.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this entire class was already serving

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a Bethel facility

00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:29.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a remote translation office.

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The goal of Gilead now

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:36.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to bolster such ones so as to strengthen

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize God’s people
in the respective territories

00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:41.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to which they will be assigned.

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:46.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, what about the all-important
evangelizing work?

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is assisting
with the “heap of witness” worldwide?

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:58.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s now the focus
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each Branch Committee
selects qualified pioneers

00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are willing to be transferred
to another part of the country

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:08.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that needs help with the preaching work.

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By using the large pool
of zealous local pioneers,

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:18.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “heap of witness” is still being given

00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the need is greater.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These local ones
are already adapted to the culture,

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:28.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
climate, and living conditions
in their countries

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, often times,
they already know the language

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there is the greatest need.

00:07:34.403 --> 00:07:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the 25 of you
in this class of Gilead

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are expected to strengthen

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:45.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize God’s people
where you are assigned.

00:07:46.682 --> 00:07:49.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that entail?

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For you brothers,

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:55.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time, it may mean that you
will be given more responsibility.

00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your training has given you another way

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stabilize fellow believers
in your assignment.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this applies to all 25 of you,

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether brothers or sisters.

00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:13.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been elevated while here at Gilead.

00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the territory of Gilead,
in the Bible,

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:22.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elevation changes dramatically.

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:24.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Jordan Valley,

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:27.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead was 690 feet,

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:31.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 210 meters below sea level.

00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But traveling east
to the domelike mountainous region of Gilead,

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elevation rises

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to over 3,300 feet,

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 1,000 meters.

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:50.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You students came to Gilead below sea level.

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:54.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with daily Bible study and lectures,

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:57.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have been elevated.

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the past five months,
your faith has grown.

00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your spirituality has been enhanced.

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Christian personality has been refined.

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:13.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been elevated.

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:16.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be going out to your assignment,

00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:19.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not so much for a “heap of witness,”

00:09:19.675 --> 00:09:22.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as a “heap of example.”

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:24.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will strengthen and stabilize

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those you work with at the branch

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those you associate
with in your congregations.

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:42.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Deuteronomy 8:17, 18.

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never forget that your power and strength,

00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:54.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your spiritual wealth,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not originate with you.

00:09:57.647 --> 00:10:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah who has made
this transformation in you.

00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me, Deuteronomy 8:17, 18:

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you should say in your heart,

00:10:11.894 --> 00:10:13.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My own power

00:10:13.896 --> 00:10:16.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the strength of my own hand

00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:18.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have produced this wealth for me,’

00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“remember that it is Jehovah your God

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who gives power to you to make wealth,

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to carry out his covenant

00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he swore to your forefathers,

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it is today.”

00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:40.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, you will graduate
from the 149th class of Gilead.

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you will strengthen
and stabilize those in your assignment

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you “remember

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that it is Jehovah your God

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gives power to you.”

00:10:56.939 --> 00:11:01.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For decades, we have been reminded
to read God’s Word daily.

00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was even painted
on the side of the factory building

00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Brooklyn for decades.

00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:14.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Splane is going
to take that a step further

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his theme

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:19.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enjoy Your Bible Reading.”

00:11:20.963 --> 00:11:24.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is a wonderful book.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a book
that we should just enjoy reading.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for this talk, I thought I’d give
a couple of suggestions

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for adding to our reading pleasure.

00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:36.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first:

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:40.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t pass quickly over the details.

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:42.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop and investigate,

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:46.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at times you’ll be very glad you did.

00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:48.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s take an example.

00:11:48.157 --> 00:11:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re reading in the book of 1 Chronicles.

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are
a lot of names in 1 Chronicles,

00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:56.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you come across the name Heman.

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are just interested
in covering material,

00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d probably pass over it
and go on to the next verse.

00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:03.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’re not in a rush,

00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:06.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you notice
a cross reference beside the name.

00:12:06.575 --> 00:12:10.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It refers you to 1 Chronicles 6:33.

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:13.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you decide to investigate,
and in doing so,

00:12:13.849 --> 00:12:16.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you learn something
heartwarming about Jehovah.

00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do that.

00:12:18.287 --> 00:12:22.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Chronicles chapter 6
(I’ll give you a moment)

00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 33,

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These are the men
who served with their sons:

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:36.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Of the Kohathites, Heman the singer,

00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:41.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
son of Joel son of Samuel.”

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:45.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this Heman was Samuel’s grandson.

00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we know
about his family’s situation?

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:53.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, his father, Joel,
and his uncle, Abijah, were judges.

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:56.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they had a terrible reputation.

00:12:56.258 --> 00:12:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d rule in your favor
if you could pay enough.

00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:01.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you were poor, forget it.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the whole country knew about it.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, the Bible says

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “all the elders
of Israel . . . came to Samuel”

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:14.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said they didn’t want
Joel and Abijah as judges anymore.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted a king;

00:13:17.513 --> 00:13:20.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was furious.

00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:24.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And He couldn’t have been too happy
with Joel and Abijah either.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine the effect
that this corruption had

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the reputation
of Heman’s family? the shame?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like Hezekiah,

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:39.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heman didn’t allow
his father’s bad example to paralyze him.

00:13:39.702 --> 00:13:44.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heman developed
his own personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:46.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We followed a few clues.

00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We followed a few cross references,

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we came to 1 Chronicles 25:5.

00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do that.

00:13:55.784 --> 00:14:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Chronicles 25:5

00:14:00.122 --> 00:14:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, again, we’re trying to find
something more about Heman.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All of these were sons of Heman,

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a visionary of the king in matters
pertaining to the true God to his glory;

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thus the true God gave Heman

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
14 sons and 3 daughters.”

00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:21.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see it?

00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A visionary of the king.”

00:14:24.146 --> 00:14:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was a visionary?

00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a kind of prophet.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s see.

00:14:29.852 --> 00:14:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel was a prophet,
and now Heman was a prophet.

00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see what’s heartwarming?

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:41.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was dealing with Heman
in much the same way

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had dealt with his grandfather.

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not hold the sins

00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fathers against the sons.

00:14:49.171 --> 00:14:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is something very,
very nice to remember.

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can you see where this example
would help some people you know?

00:14:56.946 --> 00:15:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even in full-time service
have a hard time with it

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had a rough family background

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may feel that they’re worthless.

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary is a case in point.

00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to call her Mary.

00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Mary’s father was so violent

00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:17.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at times Mary, her mom, and her siblings

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:20.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to get up in the middle of the night
and run for their lives.

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:23.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to the neighbors,
they were “that” family.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:26.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make it worse, they were poor.

00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:30.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all this made Mary feel worthless

00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:32.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until—

00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the day when she started studying
with the Witnesses.

00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:39.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She developed
her own relationship with Jehovah,

00:15:39.488 --> 00:15:42.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she accepted him as her Father.

00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:45.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, Mary is a pioneer.

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:47.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does she feel about her life?

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what she wrote:

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:54.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is constantly looking for those
who want a friendship with him.”

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s a touching point:

00:15:56.238 --> 00:16:00.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s even looking
into the hearts of children.”

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:02.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are two lessons here.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Heman’s example shows,

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:09.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our family background
doesn’t define who we are.

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will deal with us as individuals.

00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a second example,
one for the elders, is be like Jehovah.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:20.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Treat each member
of the family as an individual.

00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:23.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t lump them all in together.

00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:25.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to our second point:

00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:28.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can make our Bible reading more enjoyable

00:16:28.137 --> 00:16:30.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we try to fill in the blanks.

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:32.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s something
that our Bible dramas do.

00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:34.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fill in the blanks for us.

00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s illustrate:
Let’s consider the example

00:16:37.012 --> 00:16:40.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Queen Esther and the king’s son.

00:16:40.883 --> 00:16:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember the story.

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:46.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Ahasuerus,
who is understood to be Xerxes I,

00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was displeased with Queen Vashti,
and he decided he was going to replace her.

00:16:51.493 --> 00:16:56.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a call went out
into the whole Persian Empire

00:16:56.065 --> 00:16:59.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the most beautiful women
to be brought to the palace,

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Esther was among them.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the women were placed
under the care of a man named Hegai,

00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:10.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his job was
to get them ready to meet the king.

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we read Esther 2:9,

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we smell trouble.

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it,
and you see if you can figure out

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what trouble is looming here

00:17:22.758 --> 00:17:26.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Esther 2:9.

00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:28.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we’re trying to fill in the blanks.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:30.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re trying to imagine.

00:17:30.499 --> 00:17:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now the young woman [Esther]

00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:35.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was pleasing to him [Hegai]

00:17:35.904 --> 00:17:39.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and won his favor.”

00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a competition.

00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:44.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep that in mind.
This is a competition.

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he promptly arranged

00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:49.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her beauty treatments
and her [her] diet.”

00:17:49.618 --> 00:17:51.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait a minute.

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:53.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s another detail
we’ll have to pursue sometime.

00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:55.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther was Jewish.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was trying to hide the fact
that she was Jewish,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were so many things
the Jews couldn’t eat.

00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:01.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did she handle that?

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s for another day.

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:04.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s carry on.

00:18:04.032 --> 00:18:06.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And talking about Hegai, it says:

00:18:06.034 --> 00:18:10.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He assigned to her seven selected
young women from the king’s house.

00:18:10.939 --> 00:18:14.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He also transferred her

00:18:14.276 --> 00:18:19.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her young attendants
to the best place in the house of the women.”

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you smell trouble?

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:23.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the problem?

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preferential treatment.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a competition.

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:30.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s probably a lot of jealousy
going on among the candidates.

00:18:30.659 --> 00:18:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Hegai
is doing everything in his power

00:18:33.162 --> 00:18:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Esther to win the king’s heart.

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:38.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you suppose that went down?

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could have led to big trouble.

00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:42.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s another factor.

00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:44.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the king’s wives?

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there was only one queen,
but Ahasuerus had many wives.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some say he had 330 wives.

00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when Vashti was deposed,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who do you suppose
expected to become the queen?

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number two wife.

00:19:01.423 --> 00:19:04.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, instead of going
into the harem and choosing someone,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went outside the palace
—even to women who didn’t have royal blood.

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you suppose that went down?

00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:14.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now think about this:

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some scholars believe that although Vashti

00:19:18.207 --> 00:19:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was deposed as queen,
she didn’t leave the palace.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She just couldn’t ever see the king again.

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If she was still there,
as some scholars believe,

00:19:27.883 --> 00:19:30.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was she plotting in the background?

00:19:30.485 --> 00:19:34.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could have been
a very difficult situation.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Esther 2:15 tells us
something very interesting about Esther.

00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read just the end of verse 15

00:19:43.332 --> 00:19:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Esther chapter 2, at the end of verse 15.

00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All the while

00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Esther was winning the favor

00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:54.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everyone who saw her.”

00:19:54.843 --> 00:19:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther avoided the land mines.

00:19:58.013 --> 00:19:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that tell us?

00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:01.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was not only a very beautiful woman,

00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:04.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had a beautiful godly personality

00:20:04.486 --> 00:20:06.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a winning personality.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we said this was
about Esther and the king’s son.

00:20:11.193 --> 00:20:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is the king’s son—the heir?

00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:17.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we met him
at the convention this past summer.

00:20:17.699 --> 00:20:20.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the man
who was so nice to Nehemiah

00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:22.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Artaxerxes.

00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:25.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the historians
have their facts straight,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Artaxerxes would have been
only three years old

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Esther married his father.

00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:36.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, history tells us
that as kings of Persia go,

00:20:36.418 --> 00:20:39.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Artaxerxes had a very nice personality.

00:20:39.388 --> 00:20:41.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was mild, peaceable, kind

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so unlike his father,
who had a terrible temper.

00:20:45.027 --> 00:20:49.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to ask,
Did Esther have anything to do

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the pleasant disposition of Artaxerxes?

00:20:52.234 --> 00:20:53.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe she did.

00:20:53.902 --> 00:20:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows?

00:20:55.404 --> 00:20:57.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re using our imagination.

00:20:57.439 --> 00:20:59.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re trying to fill in the blanks.

00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:03.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we haven’t discussed
anything earthshaking here,

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that isn’t the point of this talk.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you investigate the details
and fill in the blanks,

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:14.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’ll contribute to the pleasure you derive
from reading the Bible.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:17.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if Bible reading
is a pleasant experience for you,

00:21:17.793 --> 00:21:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll have no trouble
to arrange a schedule

00:21:21.096 --> 00:21:23.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of daily Bible reading.

00:21:23.765 --> 00:21:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy!

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:29.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane.

00:21:29.571 --> 00:21:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoyed your presentation,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look forward to enjoying

00:21:35.177 --> 00:21:38.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible reading even more.

00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:43.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next on our program,
we will hear from Brother Seth Hyatt,

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:46.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Service Committee.

00:21:46.254 --> 00:21:49.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has the catchy theme for us

00:21:49.024 --> 00:21:52.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Do You Want Me to Do for You?”

00:21:52.694 --> 00:21:54.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Hyatt, please.

00:21:56.698 --> 00:21:58.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you agree.

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:02.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Gilead training has been a gift

00:22:02.871 --> 00:22:06.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a gift from Jehovah, Jesus Christ,

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:10.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:15.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you thought about how
you’re going to share your gift

00:22:15.183 --> 00:22:19.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow others
to benefit from your training

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:22.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you return to your assignment?

00:22:22.057 --> 00:22:24.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good question.

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:27.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we get back
to the busyness of a routine,

00:22:27.829 --> 00:22:30.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps the stress and anxieties

00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of increased responsibility,

00:22:33.001 --> 00:22:37.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing a gift may be
the last thing on your mind.

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:40.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good to think about it now.

00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:45.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help you to strengthen,

00:22:45.047 --> 00:22:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourage, motivate,

00:22:48.316 --> 00:22:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and instruct those who you oversee

00:22:52.654 --> 00:22:57.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your workmates, your brothers
and sisters in the congregation?

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:02.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can learn much from the way
Jesus dealt with people.

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:05.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like you, Jesus was entrusted

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a beautiful gift.

00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike you and me,

00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:14.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had some amazing abilities.

00:23:14.242 --> 00:23:17.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he could read hearts.

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:20.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures describe an occasion

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:24.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus responded to a man’s thoughts,

00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to his words.

00:23:26.922 --> 00:23:29.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think Jesus’ ability

00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:31.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know what his audience was thinking

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeling enhanced his effectiveness

00:23:35.864 --> 00:23:38.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he shared his gift?

00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:41.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:44.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But interestingly, the Scriptures reveal

00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:46.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus dignified people

00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:49.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way he communicated with them.

00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:53.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He often asked meaningful questions

00:23:53.081 --> 00:23:57.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listened attentively to the answers

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:01.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he shared his gift.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a few minutes this morning,

00:24:04.326 --> 00:24:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider two occasions
when Jesus did just that.

00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:13.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In doing so, we’ll get some pointers

00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:16.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will assist you

00:24:16.104 --> 00:24:20.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be effective in sharing
your gift of Gilead training.

00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:25.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first account is found
in the Bible book of Mark chapter 10.

00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:27.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there together.

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:31.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 35:

00:24:34.122 --> 00:24:37.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“James and John, the sons of Zebedee,

00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“approached him and said to him:

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:43.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Teacher, we want you to do for us

00:24:43.498 --> 00:24:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever we ask of you.’

00:24:46.168 --> 00:24:48.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:53.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What do you want me to do for you?’

00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:56.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They replied: ‘Grant us to sit down,

00:24:56.912 --> 00:25:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one at your right hand
and one at your left, in your glory.’”

The parallel account in Matthew

00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:08.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveals that James and John

00:25:08.623 --> 00:25:12.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not approach Jesus on their own.

00:25:12.227 --> 00:25:15.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had their mother do it for them.

00:25:15.497 --> 00:25:17.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think,

00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:21.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as this woman approached Jesus,

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:23.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knew what she wanted?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably.

00:25:27.475 --> 00:25:30.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he deal with her?

00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:33.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he interrupt her? reprimand her?

00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:35.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he asked a question:

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:48.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second account is just a few verses down

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:52.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 46.

00:25:52.601 --> 00:25:55.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we learn about a blind beggar

00:25:55.737 --> 00:25:58.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
named Bartimaeus.

00:25:58.306 --> 00:26:02.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sat by the road, and when he heard
that Jesus was passing by,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he called out: “Son of David, Jesus,

00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have mercy on me!”

00:26:08.917 --> 00:26:11.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The crowd tried to quiet him,

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:15.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Bartimaeus called out even more loudly.

00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:17.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus stopped

00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:20.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said: ‘[Bring] him to me.’”

00:26:22.597 --> 00:26:25.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Bartimaeus had an audience

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Son of God.

00:26:29.638 --> 00:26:33.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jesus address Bartimaeus?

00:26:33.308 --> 00:26:37.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 51: “Jesus said to him:

00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:41.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What do you want me to do for you?’

00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:45.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The blind man said to him: <i>‘Rabboni,</i>

00:26:45.487 --> 00:26:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let me recover my sight.’

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jesus said to him: ‘Go.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your faith has made you well.’

00:26:54.562 --> 00:26:57.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And immediately he recovered his sight,

00:26:57.932 --> 00:27:01.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he began to follow Jesus on the road.”

00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:07.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:09.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same question is in both accounts

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:12.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but very different situations.

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:18.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think Jesus asked this question?

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:20.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he accomplished

00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:23.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least four things.

00:27:23.258 --> 00:27:25.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were they?

00:27:25.293 --> 00:27:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,

00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:30.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he dignified his audience

00:27:30.198 --> 00:27:33.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by encouraging communication.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two,

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he allowed his audience to reveal

00:27:40.442 --> 00:27:44.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was in his or her heart

00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:47.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put it on the table, as it were.

00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:53.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his dealings with James and John,

00:27:53.121 --> 00:27:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the question actually protected Jesus

00:27:57.258 --> 00:28:00.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave him an opportunity

00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:02.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give those two apostles

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:06.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a valuable lesson in modesty:

00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:09.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This matter of giving
the right and left places

00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:12.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kingdom is not mine to give.’

00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:17.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, in the case of Bartimaeus,

00:28:17.912 --> 00:28:20.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you agree that the question

00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:24.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided an opportunity
to strengthen Bartimaeus’ faith

00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:28.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to give him effective assistance,

00:28:28.423 --> 00:28:33.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowing Bartimaeus to articulate his desire?

00:28:33.194 --> 00:28:35.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want?”

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then to experience
the immediate realization

00:28:39.934 --> 00:28:42.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have left no doubt in Bartimaeus’ mind

00:28:42.704 --> 00:28:44.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had been considered.

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:47.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did it affect him?

00:28:47.075 --> 00:28:51.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the account says:
“He began to follow [Jesus]

00:28:51.413 --> 00:28:53.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the road.”

00:28:53.882 --> 00:28:56.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful example

00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:59.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of asking a question

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:03.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps you to share your gift.

00:29:05.693 --> 00:29:08.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was
a newly appointed circuit overseer,

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders in a congregation
that I was serving

00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:14.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed concern about a sister

00:29:14.102 --> 00:29:16.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was missing meetings.

00:29:16.237 --> 00:29:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked me if I would be willing
to make a shepherding visit.

00:29:19.874 --> 00:29:22.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, I was happy to do that.

00:29:22.544 --> 00:29:24.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The arrangements were made.

00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:27.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another elder accompanied me,

00:29:27.482 --> 00:29:31.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I shared all of the appropriate verses

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:33.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about meeting attendance.

00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:36.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister listened,

00:29:36.224 --> 00:29:39.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as we were leaving,
she looked me in the eye,

00:29:39.894 --> 00:29:43.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said, “You don’t have a clue.”

00:29:45.633 --> 00:29:49.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time,
I thought she was being disrespectful.

00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:52.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I thought about it,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to wish
that instead of showing up

00:29:55.677 --> 00:29:58.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the appropriate verses,

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had showed up
with all of the appropriate questions.

00:30:03.318 --> 00:30:07.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:30:07.255 --> 00:30:09.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How may I help?”

00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:13.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What’s been happening in your life?”

00:30:13.127 --> 00:30:16.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those kinds of questions

00:30:16.197 --> 00:30:20.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allow you to render meaningful assistance.

00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:23.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned from that experience.

00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope you can learn from my mistake.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:29.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t make the mistake of thinking

00:30:29.644 --> 00:30:33.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know what a person wants or needs.

00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:37.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did know, and he still asked.

00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:42.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions

00:30:42.557 --> 00:30:45.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they dignify the audience;

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they allow your listener to reveal
what is in his or her heart.

00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:53.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may protect you,

00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it allows you
to render meaningful assistance.

00:30:57.972 --> 00:31:00.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approach your assignment

00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:03.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way Jesus approached his.

00:31:03.411 --> 00:31:06.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:08.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do,

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:12.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only will
you effectively share your gift,

00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:16.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be a gift wherever you serve.

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:20.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Hyatt,

00:31:20.528 --> 00:31:23.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for opening our eyes to Jesus’ question:

00:31:23.731 --> 00:31:27.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:32.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will now enjoy Brother Alex Reinmueller,

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:37.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Publishing Committee,
with the “inspiring” subject

00:31:37.178 --> 00:31:41.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let Jehovah Inspire You.”

00:31:43.184 --> 00:31:47.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had an important decision
suddenly thrust on you?

00:31:47.488 --> 00:31:50.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You thought you knew the right thing to do.

00:31:50.024 --> 00:31:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as you decide,
you start having second thoughts

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:58.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe even regrets—
and now you can’t stop thinking,

00:31:58.132 --> 00:32:00.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Did I do the right thing?’

00:32:00.301 --> 00:32:03.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tendency to repeat a thought

00:32:03.237 --> 00:32:06.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over and over again is called rumination.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when those thoughts make us feel anxious,

00:32:09.277 --> 00:32:11.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be bad for our health.

00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:13.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you students 

00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:16.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made tough decisions
before you came to this class.

00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:18.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that.

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everyone right now is faced

00:32:20.054 --> 00:32:23.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with challenging decisions every day.

00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:25.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do

00:32:25.226 --> 00:32:29.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stop anxious rumination once it starts?

00:32:29.631 --> 00:32:33.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37:5,

00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:36.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the advice
that is given to us here:

00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:42.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rely on him,

00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:47.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will act in your behalf.”

00:32:47.448 --> 00:32:50.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the word for “commit” here

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:54.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
literally means “to roll, or remove,
something from our life.”

00:32:54.188 --> 00:32:56.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as the footnote says,

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to “roll [our] way

00:32:58.192 --> 00:33:02.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[our concerns, our anxieties] upon” Jehovah.

00:33:02.196 --> 00:33:05.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we ruminate anxiously,

00:33:05.199 --> 00:33:08.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re holding on to our problem,

00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:10.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the Bible says that through prayer,

00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:13.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to take the problem off our shoulders

00:33:13.775 --> 00:33:15.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put it on Jehovah’s.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we no longer act
as if the burden is ours.

00:33:20.214 --> 00:33:23.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to leave it in his hands.

00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:28.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds so simple,
but at times, it’s hard to do.

00:33:28.056 --> 00:33:32.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us
when we have trouble letting go?

00:33:32.627 --> 00:33:35.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our suggestion today

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:39.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to let Jehovah inspire you with awe.

00:33:39.934 --> 00:33:43.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to inspire someone
means to make them feel

00:33:43.471 --> 00:33:46.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they want to do something and can do it.

00:33:46.841 --> 00:33:50.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it may be that Jehovah
gave us the emotion of awe

00:33:50.344 --> 00:33:52.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that very purpose.

00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:56.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be wondering now,
How can awe help me?

00:33:56.517 --> 00:33:59.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles again,

00:33:59.387 --> 00:34:02.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time to Genesis chapter 28.

00:34:02.957 --> 00:34:05.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s look at an example together

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:08.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that illustrates how this can work.

00:34:08.262 --> 00:34:10.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10,

00:34:10.264 --> 00:34:13.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we catch up with the patriarch Jacob.

00:34:13.201 --> 00:34:14.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s on the road.

00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:19.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice it says:
“Jacob departed from Beer-sheba

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept going toward Haran.”

00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:24.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was he going there?

00:34:24.178 --> 00:34:27.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the main reason
was to get away from his brother, Esau.

00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:32.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jacob had just made a tough decision.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Esau was mad.

00:34:34.722 --> 00:34:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the story.

00:34:36.724 --> 00:34:41.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For most of his life,
Esau despised the family birthright,

00:34:41.462 --> 00:34:44.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that upset Jacob very much.

00:34:44.298 --> 00:34:48.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at some point,
he purchased the birthright from him.

00:34:48.302 --> 00:34:51.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years go by, and then one day, 

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:56.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their father, Isaac, is getting ready
to bless Esau as the firstborn.

00:34:56.677 --> 00:34:58.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you picture the scene?

00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:02.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jacob going to do?

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not possible today
to know all the factors

00:35:05.787 --> 00:35:09.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that influenced Isaac,
Rebekah, and Jacob back then.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is,

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:15.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob’s decision
put a strain on the whole family.

00:35:15.163 --> 00:35:19.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esau began plotting to kill his brother,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why Jacob was on the road.

00:35:22.904 --> 00:35:25.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think he might have been ruminating

00:35:25.473 --> 00:35:27.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a bit that day on what happened?

00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:30.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he perhaps have second thoughts?

00:35:30.478 --> 00:35:34.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he asking himself:
‘Did I do the right thing?

00:35:34.348 --> 00:35:37.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Was it OK to fool my father?

00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:40.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah think of me now?’

00:35:40.354 --> 00:35:43.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those would have been reasonable questions.

00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
we don’t know what Jacob was thinking.

00:35:46.627 --> 00:35:49.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if he was having second thoughts,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened next

00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:54.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have helped him
to stop ruminating on them.

00:35:54.769 --> 00:35:58.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what we read in verses 11 and 12:

00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:01.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In time

00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:03.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he came to a place

00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:06.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and prepared to spend
the night there because the sun had set.

00:36:06.914 --> 00:36:09.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he took one of the stones of that place

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:13.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and set it to rest his head on
and lay down there.

00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:17.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he had a dream, and look!

00:36:17.024 --> 00:36:19.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there was a stairway set on the earth,

00:36:19.627 --> 00:36:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and its top reached up to the heavens;

00:36:23.664 --> 00:36:26.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there were God’s angels ascending

00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:29.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and descending on it.”

00:36:29.203 --> 00:36:32.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this heavenly ladder

00:36:32.306 --> 00:36:35.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have looked
like a rising flight of stones

00:36:35.209 --> 00:36:38.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the one you see here
in this illustration.

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:43.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob could see now
that he was not alone.

00:36:43.217 --> 00:36:45.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a small part

00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:48.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an awesome organization.

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:50.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is communication

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:53.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the different parts
of that organization.

00:36:53.661 --> 00:36:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angels minister in some important way

00:36:57.265 --> 00:37:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah and humans
who have his approval.

00:37:01.235 --> 00:37:03.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was more.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue in verse 13:

00:37:05.907 --> 00:37:07.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And look!

00:37:07.842 --> 00:37:12.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there was Jehovah stationed above it,
and he said:

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:15.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am Jehovah the God of Abraham

00:37:15.082 --> 00:37:18.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘your father and the God of Isaac.

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:20.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The land on which you are lying,

00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to you I am going to give it

00:37:23.624 --> 00:37:26.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to your offspring.’”

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting those words
must have been to Jacob!

00:37:31.432 --> 00:37:34.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wasn’t displeased with him.

00:37:34.168 --> 00:37:35.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quite the contrary.

00:37:35.703 --> 00:37:40.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promised to bless Jacob
in a marvelous way.

00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:44.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah apparently used
this awesome experience

00:37:44.712 --> 00:37:49.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Jacob to let go
of any anxiety he might have had.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as he continued to do his best,

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob could trust Jehovah to do the rest.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a relief!

00:37:58.159 --> 00:38:00.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his reaction in verse 17:

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he grew fearful and added:

00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:09.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How awe-inspiring this place is!

00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:12.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This can only be the house of God,

00:38:12.306 --> 00:38:16.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is the gate of the heavens.’”

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob’s relief here is almost palpable.

00:38:19.447 --> 00:38:21.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is no longer conflicted.

00:38:21.449 --> 00:38:23.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The vision inspires him

00:38:23.451 --> 00:38:27.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a vow of loyalty to Jehovah forever.

00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:29.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can read what he did and said

00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:32.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the latter part of this chapter.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, verse 17

00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:38.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses the same Hebrew word twice.

00:38:38.632 --> 00:38:42.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time it’s translated as “fearful,”

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second time as “awe-inspiring,”

00:38:46.674 --> 00:38:48.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that may be

00:38:48.676 --> 00:38:52.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because awe is a surprising emotion.

00:38:52.546 --> 00:38:54.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful mix

00:38:54.915 --> 00:38:57.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of inspiration and fear.

00:38:57.852 --> 00:39:00.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You sense you’re in the presence of someone

00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:03.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something greater than yourself,

00:39:03.357 --> 00:39:07.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it makes you feel small in a good way.

00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:11.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awe can humble you,
and that shifts your thinking.

00:39:11.832 --> 00:39:15.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps you to see things as they are

00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:17.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not as you expect them to be.

00:39:17.805 --> 00:39:21.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the kind of fear Proverbs 1:7 says

00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the beginning of knowledge,” or wisdom,

00:39:25.379 --> 00:39:28.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that may be why at times

00:39:28.082 --> 00:39:31.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah evokes awe in us.

00:39:31.085 --> 00:39:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jacob,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people often say they feel more centered

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spiritual after an awesome experience.

00:39:39.827 --> 00:39:43.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awe seems to pull us out of ourselves.

00:39:43.664 --> 00:39:47.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It connects us
on a deeper level with Jehovah,

00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:52.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it reconnects us
with what is most important

00:39:52.006 --> 00:39:54.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s sovereignty,

00:39:54.175 --> 00:39:56.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his creation, and his people.

00:39:58.946 --> 00:40:03.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, getting away from Esau
did not end Jacob’s problems.

00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:05.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were other times in his life

00:40:05.186 --> 00:40:09.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he again became very anxious and afraid,

00:40:09.723 --> 00:40:12.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but true to his word,

00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:15.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was always there.

00:40:15.229 --> 00:40:17.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as Jacob was faithful,

00:40:17.965 --> 00:40:21.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made sure he would succeed.

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:26.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty years later, when Jacob returned
to Canaan with his family,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sent out a company
of angels to greet him.

00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:33.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How awesome was that!

00:40:34.882 --> 00:40:38.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does all of this mean
then for you and me?

00:40:38.352 --> 00:40:41.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 89:7 says

00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:44.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is “awe-inspiring

00:40:44.492 --> 00:40:46.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all [those] around him.”

00:40:48.262 --> 00:40:53.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve ever hiked in Banff National Park

00:40:53.167 --> 00:40:56.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or walked in Muir Woods

00:40:57.304 --> 00:41:01.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or felt goose bumps as you looked up
into the night sky,

00:41:01.675 --> 00:41:04.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know what awe feels like.

00:41:04.512 --> 00:41:06.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve experienced

00:41:06.514 --> 00:41:09.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah inspiring you.

00:41:09.817 --> 00:41:13.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the next time you need
to get out of your head,

00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:15.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember awe.

00:41:15.689 --> 00:41:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a walk in the woods;

00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sing your favorite Kingdom song.

00:41:20.961 --> 00:41:24.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awe may be
the most underutilized way we know

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:28.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to stop ruminating
on anxious thoughts

00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fully commit our way to Jehovah.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let your problems stress you out.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your research, pray for guidance,

00:41:40.181 --> 00:41:42.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make the best decision you can,

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let Jehovah

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspire you with awe.

00:41:51.525 --> 00:41:54.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoyed that presentation, Alex.

00:41:54.728 --> 00:41:57.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have one of the Gilead instructors,

00:41:57.364 --> 00:41:59.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Trent Lippold,

00:41:59.366 --> 00:42:03.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the somewhat cryptic theme

00:42:03.003 --> 00:42:06.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mark Your Meribah.”

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lippold, what do you mean by that?

00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:13.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not miss the sign the first time,

00:42:13.747 --> 00:42:17.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the second time, it meant his life.

00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:19.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was Moses.

00:42:19.253 --> 00:42:21.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our lives are full of signposts

00:42:21.822 --> 00:42:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—figurative markers for lessons,

00:42:24.024 --> 00:42:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
memories, experiences.

00:42:26.227 --> 00:42:28.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some good, some bad.

00:42:28.495 --> 00:42:30.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some signposts we erect;

00:42:30.564 --> 00:42:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others are put up for us.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In either case, they should help us

00:42:36.103 --> 00:42:38.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue in life successfully.

00:42:38.939 --> 00:42:41.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, consider a lesson

00:42:41.942 --> 00:42:45.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a signpost—
in the life of Moses.

00:42:45.012 --> 00:42:48.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It happened
shortly after the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:42:48.048 --> 00:42:50.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s recorded in Exodus chapter 17.

00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:52.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a place called Rephidim,

00:42:52.586 --> 00:42:55.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites gathered and there was Moses

00:42:55.723 --> 00:42:58.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a crag with his staff

00:42:58.726 --> 00:43:01.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a quarreling nation.

00:43:01.195 --> 00:43:03.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The events there at Rephidim

00:43:03.464 --> 00:43:06.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided a significant lesson for Moses

00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:09.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something to remember
for future circumstances.

00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:12.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so he marked that spot.

00:43:12.606 --> 00:43:14.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do it?

00:43:14.608 --> 00:43:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He changed the name from Rephidim,

00:43:17.444 --> 00:43:19.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which means “Refresh,”

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Meribah,
which means “Quarreling.”

00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:25.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little did Moses know

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:28.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that name would ring in his ears.

00:43:28.656 --> 00:43:32.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirty-nine years later,
at a place called Kadesh,

00:43:32.593 --> 00:43:37.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was again near a crag with his staff

00:43:37.064 --> 00:43:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a quarreling nation before him.

00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:44.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on the events that happened there,

00:43:44.004 --> 00:43:48.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what is recorded
at Numbers 20:12, 13.

00:43:50.177 --> 00:43:54.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Numbers 20:12, 13, we read:

00:43:54.615 --> 00:43:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron:

00:43:57.818 --> 00:44:00.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Because you did not show faith in me

00:44:00.821 --> 00:44:04.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and sanctify me
before the eyes of the people of Israel,

00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:07.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will not bring this congregation

00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:10.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into the land that I will give them.’

00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:13.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These are the waters of Meribah,

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:16.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah,

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he was sanctified among them.”

00:44:19.206 --> 00:44:21.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses is taught a lesson here.

00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:25.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s unclear who exactly
named the place Meribah,

00:44:25.446 --> 00:44:30.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Moses did record
that these were “the waters of Meribah”

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an unforgettable signpost in Moses’ life.

00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:37.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What it meant to Moses was very clear.

00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:39.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what now?

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Moses do following this?

00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:44.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, from verse 14 (if we were to read it),

00:44:44.832 --> 00:44:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would see that Moses
carried on with his assignment.

00:44:47.568 --> 00:44:49.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued to lead the Israelites.

00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:52.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He led them against the Kings Sihon and Og.

00:44:52.506 --> 00:44:54.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to see Jehovah’s mighty arm of power

00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:58.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they drew closer and closer
to the Promised Land.

00:44:58.045 --> 00:45:00.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in his enthusiasm,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses makes one request of Jehovah.

00:45:03.217 --> 00:45:06.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turns to him, and we can read his words

00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:10.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Deuteronomy 3:25, 26.

00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:14.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses’ words in verse 25, he writes:

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:18.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Please let me pass over
and see the good land

00:45:18.365 --> 00:45:22.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is across the Jordan,
this good mountainous region and Lebanon.’

00:45:24.538 --> 00:45:29.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jehovah was still furious
with me because of you,

00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:32.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he would not listen to me.

00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:36.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, Jehovah said to me,
‘Enough from you!

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never speak to me again about this matter.’”

00:45:41.789 --> 00:45:46.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was still furious with me
because of you.”

00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:51.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meribah—that’s what Moses was referring to.

00:45:51.098 --> 00:45:53.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The signpost was clear for Moses.

00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:58.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would Moses respond to this?

00:45:58.071 --> 00:46:00.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would he do?

00:46:00.207 --> 00:46:02.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Moses carried on.

00:46:02.876 --> 00:46:05.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got back to work, back to business.

00:46:05.379 --> 00:46:06.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t finished.

00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:09.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued to lead and shepherd the nation.

00:46:09.249 --> 00:46:12.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prepared Joshua to be his successor.

00:46:12.085 --> 00:46:15.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he worked along until Jehovah 

00:46:15.155 --> 00:46:17.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to Moses and said to him,

00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:20.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moses, it’s time to go to the mountain.”

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:23.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, it was time for Moses’ death.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read, please, Jehovah’s words to Moses

00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:30.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Deuteronomy 32:51, 52.

00:46:30.838 --> 00:46:35.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in verse 51
of Deuteronomy chapter 32,

00:46:35.509 --> 00:46:37.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read Jehovah’s words:

00:46:37.511 --> 00:46:42.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because both of you
[that is, Moses and Aaron]

00:46:42.082 --> 00:46:46.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were unfaithful to me among the Israelites

00:46:46.386 --> 00:46:49.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh

00:46:49.957 --> 00:46:51.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the wilderness of Zin,

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:55.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you did not sanctify me
before the people of Israel.

00:46:55.929 --> 00:46:57.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will see the land from a distance,

00:46:57.931 --> 00:47:01.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will not enter the land
that I am giving to the people of Israel.”

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:08.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah draws Moses’ attention
back to Meribah.

00:47:08.609 --> 00:47:12.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What effect did this have on Moses

00:47:12.112 --> 00:47:15.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah referred to Meribah again?

00:47:15.115 --> 00:47:17.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think of this:

00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:20.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Jehovah’s refusal

00:47:20.087 --> 00:47:22.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reconsider his judgment on Moses,

00:47:22.723 --> 00:47:25.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses continued
fully dedicated to his assignment.

00:47:25.893 --> 00:47:29.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the details make up
the book of Deuteronomy.

00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at what happened

00:47:32.733 --> 00:47:35.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly before Jehovah’s words
here in chapter 32,

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:40.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find that Moses recited
a beautiful song of praise to Jehovah

00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:43.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
following Jehovah’s words.

00:47:43.043 --> 00:47:45.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 33, we find Moses here

00:47:45.712 --> 00:47:48.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving a blessing for the nation of Israel.

00:47:48.849 --> 00:47:51.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see what happened to Moses?

00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:54.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses marked the lessons
and experiences in his life,

00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:56.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Meribah.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not paralyzed
or broken by disappointment.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:05.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, his resolve
to serve Jehovah faithfully

00:48:05.265 --> 00:48:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was strengthened.

00:48:07.434 --> 00:48:10.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Moses?

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do it?

00:48:12.072 --> 00:48:15.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider at least two things
that may have helped Moses.

00:48:15.676 --> 00:48:20.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
Moses’ intimate friendship with Jehovah.

00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:24.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, why would Moses

00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:26.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even ask Jehovah

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reconsider his judgment on him?

00:48:29.056 --> 00:48:32.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Moses knew Jehovah intimately.

00:48:32.192 --> 00:48:35.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew him to be
“a God merciful and compassionate”

00:48:35.762 --> 00:48:38.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “abundant in loving-kindness.”

00:48:38.432 --> 00:48:42.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jehovah refused to reconsider,

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses did not say a word.

00:48:45.405 --> 00:48:47.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Moses knew that Jehovah

00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:52.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also a God ‘perfect in his activity

00:48:52.779 --> 00:48:55.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that all his ways are justice.’

00:48:55.515 --> 00:48:57.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, from Moses’ example, we see

00:48:57.784 --> 00:49:00.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the more intimate
our friendship is with Jehovah,

00:49:00.887 --> 00:49:04.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more intimately
he can teach us and train us.

00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:09.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thus, like Moses,
it will be easier to get past disappointment

00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:14.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue in our assignment
faithful and joyful.

00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:17.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a second thing
that may have helped Moses,

00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:19.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was Job.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Moses wrote the book of Job

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around 1473 B.C.E.,
around the same time as the events

00:49:26.913 --> 00:49:30.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that took place at Meribah of Kadesh.

00:49:30.751 --> 00:49:34.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words are fresh in his mind.

00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:38.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses knew how Jehovah dealt with Job.

00:49:38.692 --> 00:49:43.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Job 38:3,
Jehovah said to Job:

00:49:43.096 --> 00:49:47.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brace yourself, please, like a man;
I will question you.”

00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:51.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses knew how Job responded to his problems

00:49:51.905 --> 00:49:53.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jehovah’s correction.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Job 40:4,
Job said to Jehovah:

00:49:57.878 --> 00:50:00.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I put my hand over my mouth.”

00:50:00.547 --> 00:50:03.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Moses also knew
the final outcome

00:50:03.817 --> 00:50:06.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the matters with Job.

00:50:06.453 --> 00:50:09.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, Moses was able to see

00:50:09.823 --> 00:50:13.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own difficulties
and his own disappointments

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the prism of universal sovereignty,

00:50:16.229 --> 00:50:19.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that gave Moses perspective.

00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:23.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take advantage
of the inspired words of God

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at your disposal.

00:50:25.872 --> 00:50:27.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate deeply on the experiences

00:50:27.908 --> 00:50:29.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:50:29.876 --> 00:50:33.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like Job and like Moses.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These examples will give you perspective

00:50:36.983 --> 00:50:40.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow you to move on joyfully.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
the simple truth is that

00:50:43.023 --> 00:50:45.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our life of service to God,

00:50:45.559 --> 00:50:48.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be treated unfairly

00:50:48.328 --> 00:50:51.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will likely be disappointed at times.

00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our expectations may not be met,

00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:57.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will respond poorly at times.

00:50:57.871 --> 00:51:02.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark the moment
as a lesson in life—a Meribah.

00:51:02.542 --> 00:51:04.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if
—as was the case with Moses—

00:51:04.845 --> 00:51:08.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah marks it for you, be grateful.

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:12.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be paralyzed
or broken by disappointment.

00:51:12.419 --> 00:51:16.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Moses, fix in mind what you have to do.

00:51:16.523 --> 00:51:18.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow the experience or the lesson

00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:23.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen your resolve
to serve Jehovah faithfully and joyfully.

00:51:23.997 --> 00:51:28.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can—if you mark your Meribah.

00:51:31.138 --> 00:51:34.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we know
what you meant by the theme

00:51:34.441 --> 00:51:36.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mark Your Meribah.”

00:51:37.377 --> 00:51:42.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And speaking of “Mark,”
we will now listen to Mark Noumair,

00:51:42.048 --> 00:51:44.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another Gilead instructor,

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:48.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the theme “From Strength to Strength.”

00:51:49.222 --> 00:51:51.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all yours, Brother Noumair.

00:51:53.794 --> 00:51:57.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, it’s a privilege to address you

00:51:57.264 --> 00:52:00.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a very precious group of people.

00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:04.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your journey to this day
has not been an easy one.

00:52:04.404 --> 00:52:09.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we want to focus
on a specific journey

00:52:09.342 --> 00:52:12.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the one that began
when you were invited to Gilead

00:52:12.045 --> 00:52:15.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to your first day in class.

00:52:15.849 --> 00:52:20.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the lockdown,
that journey brought you unexpected trials

00:52:20.153 --> 00:52:23.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unknown to previous classes of Gilead.

00:52:23.323 --> 00:52:25.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along the way, you said many prayers

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:28.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even shed some tears.

00:52:28.862 --> 00:52:32.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But instead of giving into despair
(we’re so proud of you),

00:52:32.599 --> 00:52:35.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you became stronger.

00:52:35.302 --> 00:52:37.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your journey can be compared

00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:40.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the journey of a Levite,

00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:42.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as described in Psalm 84.

00:52:42.909 --> 00:52:46.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 84.

00:52:47.881 --> 00:52:50.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to review the man’s musings

00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:54.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he traveled from his home
to Jehovah’s temple

00:52:54.521 --> 00:52:56.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 84.

00:52:56.523 --> 00:52:59.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, we will learn what it means

00:52:59.292 --> 00:53:02.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find strength in Jehovah

00:53:02.229 --> 00:53:04.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what will help you to continue to go

00:53:04.698 --> 00:53:07.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from strength to strength.”

00:53:07.901 --> 00:53:10.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can begin at verse 5:

00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are the men

00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:18.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who find their strength in you.”

00:53:18.778 --> 00:53:21.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does this mean?

00:53:21.314 --> 00:53:25.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find strength means
you have to be looking for it.

00:53:25.752 --> 00:53:28.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we look to Jehovah for strength.

00:53:28.922 --> 00:53:30.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do that?

00:53:30.924 --> 00:53:35.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do that by prayer and focus.

00:53:35.128 --> 00:53:40.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray, we pray to Jehovah
for his holy spirit

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus on him.

00:53:42.168 --> 00:53:44.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives us strength.

00:53:44.504 --> 00:53:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at first, this strength
may be just enough

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:49.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start a difficult journey,

00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:53.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as you started
when you received your invitation to Gilead.

00:53:54.681 --> 00:53:59.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the journey continues,
you’ll become stronger

00:53:59.052 --> 00:54:01.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you take the right approach.

00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:04.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is that approach?

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:07.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read on, and we’ll go to verse 6:

00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:12.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they pass through the Baca Valley,

00:54:12.866 --> 00:54:15.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they make it into a place of springs;

00:54:15.869 --> 00:54:19.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the early rain
clothes it with blessings.”

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:24.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many routes
to travel to get to Jerusalem,

00:54:24.411 --> 00:54:26.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this Levite speaks of traveling

00:54:26.947 --> 00:54:29.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the Baca Valley,

00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s not the scenic route.

00:54:32.052 --> 00:54:34.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Baca Valley was a dry,

00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:37.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
desolate, parched area.

00:54:37.557 --> 00:54:41.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the word “baca”
comes from a Hebrew word to “weep.”

00:54:41.494 --> 00:54:45.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that the baca plant
exuded a type of milky sap,

00:54:45.832 --> 00:54:49.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving the appearance of tears,
which added to the gloominess

00:54:49.502 --> 00:54:51.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this parched land.

00:54:51.972 --> 00:54:54.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There may also have been literal tears shed

00:54:54.641 --> 00:54:58.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as ones made their long journey to Jerusalem.

00:54:58.211 --> 00:55:03.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice, notice what this Levite
was able to do

00:55:03.183 --> 00:55:06.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he walked through this valley.

00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:08.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, he says in verse 6:

00:55:08.788 --> 00:55:11.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They make it into a place of springs;

00:55:11.691 --> 00:55:16.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the early rain
clothes it with blessings.”

00:55:16.129 --> 00:55:18.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, this Levite was so focused

00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:22.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the joy that he would have
worshipping at the temple

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:27.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that, as he walked through the dry,
desolate Baca Valley,

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this scenery along the way
looked attractive to him.

00:55:31.945 --> 00:55:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to look at this dried up valley
with eyes of faith

00:55:36.116 --> 00:55:39.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it into a place of water springs.

00:55:39.719 --> 00:55:41.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how was that possible?

00:55:42.722 --> 00:55:45.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s like when a brother once described

00:55:45.859 --> 00:55:49.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his trip to the house of a sister
he was courting.

00:55:49.796 --> 00:55:53.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involved getting on dirty buses,
crowded subways,

00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:56.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walking past dingy apartments.

00:55:56.503 --> 00:56:00.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to him, the whole trip
was a beautiful scene

00:56:00.907 --> 00:56:05.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was taking him to visit her.

00:56:05.078 --> 00:56:08.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, the Levite of Psalm 84

00:56:08.381 --> 00:56:11.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could see past the gloominess around him

00:56:11.184 --> 00:56:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see Jehovah’s blessings ahead.

00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:17.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was energized by thinking

00:56:17.157 --> 00:56:21.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his privilege of actually serving
at Jehovah’s temple

00:56:21.027 --> 00:56:25.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point where even the Baca Valley
was beautiful to him,

00:56:25.832 --> 00:56:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it led to the place

00:56:28.168 --> 00:56:31.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he most wanted to be.

00:56:31.337 --> 00:56:35.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that in focus, notice what happens.

00:56:35.608 --> 00:56:37.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 7:

00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:44.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will walk on from strength to strength;

00:56:44.317 --> 00:56:47.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one appears before God

00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Zion.”

00:56:50.223 --> 00:56:54.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean
—“strength to strength”?

00:56:54.194 --> 00:56:57.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though the Levite may have entered
the valley of tears

00:56:57.163 --> 00:56:59.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weak under the weight of his problems,

00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:03.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love for true worship
fueled every step taken.

00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:08.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew his service would be noticed
by Jehovah,

00:57:08.408 --> 00:57:12.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would bless his whole-souled effort
to serve him.

00:57:12.112 --> 00:57:16.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the initial strength from Jehovah
that he had.

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:21.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he finally arrived at the temple,

00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:24.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy of actually appearing

00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:27.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah God
—that joy—

00:57:27.727 --> 00:57:29.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having his approval and blessing

00:57:29.963 --> 00:57:33.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
empowered him and it energized him

00:57:33.133 --> 00:57:37.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk from the strength
that Jehovah initially gives

00:57:37.103 --> 00:57:40.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to even greater strength.

00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:43.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, it made him
an even stronger person

00:57:43.776 --> 00:57:47.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than he was before beginning the journey.

00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:52.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for you students,

00:57:52.051 --> 00:57:55.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your journey to Gilead
was different from others.

00:57:55.455 --> 00:57:58.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did not take the scenic route.

00:57:58.825 --> 00:58:01.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in Jehovah’s strength,

00:58:01.628 --> 00:58:05.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were able to look
beyond the four walls of quarantine,

00:58:05.298 --> 00:58:07.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond the lockdown,

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond the start of class being postponed.

00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:14.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You looked beyond the dry,
parched ground of the Baca Valley,

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you saw Jehovah’s blessing on his people.

00:58:18.278 --> 00:58:22.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Governing Body gave
faithful and discreet direction

00:58:22.982 --> 00:58:25.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood,
you were right here.

00:58:25.618 --> 00:58:27.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You watched it personally.

00:58:28.955 --> 00:58:33.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So though you may have arrived here
weakened by your personal trials

00:58:33.459 --> 00:58:36.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after walking
through your figurative Baca Valley,

00:58:36.996 --> 00:58:41.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s strength you came out stronger

00:58:41.034 --> 00:58:45.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ready to appear
—to appear before Jehovah God

00:58:45.238 --> 00:58:47.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be trained by his organization.

00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:53.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, it was finally announced

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the school would start in August.

00:58:57.517 --> 00:59:00.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
—I remember the day

00:59:00.486 --> 00:59:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you walked into the classroom
for the first time,

00:59:04.224 --> 00:59:06.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you sat in your seats,

00:59:06.492 --> 00:59:08.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you opened up your student binder.

00:59:08.995 --> 00:59:11.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You put your Bible on the desk,

00:59:11.564 --> 00:59:14.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as you looked up, your eyes revealed,

00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:19.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I made it to my journey.’

00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:23.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And class began, day after day.

00:59:23.042 --> 00:59:26.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is noteworthy that, in Jehovah’s strength,

00:59:26.713 --> 00:59:30.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of you
—not one of you missed a day of class.

00:59:30.683 --> 00:59:32.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is to your credit.

00:59:32.685 --> 00:59:34.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wanted to learn every day.

00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:37.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You took advantage of every opportunity.

00:59:37.357 --> 00:59:40.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for the zeal that you showed.

00:59:41.928 --> 00:59:45.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, remember the lessons from class.

00:59:45.965 --> 00:59:48.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you will.

00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:52.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, also, remember the lesson
from your journey

00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:56.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you take on new assignments in the future.

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:59.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See past the challenges along the way;

00:59:59.479 --> 01:00:03.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see past the disappointments;
see past the tears.

01:00:03.449 --> 01:00:07.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn your Baca Valley into a spring,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will become stronger for it.

01:00:10.623 --> 01:00:14.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do this through prayer.

01:00:14.127 --> 01:00:17.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do this by praying to Jehovah

01:00:17.463 --> 01:00:21.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his spirit and focusing on him.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that the end goal

01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:27.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not the assignment in itself.

01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:32.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The assignment is just a means
to experience your real goal

01:00:32.078 --> 01:00:35.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of having and maintaining Jehovah’s blessing.

01:00:35.682 --> 01:00:38.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you prayerfully keep that in focus,

01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:41.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will completely change your outlook

01:00:41.587 --> 01:00:45.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the challenges in front of you.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The parched land becomes streams of water.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tears of pain become tears of joy.

01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:54.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see Jehovah make you walk on

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:56.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from strength to strength”

01:00:56.669 --> 01:00:59.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from the initial strength Jehovah gives

01:00:59.972 --> 01:01:03.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to becoming an ever stronger servant of his.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:08.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will empower you not only to walk
through the valley of hardships

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:11.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will be that much more ready

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for whatever work lies ahead.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be in a much better position

01:01:16.022 --> 01:01:19.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appear before Jehovah your God

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:21.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy his favor.

01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:25.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in conclusion,

01:01:25.064 --> 01:01:29.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the Baca Valley route
through all your challenges.

01:01:29.802 --> 01:01:31.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a wise saying:

01:01:31.804 --> 01:01:35.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A calm sea never made a good sailor.”

01:01:35.408 --> 01:01:39.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, don’t trade hardships for comfort,

01:01:39.145 --> 01:01:42.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you will feel
a closeness to your heavenly Father

01:01:42.715 --> 01:01:45.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that you
never would have experienced

01:01:45.718 --> 01:01:49.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you hadn’t walked
from “strength to strength”

01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:51.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the valley of Baca.

01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:55.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was so encouraging!

01:01:55.828 --> 01:01:59.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, Parts 2 and 3 of the Gilead graduation

01:01:59.198 --> 01:02:02.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be available on jw.org.

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:07.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you’re eager
to see the presentation in its entirety.

01:02:08.107 --> 01:02:09.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude,

01:02:09.475 --> 01:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s visit Ireland.

01:02:11.944 --> 01:02:14.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The land is known as the Emerald Isle

01:02:14.347 --> 01:02:18.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for its variety of lush green landscapes.

01:02:18.451 --> 01:02:21.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stretches from the Cliffs of Moher

01:02:21.621 --> 01:02:24.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the gentle valleys of Healy Pass

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:27.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Mourne Mountains in the north.

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:32.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The white wool of sheep
spot these grassy hills and valleys,

01:02:32.498 --> 01:02:35.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was a different kind of sheep

01:02:35.368 --> 01:02:39.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brought C. T. Russell in 1891.

01:02:39.205 --> 01:02:43.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the first stop in his tour of Europe.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He traveled here some seven times

01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:47.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over a period of 20 years

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was often met by large crowds.

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:54.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, people are still seeking
truth in Ireland.

01:02:54.053 --> 01:02:55.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They desire to serve Jehovah

01:02:55.822 --> 01:02:57.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their whole heart

01:02:57.757 --> 01:03:00.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find a way to symbolize their dedication

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in line with COVID-19 guidelines.

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:06.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters make efforts

01:03:06.065 --> 01:03:08.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach everyone with the good news,

01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:13.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including those who speak
the traditional Irish language.

01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:16.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out of the millions here,
a relatively small percentage

01:03:16.409 --> 01:03:19.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak Irish as their native tongue.

01:03:19.412 --> 01:03:21.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re usually found
in close-knit communities

01:03:21.814 --> 01:03:24.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that value traditional culture.

01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:29.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the challenges,
local publishers find success preaching.

01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:34.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes our brothers and sisters
in the Castlebar Irish Pregroup,

01:03:34.327 --> 01:03:37.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were excited to have a share
in the global campaign

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in November 2020.

01:03:40.166 --> 01:03:43.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adding to the excitement,
the campaign featured

01:03:43.169 --> 01:03:46.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the very first Irish-language <i>Watchtower.</i>

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since young ones are required
to learn Irish in school,

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:55.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are eager to apply
their language skills in the ministry.

01:03:55.314 --> 01:03:58.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their enthusiasm spurs others on.

01:03:58.117 --> 01:03:59.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters

01:03:59.952 --> 01:04:01.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Castlebar Irish Pregroup

01:04:01.954 --> 01:04:03.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their love and greetings

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:05.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood.

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:09.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:04:09.362 --> 01:04:11.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
