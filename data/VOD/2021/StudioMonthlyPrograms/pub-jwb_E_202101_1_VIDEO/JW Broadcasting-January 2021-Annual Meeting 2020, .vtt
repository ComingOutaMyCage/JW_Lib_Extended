This is JW Broadcasting®

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for January 2021.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:29.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Saturday, October 3,

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society

of Pennsylvania

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:35.685 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
held its annual business meeting

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:37.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
via videoconferencing.

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:42.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In normal times, after we care
for that necessary business,

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we share spiritual encouragement
in a larger meeting.

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:51.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we’re not living in normal times.

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to readjust our plans.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the good news is,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did not cancel
the spiritual portion of the program.

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You likely already enjoyed
Brother Herd’s talk

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:13.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in October about the 2021 yeartext.

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:17.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, we encourage you to do so.

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition, the Governing Body assigned me

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:24.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the chairman
for the 2020 annual meeting,

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll also be the anchor
for this month’s and next month’s

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Broadcasting programs.

00:01:31.574 --> 00:01:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy that in this month’s broadcast,

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see the first part

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that spiritual portion
of the annual meeting.

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It begins with a special musical prelude.

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Annual meetings of the Watch Tower
Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been held for many years

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in fact, since January 1885.

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:45.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have been held in different states
in the United States

00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in 1983, in Britain.

00:12:49.118 --> 00:12:52.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year, 2020, the corporate meeting

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being held by videoconference.

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual program has been recorded

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:00.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the benefit of the brothers
all over the earth.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a historic annual meeting.

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:10.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, we have had
some historic annual meetings.

00:13:10.172 --> 00:13:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:17.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the annual meeting
held on October 2, 1944, in Pittsburgh,

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:19.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the members of the Pennsylvania corporation

00:13:19.648 --> 00:13:23.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adopted six resolutions amending its charter.

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:27.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The charter had provided
that voting shares be issued

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to contributors of funds
to the Society’s work,

00:13:31.594 --> 00:13:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the third amendment
eliminated that provision.

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:40.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, directors of the Society
were to be voted into office

00:13:40.936 --> 00:13:45.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by individuals
who were fully devoted to Jehovah,

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
irrespective of the amount of money
that they contributed

00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:51.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance the Kingdom work.

00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:56.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the historic annual meeting in 1944,

00:13:56.886 --> 00:14:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vital question remained.

00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:03.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the Governing Body
was then closely identified

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:08.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Pennsylvania corporation’s
seven-member board of directors,

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did this mean that the Governing Body

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could never be made up
of more than seven anointed Christians?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moreover, since the directors

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are elected
by the members of the corporation,

00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:28.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were the corporation members electing
members of the Governing Body

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the annual meeting each year?

00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:33.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are the directors and officers

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
of Pennsylvania

00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:40.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the members of the Governing Body

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one and the same, or are they different?

00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These questions were answered years later.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were answered
at the annual meeting held

00:14:50.372 --> 00:14:54.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on October 1, 1971

00:14:54.276 --> 00:14:58.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—another historic annual meeting.

00:14:58.113 --> 00:15:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that occasion, one of the speakers
pointed out

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:04.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the governing body preceded

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
of Pennsylvania

00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by hundreds of years.

00:15:11.627 --> 00:15:15.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, despite some who opposed Jehovah

00:15:15.297 --> 00:15:17.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the earthly part of his organization

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:20.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who claimed there was no governing body
in the first century

00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hence saw no need
for a Governing Body today,

00:15:24.373 --> 00:15:28.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a governing body was formed
at Pentecost of 33 C.E.,

00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:30.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 18 centuries

00:15:30.813 --> 00:15:35.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the Pennsylvania corporation
came into existence.

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:41.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, the governing body
consisted of 12 apostles.

00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its number was enlarged later,

00:15:44.226 --> 00:15:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “the apostles and older men in Jerusalem”
were taking the lead.

00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:52.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice what happened later

00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in the Bible book of Acts

00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:57.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 15.

00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:01.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So other issues had been handled
by the 12 apostles,

00:16:01.677 --> 00:16:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now with this circumcision issue

00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:08.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came up among the congregations,

00:16:08.817 --> 00:16:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what we read here
in verse 2 of Acts 15:

00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:16.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But after quite a bit of dissension
and disputing

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:19.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by Paul and Barnabas with them,

00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:23.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas,
and some of the others

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to go up to the apostles

00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and elders in Jerusalem

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:30.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding this issue.”

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the issue was going to be settled
by the first-century governing body.

00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now it’s larger than the apostles;

00:16:39.048 --> 00:16:43.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it included the elders and the apostles

00:16:43.285 --> 00:16:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jerusalem.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is the benefit

00:16:47.322 --> 00:16:51.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of following the direction
from the governing body in the first century

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, by extension, today?

00:16:54.196 --> 00:16:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that at Acts 16:4, 5,

00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:00.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re carrying the decree there.

00:17:00.903 --> 00:17:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it mentions:
“As they traveled on through the cities,

00:17:03.906 --> 00:17:07.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they would deliver to them for observance

00:17:07.876 --> 00:17:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the decrees that had been decided on

00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:14.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the apostles and the elders
who were in Jerusalem.

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now notice.]

00:17:16.018 --> 00:17:19.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then, indeed, the congregations

00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continued to be made firm in the faith

00:17:21.924 --> 00:17:26.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to increase in number day by day.”

00:17:26.395 --> 00:17:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:17:28.397 --> 00:17:30.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a governing body.

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:33.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have a need for legal entities

00:17:33.702 --> 00:17:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance the Kingdom work
in the first century,

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:41.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they did indeed need a governing body.

00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:46.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as conditions in this world permit,

00:17:46.415 --> 00:17:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body will make use
of legal entities.

00:17:49.752 --> 00:17:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a legal entity is dissolved
by government decree,

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:57.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work will still go on.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even now, in lands
where restrictions are in effect

00:18:00.863 --> 00:18:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no legal entities are used,

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:06.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom message is being proclaimed,

00:18:06.368 --> 00:18:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disciples are being made,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theocracy’s increase continues.

00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:17.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the midst of this pandemic,
the preaching continues.

00:18:17.613 --> 00:18:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many experiences are happening globally.

00:18:20.883 --> 00:18:23.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one I received and confirmed

00:18:23.218 --> 00:18:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from two elders serving at Warwick Bethel,

00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:28.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’ll appreciate.

00:18:28.423 --> 00:18:31.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much is going on
and so many nice experiences.

00:18:31.727 --> 00:18:34.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A health-care system that operates

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dozens of hospitals across the United States,

00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of them were COVID hot spots,

00:18:40.402 --> 00:18:43.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to publish a video interview

00:18:43.438 --> 00:18:48.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
featuring two frontline health-care workers
in one of the hospitals.

00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:52.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it happened that the two nurses
they chose for the interviews

00:18:52.414 --> 00:18:54.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were our brothers.

00:18:54.449 --> 00:18:57.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were asked to supply
pictures of their families.

00:18:57.653 --> 00:19:00.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the pictures had been taken
before the pandemic

00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:04.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of a paradise scene
in one of our Assembly Halls.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the woman coordinating
the video interviews

00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
told the brother
that she recognized that scene.

00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he asked her if she was a Witness.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She replied:
“No, but I studied with the Witnesses,

00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:21.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I know it’s the truth.

00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see how close we are to the end.”

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:29.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother then told her
that she’d be happy to know

00:19:29.218 --> 00:19:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the second nurse
whom she had interviewed the day before

00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:35.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also a Witness.

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:39.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the woman burst into tears.

00:19:39.862 --> 00:19:44.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said it made sense that the two nurses
selected for this interview

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would both be Witnesses.

00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:49.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can see it in your approach

00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:53.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the belief
in something bigger than this.”

00:19:53.308 --> 00:19:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said she planned
to resume her Bible study.

00:19:57.145 --> 00:20:02.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pray for this woman
and all the wonderful experiences happening

00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:05.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the preaching goes on
during this pandemic.

00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:09.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is all happening
because Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plant and water

00:20:11.727 --> 00:20:14.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “God [keeps] making it grow.”

00:20:14.663 --> 00:20:18.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory goes to Jehovah.

00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this meeting, as was pointed out last year

00:20:22.271 --> 00:20:25.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the announcement
about the Ramapo project,

00:20:25.374 --> 00:20:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will learn that the faithful slave
is not slowing down.

00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:33.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have more work to do until Jehovah says

00:20:33.215 --> 00:20:37.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work is finished.

00:20:37.419 --> 00:20:39.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look to the future, we are confident

00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:44.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will care for the spiritual
and material needs of his people.

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:47.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his Son, Jesus Christ,
will continue to provide

00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:50.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heavenly direction and support needed

00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:53.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to complete the Kingdom preaching work.

00:20:53.468 --> 00:20:56.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We therefore beg Jehovah for his spirit

00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:59.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to finish the work he has given us.

00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:04.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While Jehovah’s organization here on earth

00:21:04.813 --> 00:21:09.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is legally established and abides
by governmental requirements

00:21:09.117 --> 00:21:11.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for its business meetings,

00:21:11.153 --> 00:21:15.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this organization is bound by a higher power.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:18.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before he left the earth,
Jesus told his followers:

00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:23.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go . . . make disciples . . . ,
teaching them.”

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:25.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did even more.

00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:28.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus promised
that during the time of the end,

00:21:28.503 --> 00:21:31.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would also receive
“food at the proper time”

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us fulfill that commission.

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:37.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has Jesus kept his promise?

00:21:37.512 --> 00:21:40.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video.

00:21:40.282 --> 00:21:44.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is entitled <i>“Go, . . . Teaching Them.”</i>

00:21:50.792 --> 00:21:53.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone who claims to be a Christian

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has dedicated himself to Jehovah God

00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must not only preach

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:02.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he must be able to teach.

00:22:02.204 --> 00:22:04.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go into the homes of the people

00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teach them what the Bible says.

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:14.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed a book that could be used

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
effectively in conducting Bible studies,

00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:18.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one that would cover

00:22:18.854 --> 00:22:20.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basic doctrines and truths.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:23.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many years ago

00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:25.494 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the Bethel dining room

00:22:25.494 --> 00:22:27.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
after the noon meal,

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:30.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Knorr read off a list
of 15 to 20 brothers’ names

00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:32.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were to report at his office immediately.

00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:34.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were told to write

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:38.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new study book using simple,
everyday language,

00:22:38.006 --> 00:22:40.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as they would present basic Bible truths

00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:41.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to someone at the door.

00:22:41.843 --> 00:22:44.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, within months, that book was written,

00:22:44.546 --> 00:22:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
printed, and released

00:22:47.182 --> 00:22:49.384 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as <i>“Let God Be True.”</i>

00:22:49.384 --> 00:22:51.420 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That book made even

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a new publisher feel confident.

00:22:53.422 --> 00:22:56.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like having
a ‘bombshell’ in our hands,

00:22:56.458 --> 00:23:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capable of blowing to bits
all of the false doctrines.

00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:03.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one house,
I conducted studies in that book

00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 15 years with different people!

00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:08.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, a woman;

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
next, a family;

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:13.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, some young people;

00:23:14.609 --> 00:23:17.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally, another woman
—six people in all

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:21.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got baptized using that book.

00:23:23.085 --> 00:23:25.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, some struggled to finish this

00:23:25.587 --> 00:23:28.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the even more detailed
‘<i>Impossible to Lie </i>’ book

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:30.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make progress.

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the late 1960’s,

00:23:32.227 --> 00:23:34.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a book was needed
that got right to the point.

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:39.835 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They called it the “blue bomb.”

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:41.837 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And it was a game changer

00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:43.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—a game changer.

00:23:43.905 --> 00:23:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was written in a simple, clear,

00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:50.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pointed way so that any sincere reader

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could understand it.

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to deal drugs.

00:23:56.084 --> 00:23:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to change, but I didn’t know how.

00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:02.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, my manager gave me the <i>Truth </i> book.

00:24:02.824 --> 00:24:04.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was immediately convinced

00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:08.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had found the truth
and the real meaning of life.

00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:09.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From then on,

00:24:09.631 --> 00:24:12.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who came looking for drugs

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got a <i>Truth</i>  book instead!

00:24:16.938 --> 00:24:18.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the early 1980’s,

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the field needed something new.

00:24:21.176 --> 00:24:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could a book be produced at the same level
as the <i>Bible Stories</i>  book

00:24:25.147 --> 00:24:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with the information
presented in the <i>Truth</i>  book?

00:24:30.752 --> 00:24:33.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had no Bible studies at all.

00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:35.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, I have three,

00:24:35.357 --> 00:24:37.626 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and a fourth one is ready to start.

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:39.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you!

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:45.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was studying with a man
who had been smoking for 17 years.

00:24:46.334 --> 00:24:48.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he started to read
the <i>Live Forever</i>  book.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That did it.

00:24:50.705 --> 00:24:54.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any book that powerful
shouldn’t go to waste sitting on the shelf.

00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:59.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only a decade later, the world had changed.

00:25:00.382 --> 00:25:03.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some lands, so many wanted to study

00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were put on a waiting list.

00:25:05.153 --> 00:25:07.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other lands faced a different problem.

00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:11.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somehow, we dillydally
with some of our students.

00:25:11.726 --> 00:25:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[It] takes us years
to bring some into the truth,

00:25:14.729 --> 00:25:16.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wonder why.

00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:18.233 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Maybe this book,

00:25:18.233 --> 00:25:20.235 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with its pointed truths,

00:25:20.235 --> 00:25:21.870 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will open their minds

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.705 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their hearts to see.

00:25:23.705 --> 00:25:26.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Live Forever </i> book
helped me to love Jehovah,

00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the <i>Knowledge</i>  book

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to make the decision to serve him.

00:25:33.048 --> 00:25:35.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband studied the <i>Knowledge  </i>book

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while he was working in Poland.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:40.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved it so much that he translated it

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:43.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Mongolian and sent it to us.

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:46.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon we were all baptized.

00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:48.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband then joined

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:50.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the real Mongolian translation team.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we needed a book

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that not only sped up disciple-making

00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:58.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also touched the heart.

00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:08.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This book has an instant appeal

00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:10.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that quickly draws householders

00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:12.120 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
into a conversation.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.723 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some are calling it the Gold Nugget!

00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:18.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was searching for something to fill

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the emptiness
that we both felt in our lives.

00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:24.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was being trained
by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:26:24.432 --> 00:26:28.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said, “Feel free
to read whatever I have in my toolbox.”

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:31.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I opened it,
and immediately a little yellow book,

00:26:31.473 --> 00:26:33.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>What Does the Bible Really Teach?,</i>
caught my eye.

00:26:33.908 --> 00:26:36.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scriptures at the beginning of the book,

00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they touched my heart immediately,

00:26:38.113 --> 00:26:40.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt like,

00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:42.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘These answer all the questions

00:26:42.917 --> 00:26:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been searching for my entire life!’

00:26:52.627 --> 00:26:57.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . publication entitled
<i>What Can the Bible Teach Us?</i>

00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:08.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like having
a ‘bombshell’ in our hands.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really touched the heart,

00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:14.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helped bring many into the truth.

00:27:14.282 --> 00:27:17.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found answers to all my questions

00:27:17.619 --> 00:27:20.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just one book.

00:27:20.021 --> 00:27:24.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This book was sent from God.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best teaching tool

00:27:26.127 --> 00:27:28.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve ever been privileged to use.

00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:32.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought this was the book

00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:34.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the only book—

00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:37.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that there never could be another.

00:27:40.508 --> 00:27:43.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you have used every one

00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:46.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those publications over the years.

00:27:46.047 --> 00:27:50.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like me, you have felt that each one
was a great instrument for its time.

00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:53.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re not stuck in the past.

00:27:53.955 --> 00:27:57.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look to the future.

00:27:57.058 --> 00:28:00.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the future of disciple-making?

00:28:00.962 --> 00:28:04.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as Brother David Splane
delivers the talk

00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:07.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wouldn’t It Be Great . . .?”

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:14.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The yeartext for 2020 was
about the preaching work:

00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:18.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go . . . make disciples . . . ,
baptizing them.”

00:28:18.646 --> 00:28:22.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in harmony with that theme,
the Governing Body directed

00:28:22.517 --> 00:28:25.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a number of study articles
should be prepared

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the study edition
of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:32.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the ministry and particularly
about conducting Bible studies.

00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then at the regional convention this summer,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, almost the entirety of Saturday

00:28:38.566 --> 00:28:40.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was dedicated to the disciple-making work.

00:28:40.735 --> 00:28:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:46.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just want to report Bible studies;

00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:49.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to make disciples.

00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:51.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jesus told us to do:

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:53.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go . . . make disciples . . . ,

00:28:53.848 --> 00:28:56.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baptizing them.”

00:28:56.351 --> 00:29:01.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when it comes to reporting
Bible studies, we’re doing very well.

00:29:02.757 --> 00:29:07.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worldwide, we’re reporting
about ten million Bible studies.

00:29:07.762 --> 00:29:09.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think of it, in many cases,

00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than one person
is sitting in on that study.

00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:16.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it could be
that between 12 and 15 million people

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:19.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are studying the Bible with us.

00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:24.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what about the “make disciples” part of it?

00:29:24.379 --> 00:29:28.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, every year,
between 200 and 300 thousand people

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are baptized.

00:29:30.552 --> 00:29:33.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can see that the “make disciples” part

00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:38.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is lagging behind
the reporting Bible studies part.

00:29:38.426 --> 00:29:43.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this trend has been a concern
of the Governing Body for a number of years.

00:29:43.264 --> 00:29:44.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we wondered,

00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:49.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why is it that so many people
are not taking a stand for the truth?’

00:29:51.573 --> 00:29:54.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can probably think
of a number of reasons yourself.

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:59.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people, for example, are quite happy
to learn what the Bible teaches,

00:29:59.447 --> 00:30:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re not willing
to act on what the Bible teaches.

00:30:03.918 --> 00:30:08.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not willing
to make drastic changes in their life.

00:30:08.089 --> 00:30:11.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may have studied
through a whole book or maybe two,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they haven’t been to a single meeting

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe one, maybe the Memorial once.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they make us think of something

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:27.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah told the Israelites

00:30:27.642 --> 00:30:29.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back in the days of Ezekiel.

00:30:29.844 --> 00:30:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 33,

00:30:33.781 --> 00:30:36.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 32.

00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:40.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was a description
of the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day,

00:30:40.154 --> 00:30:43.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I think you’ll find
that the description fits pretty well

00:30:43.625 --> 00:30:46.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few of our Bible students.

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:49.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel chapter 33 (I’ll give you a moment),

00:30:49.697 --> 00:30:52.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 32:

00:30:54.502 --> 00:30:59.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! You are to them
like a romantic love song,

00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:01.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sung with a beautiful voice

00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:04.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and skillfully played
on a stringed instrument.

00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:06.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[But then notice this.]

00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:09.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will hear your words,

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:13.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but no one will act on them.”

00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:17.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that describe some
of our Bible students?

00:31:17.892 --> 00:31:22.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe the study isn’t regular;
maybe it isn’t consistent.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe the student often cancels

00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:28.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe the publisher often cancels.

00:31:28.536 --> 00:31:30.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if a study isn’t regular,

00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:34.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s pretty hard for the person
to make progress, isn’t it?

00:31:34.242 --> 00:31:38.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in many cases, kindhearted publishers

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:41.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just can’t bring themselves to stop the study

00:31:41.516 --> 00:31:43.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when no progress is being made.

00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:48.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or they may say:
‘If I stop the study, I won’t have a study.

00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:51.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like having a Bible study.’

00:31:53.728 --> 00:31:58.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re talking about progressive
Bible studies, and that’s a challenge.

00:31:58.733 --> 00:32:03.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy to conduct
a progressive Bible study.

00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:05.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many factors to consider.

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:09.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example: ‘How early do I bring in prayer?

00:32:09.577 --> 00:32:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I direct interest
to the organization?

00:32:13.047 --> 00:32:16.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How early should I mention the meetings?

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:21.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do I do if my Bible student
doesn’t show up at the meeting?’

00:32:21.122 --> 00:32:23.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about opposition?

00:32:23.257 --> 00:32:25.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That can be tricky.

00:32:25.293 --> 00:32:28.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring it up too soon,
and you might scare him off.

00:32:28.896 --> 00:32:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait too long, and it may be too late.

00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:34.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the ministry?

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:38.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I encourage my Bible student

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:41.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to share what he is learning with others?

00:32:41.142 --> 00:32:43.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘These are a lot of challenges,

00:32:43.411 --> 00:32:47.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and don’t even mention
helping my Bible student

00:32:47.315 --> 00:32:49.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to break a bad habit like smoking.’

00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:52.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great
if we could get some help

00:32:52.754 --> 00:32:54.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with some of these things?

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s more food for thought:

00:32:57.258 --> 00:32:59.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I make sure that the material

00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:02.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is really touching the student’s heart?

00:33:02.597 --> 00:33:06.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want that student to love Jehovah,
to get to know Jehovah.

00:33:06.868 --> 00:33:10.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want him to have
a warm personal relationship

00:33:10.038 --> 00:33:12.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘with Jehovah so that no one

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—neither the boss nor his relatives
nor his mate nor his neighbor—

00:33:17.845 --> 00:33:22.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be allowed to come
between my student and Jehovah God.’

00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:26.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another thing
for conducting a Bible study:

00:33:26.454 --> 00:33:29.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to focus on the Scriptures.

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:32.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “The seed is the word of God.”

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So, now, how do I draw my student out

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘as to his feelings about this scripture?

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe he understands
what the scripture says,

00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:45.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how does he feel
about what he is learning?’

00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:47.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great

00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:51.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if some of those questions
were prepared for us?

00:33:51.345 --> 00:33:55.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible students also have challenges
in their personal life.

00:33:55.516 --> 00:33:58.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great
if we could bring someone

00:33:58.186 --> 00:34:01.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our study who has gone through
a similar situation as the students?

00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:04.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who understands
what the student is going through?

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:07.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would really take
the pressure off, wouldn’t it?

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:11.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can you evaluate
the progress of the student?

00:34:11.032 --> 00:34:14.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I know if the student
is steadily working

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘toward becoming an unbaptized publisher

00:34:17.538 --> 00:34:20.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then getting baptized?’

00:34:20.374 --> 00:34:22.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another thing:

00:34:22.677 --> 00:34:26.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the reasons why it takes so long
for some to make progress

00:34:26.347 --> 00:34:30.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that there are two books
and a brochure to go through.

00:34:30.518 --> 00:34:32.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a lot of reading.

00:34:32.053 --> 00:34:34.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think of it,
a lot of our students

00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have never opened a book
since they left school.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:39.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for them, this is a big change.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some get baptized
before they’ve covered the second book,

00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:46.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s a pity because they’re losing out

00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:49.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on practical information on Christian living

00:34:49.103 --> 00:34:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they really need to have.

00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:54.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then some of our brothers and sisters

00:34:54.275 --> 00:34:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not even using
the <i>Jehovah’s Will </i> brochure

00:34:57.578 --> 00:35:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to direct interest to the organization.

00:35:00.414 --> 00:35:02.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The <i>Jehovah’s Will</i>  brochure?
What’s that?’

00:35:02.884 --> 00:35:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:35:04.919 --> 00:35:09.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great if in just one book,

00:35:09.624 --> 00:35:13.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could cover all
of the basic doctrinal matters,

00:35:13.094 --> 00:35:15.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the matters about Christian living,

00:35:15.963 --> 00:35:19.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and direct people’s interest
to the organization

00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:21.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in just one book?

00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:24.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That truly would be great.

00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:28.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe right now, you’re saying:
‘All right, I understand.

00:35:28.242 --> 00:35:32.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We do need some help with this,
but what are you doing about it?’

00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you.

00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:38.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In April 2018,
the Service Committee of the Governing Body

00:35:38.586 --> 00:35:41.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surveyed the branches
to find out what teaching methods

00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:45.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were really effective
in bringing people along to baptism.

00:35:45.593 --> 00:35:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to admit that some
of the study material and teaching methods

00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:53.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were used 30 years ago
were great for the time,

00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:57.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they don’t necessarily
meet the needs of people today.

00:35:57.605 --> 00:35:59.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they got some good answers in.

00:35:59.841 --> 00:36:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on the answers,
early in 2019, a team of brothers

00:36:04.812 --> 00:36:08.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there were writers and
there were designers and consultants—

00:36:08.115 --> 00:36:11.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they got together to investigate
whether we could improve

00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:13.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the tools that we’re using.

00:36:13.621 --> 00:36:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they came up
with a new method

00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for conducting studies.

00:36:19.827 --> 00:36:23.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s stop here and be very clear.

00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:27.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We deeply appreciate
all of the study material

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:29.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve had over the years.

00:36:29.036 --> 00:36:31.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s always been great for the times.

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:36.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe like me,
you cut your teeth on <i>“Let God Be True,”</i>

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“<i>This Means Everlasting Life,”</i>

00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:41.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Truth Shall Make You Free,”</i>
—those books were just perfect

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:44.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the period just after World War II.

00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we know that the <i>Live Forever </i> book

00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:49.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a real favorite with many.

00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:54.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it wasn’t the “Study Forever” book;
it was the <i>Live Forever </i> book.

00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some took an awful long time
to complete their study in that book.

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:01.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, we’ve all appreciated

00:37:01.702 --> 00:37:05.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Teach Us </i> book
and the <i>Remain in God’s Love</i>  book<i>.</i>

00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:09.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this material
has been very, very good.

00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:14.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But times change,
and people’s needs change as well.

00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:17.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re living in a visual society,

00:37:17.018 --> 00:37:19.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people learn less

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 by reading than by observing,

00:37:22.256 --> 00:37:25.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by watching, and by discussion.

00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:28.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are we saying?

00:37:28.863 --> 00:37:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready?

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the Governing Body
is happy to announce

00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:40.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a brand new publication
for conducting Bible studies

00:37:40.408 --> 00:37:45.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be made available
in printed form and in electronic form.

00:37:45.446 --> 00:37:47.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know the title?

00:37:47.381 --> 00:37:49.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good one. 

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:51.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:55.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course.</i>

00:38:01.095 --> 00:38:04.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title is taken from Psalm 22:26:

00:38:04.732 --> 00:38:08.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.

00:38:08.602 --> 00:38:12.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you enjoy life forever.”

00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:13.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:15.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a nice text?

00:38:15.643 --> 00:38:18.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was the course put together?

00:38:18.446 --> 00:38:21.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the branches
sent in all of their comments,

00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:23.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were good comments.

00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:26.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the writers got busy,

00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:28.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they analyzed the comments

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:32.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were sent in by the branches.

00:38:32.493 --> 00:38:34.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on the basis of those comments,

00:38:34.628 --> 00:38:37.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three sample lessons were prepared.

00:38:37.465 --> 00:38:42.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the lessons look good on paper,
but would they work in the field?

00:38:42.303 --> 00:38:45.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find out, those lessons were sent

00:38:45.172 --> 00:38:47.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 97 different countries

00:38:47.775 --> 00:38:49.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for field-testing,

00:38:49.844 --> 00:38:53.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the results were very encouraging.

00:38:53.147 --> 00:38:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all 60 lessons in the book

00:38:58.152 --> 00:39:01.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were sent to the field for testing.

00:39:03.524 --> 00:39:07.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the question may come up:
‘Who are the testers?

00:39:07.028 --> 00:39:09.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Did you get all the circuit overseers,

00:39:09.497 --> 00:39:12.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the missionaries,
the special pioneers together

00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:14.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have them test the material?’

00:39:14.468 --> 00:39:16.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there were some of those,

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not all were circuit overseers,

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:22.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not all were missionaries,
or special pioneers.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:27.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a wide variety of brothers
and sisters were used in this test.

00:39:27.314 --> 00:39:29.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some were quite new in the truth,

00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:32.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others had been in the truth
for quite some time.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result is the publication

00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:39.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will soon be made available.

00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:41.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s different about this course?

00:39:41.695 --> 00:39:43.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not going to go into much detail

00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:45.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Brother Jackson
is going to handle that.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here are a couple of points:

00:39:47.935 --> 00:39:50.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, very important,

00:39:50.004 --> 00:39:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the information

00:39:52.706 --> 00:39:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s required to answer the 60 questions

00:39:55.676 --> 00:40:00.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for baptismal candidates
is covered thoroughly in this book.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the information needed

00:40:04.251 --> 00:40:08.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, Bible topics,
Christian living topics,

00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:11.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directing interest to the organization—

00:40:11.358 --> 00:40:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is all thoroughly covered in just one book.

00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do not, repeat,

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:22.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you do not have to study a second book.

00:40:22.536 --> 00:40:24.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the format like?

00:40:24.738 --> 00:40:28.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s somewhat similar
to the midweek <i>Meeting Workbook,</i>

00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:31.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll see that it’s organized in a way

00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:33.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there can be a free discussion

00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:36.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the student and the conductor.

00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in each lesson,
there are just a few introductory paragraphs

00:40:41.455 --> 00:40:44.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student is invited
to read ahead of time.

00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of the lesson will be handled

00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:50.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the conductor and the student.

00:40:50.097 --> 00:40:53.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be a discussion.

00:40:53.134 --> 00:40:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The material will focus on the Scriptures.

00:40:56.604 --> 00:40:59.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A typical sentence might read:

00:40:59.106 --> 00:41:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Read this scripture;
then answer these questions.’

00:41:03.477 --> 00:41:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the questions are provided.

00:41:06.313 --> 00:41:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The electronic copy of the book

00:41:08.983 --> 00:41:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has links to some 200 different videos

00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:15.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can view during the study.

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:19.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the problem
of having somebody along on the study

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has gone through
the same problems as the student has?

00:41:23.164 --> 00:41:24.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Problem solved.

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just look up a video interview
and play that for the student.

00:41:29.803 --> 00:41:34.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt, he will glean
a great deal of benefit from it.

00:41:34.141 --> 00:41:36.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At regular intervals,

00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:39.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tactful reference is made
to sharing the truth with others.

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A typical question,

00:41:41.849 --> 00:41:46.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How would you explain
what you just learned to a friend?’

00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:48.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of every lesson,

00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the student is given a goal
that he can work toward.

00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:56.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that way, it will help him
to evaluate his progress.

00:41:56.096 --> 00:41:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah’s qualities
are showcased throughout the book.

00:41:59.533 --> 00:42:01.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want the student to realize

00:42:01.835 --> 00:42:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah loves him very much

00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:07.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah’s feelings are influenced,

00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:11.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or affected, by the decisions
that the student makes.

00:42:11.645 --> 00:42:14.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that way, he will cultivate a warm,

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:17.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:42:17.818 --> 00:42:22.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we humans
are creatures of habit, aren’t we?

00:42:22.056 --> 00:42:25.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve used the simple
question-and-answer method

00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:28.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many, many years
in conducting Bible studies.

00:42:28.862 --> 00:42:31.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it has met the needs in the past.

00:42:31.565 --> 00:42:33.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in our communication with the branches,

00:42:33.867 --> 00:42:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has become obvious
that something else is needed.

00:42:37.671 --> 00:42:42.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So ask Jehovah to help you
to get used to this new method, and use it.

00:42:42.176 --> 00:42:44.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be glad you did.

00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:48.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pray that Jehovah
will bless our efforts to use this tool.

00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:52.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wouldn’t it be great if when you use it,

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:56.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you not only study with people
but make disciples of them?

00:43:00.394 --> 00:43:03.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane.

00:43:03.264 --> 00:43:06.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an exciting announcement!

00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:08.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Splane asked,

00:43:08.902 --> 00:43:12.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wouldn’t it be great
if you could make a disciple?’

00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:15.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a great thought.

00:43:15.709 --> 00:43:17.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel, though,

00:43:17.711 --> 00:43:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about learning this new way
of conducting Bible studies?

00:43:21.782 --> 00:43:23.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you excited?

00:43:23.884 --> 00:43:28.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you eager to start,
or are you a little uneasy?

00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:33.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson
is going to help you see

00:43:33.093 --> 00:43:38.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you can confidently use
our new book on Bible studies.

00:43:38.098 --> 00:43:40.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His talk is entitled

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:43.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, It Would Be Great, But . . .”

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great?

00:43:48.175 --> 00:43:50.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it would be great.

00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:54.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have a lot of questions, don’t we?

00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:57.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first question is,

00:43:57.151 --> 00:43:59.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did we hear that correctly

00:43:59.186 --> 00:44:02.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that not only are we receiving
a new publication

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:06.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re also starting a new method

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of conducting Bible studies?

00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:11.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is yes.

00:44:11.432 --> 00:44:14.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why is that necessary?

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:17.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to answer that question,

00:44:17.404 --> 00:44:21.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s think of a few things
that have changed in recent years.

00:44:21.842 --> 00:44:26.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, think about
the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:44:26.113 --> 00:44:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the revision
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that revised

00:44:31.352 --> 00:44:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the <i>Reference Bible</i>
was no longer any good?

00:44:34.688 --> 00:44:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:44:36.724 --> 00:44:39.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember the explanation given:

00:44:39.126 --> 00:44:43.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reading skills of people have changed.

00:44:43.797 --> 00:44:47.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No longer do people enjoy reading

00:44:47.234 --> 00:44:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking that slow journey

00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:52.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to eventually get to a destination.

00:44:52.039 --> 00:44:55.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather, in this modern age,
we find that people

00:44:55.709 --> 00:44:59.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are wanting to get
to the destination very quickly.

00:44:59.613 --> 00:45:04.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want clear, simple explanations
that give them the meaning quickly.

00:45:05.486 --> 00:45:08.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if when the Governing Body
were considering

00:45:08.722 --> 00:45:11.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether or not
to revise the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had said, ‘But we can’t do this

00:45:15.262 --> 00:45:19.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because the brothers and sisters
would have to learn a whole lot 

00:45:19.333 --> 00:45:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of new vocabulary
and all their favorite scriptures

00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘they’d have to memorize again

00:45:24.605 --> 00:45:27.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and they probably wouldn’t be able
to find those verses

00:45:27.341 --> 00:45:30.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the right page in the Bible.’

00:45:30.411 --> 00:45:35.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Governing Body didn’t decide that
(not to have the revision).

00:45:35.416 --> 00:45:39.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather, we saw how Jehovah blessed

00:45:39.186 --> 00:45:41.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revision of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:45:41.622 --> 00:45:43.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And haven’t we been happy

00:45:43.857 --> 00:45:47.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using this and getting
the benefits from it?

00:45:47.094 --> 00:45:50.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only have reading skills changed

00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:54.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also learning skills,

00:45:54.501 --> 00:45:57.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s shown by some of the adjustments

00:45:57.204 --> 00:46:00.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been made to our midweek meeting.

00:46:00.274 --> 00:46:05.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we see our midweek meeting
is fast-moving, it’s interesting,

00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:10.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it seems so much easier
to learn things about the Bible.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:13.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, I was talking to a sister

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has been in the truth for about 65 years,

00:46:16.457 --> 00:46:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said concerning the midweek meeting,

00:46:19.493 --> 00:46:22.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have learned more about the Bible

00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:26.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last few years
than in the previous 60 years.”

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t that true?

00:46:29.136 --> 00:46:33.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if the Governing Body
when they were considering this change

00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:36.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had said, ‘Well we can’t make that change

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:40.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the older brothers and sisters
won’t be able to adapt to it.’

00:46:40.747 --> 00:46:44.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we happy that the change was made?

00:46:44.685 --> 00:46:49.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course we are,
because we can see the beautiful benefits

00:46:49.156 --> 00:46:51.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have come from that change.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about all these changes
that have occurred,

00:46:57.264 --> 00:47:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that it fulfills
what Jehovah promised.

00:47:00.701 --> 00:47:04.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you turn with me,
please, to the book of Isaiah

00:47:04.538 --> 00:47:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 60.

00:47:07.207 --> 00:47:10.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s remind ourselves of what is said

00:47:10.544 --> 00:47:13.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the beginning of verse 17.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Jehovah promises:

00:47:15.682 --> 00:47:19.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,

00:47:19.686 --> 00:47:23.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instead of the iron
I will bring in silver,

00:47:23.457 --> 00:47:26.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“instead of the wood, copper,

00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:29.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and instead of the stones, iron.”

00:47:29.296 --> 00:47:32.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t this nicely describe the promise

00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:36.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has made to help us
to keep improving

00:47:36.904 --> 00:47:40.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the various things that we’re doing
with preaching the good news

00:47:40.073 --> 00:47:42.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also our spiritual feeding programs?

00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, things continue to improve.

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s also remember how verse 16
in the same chapter starts.

00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:53.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:47:53.153 --> 00:47:57.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you will actually drink
the milk of nations.”

00:47:57.224 --> 00:48:00.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We probably remember that <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:03.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped us to understand
that this ‘milk of the nations’

00:48:03.931 --> 00:48:06.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves all the things
that are being developed,

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:08.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including modern technology.

00:48:08.735 --> 00:48:11.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah’s people with Jehovah’s blessing

00:48:11.672 --> 00:48:14.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have used many of these modern things

00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:18.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us with teaching and preaching.

00:48:18.478 --> 00:48:22.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as Brother Splane said very accurately,

00:48:22.683 --> 00:48:27.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Times change, and people’s needs change.”

00:48:27.354 --> 00:48:29.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s very true.

00:48:29.523 --> 00:48:32.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve seen,
reading skills have changed

00:48:32.859 --> 00:48:35.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learning skills have too.

00:48:35.629 --> 00:48:39.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for that reason, over the last few years,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible study tools have changed slightly.

00:48:43.437 --> 00:48:48.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen how they’ve become
simpler and easier to use,

00:48:48.008 --> 00:48:53.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of us are using videos
along with these publications.

00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:56.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course,
sometimes it gets a little complicated

00:48:56.016 --> 00:49:00.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re not quite sure
what video to show when.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How refreshing it was
when we saw that the digital version

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:08.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Good News </i> brochure
had videos embedded in it!

00:49:08.729 --> 00:49:13.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re able to tap on the video
and have the right video at the right time

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re conducting a study.

00:49:15.335 --> 00:49:19.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this new publication
takes all of this experience

00:49:19.006 --> 00:49:23.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve gained from trying
to enhance our Bible study tools,

00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:28.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we have something
that will be very easy to use.

00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does the publication look like?

00:49:32.919 --> 00:49:37.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Splane mentioned
that it had been field-tested.

00:49:37.324 --> 00:49:39.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have already used it

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what did they say
about this new publication?

00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:46.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does the Governing Body feel
about this new publication?

00:49:46.566 --> 00:49:50.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All those questions
are answered in this video.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always given us

00:49:55.676 --> 00:49:58.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right tool at the right time

00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach others.

00:50:01.381 --> 00:50:04.551 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And this new book is no exception.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is this book organized?

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:16.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each lesson is divided into three parts.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?

00:50:20.567 --> 00:50:22.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might encourage your student

00:50:22.569 --> 00:50:24.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the first part of a lesson in advance

00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:27.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to note the questions in bold

00:50:27.374 --> 00:50:29.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the key scriptures.

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Begin each study by reading and discussing

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first part together.

00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:38.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, consider together

00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “Dig Deeper” section.

00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:43.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Begin by reading the introductory statement,

00:50:43.824 --> 00:50:45.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which explains what follows,

00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:48.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note of the subheadings

00:50:48.095 --> 00:50:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that outline the main points.

00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:53.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the scriptures,

00:50:53.333 --> 00:50:55.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watch the provided videos together,

00:50:55.802 --> 00:50:57.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then discuss how

00:50:57.804 --> 00:50:59.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scriptures and videos

00:50:59.439 --> 00:51:01.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answer the related questions.

00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discuss the artwork with the student.

00:51:06.446 --> 00:51:08.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then follow with the questions

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:10.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found in the “Some People Say” section.

00:51:12.352 --> 00:51:14.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, read the “Summary”

00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:17.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discuss the “Review” questions.

00:51:17.924 --> 00:51:19.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your student can enter the date

00:51:19.926 --> 00:51:22.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lesson was completed.

00:51:22.129 --> 00:51:24.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each lesson 

00:51:24.131 --> 00:51:26.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides a “Goal” for the student,

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the “Explore” section

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:29.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offers additional content

00:51:29.936 --> 00:51:31.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be useful depending

00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:33.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your student’s needs and interests.

00:51:34.808 --> 00:51:37.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this tool is very different.

00:51:37.944 --> 00:51:39.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was it designed this way?

00:51:39.946 --> 00:51:41.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a lot like

00:51:41.948 --> 00:51:44.351 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the teaching used in our theocratic schools.

00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:46.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is very interactive.

00:51:46.553 --> 00:51:48.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On the one hand,

00:51:48.488 --> 00:51:50.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lessons are written in such a way

00:51:50.657 --> 00:51:54.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really make the student
think about what he is learning.

00:51:55.128 --> 00:51:57.430 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This tool has the ability

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.066 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to involve the Bible student.

00:52:00.066 --> 00:52:02.002 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It shows them a video,

00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:04.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they have references
they can look at.

00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:08.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way that it’s designed involves them.

00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:12.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really going to give them
a good foundation.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, the teacher can use
the viewpoint questions

00:52:17.484 --> 00:52:21.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw out how the student really feels

00:52:21.454 --> 00:52:23.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what he’s learning from God’s Word.

00:52:24.758 --> 00:52:25.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the most thoroughly

00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:27.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
field-tested publication

00:52:27.627 --> 00:52:29.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we have ever produced.

00:52:29.629 --> 00:52:31.631 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
From writing the text

00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:33.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to simplifying the text

00:52:33.633 --> 00:52:35.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—polishing it, getting it ready—

00:52:35.802 --> 00:52:38.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has been produced
so that it can be translated

00:52:38.705 --> 00:52:40.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into many languages

00:52:40.707 --> 00:52:43.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to help people everywhere.

00:52:43.677 --> 00:52:47.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this tool is very different,

00:52:47.047 --> 00:52:49.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but is it effective?

00:52:50.116 --> 00:52:52.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands

00:52:52.452 --> 00:52:54.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tested the lessons.

00:52:54.454 --> 00:52:56.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do they say about it?

00:52:56.723 --> 00:52:58.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I love the new layout.

00:52:58.725 --> 00:53:01.494 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s current, and it’s intuitive.

00:53:01.494 --> 00:53:04.297 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the way the Bible truths are presented

00:53:04.297 --> 00:53:07.367 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—it’s very logical and easy to understand.

00:53:07.367 --> 00:53:09.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s going to be a game changer.

00:53:10.303 --> 00:53:12.839 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The “Dig Deeper” section is amazing.

00:53:12.839 --> 00:53:14.841 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It ensures that the teaching

00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:17.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
comes directly from the Bible.

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.212 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because this part of the study

00:53:19.212 --> 00:53:21.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
becomes a conversation,

00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:23.416 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the students answer right from their hearts,

00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which allows me to learn a lot more

00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:27.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about how they think and feel.

00:53:28.188 --> 00:53:30.190 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The new method really helps us

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.926 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to convince the mind and reach the heart.

00:53:32.926 --> 00:53:34.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Most of all, it helps

00:53:34.761 --> 00:53:36.396 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both the teacher and the student

00:53:36.396 --> 00:53:38.064 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to focus on the Scriptures

00:53:38.064 --> 00:53:40.066 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
rather than on the study aid.

00:53:40.066 --> 00:53:42.068 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We never heard anybody say

00:53:42.068 --> 00:53:43.503 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“the paragraph says”

00:53:43.503 --> 00:53:45.505 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because when they did answer the question,

00:53:45.505 --> 00:53:46.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they were expressing what

00:53:46.606 --> 00:53:48.608 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they really believed.

00:53:50.076 --> 00:53:53.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The lessons are both logical and concise.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.016 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The method is highly interactive.

00:53:57.183 --> 00:53:59.185 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The students not only respond

00:53:59.185 --> 00:54:00.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in their own words

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.855 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but are also able to come

00:54:01.855 --> 00:54:03.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the correct conclusions

00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:04.758 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all by themselves.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.596 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It helps me as the teacher to talk less,

00:54:09.596 --> 00:54:11.298 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it helps the student

00:54:11.298 --> 00:54:13.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to express himself and to think.

00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.436 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the videos elicited comments

00:54:16.436 --> 00:54:18.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(sometimes of even a personal nature)

00:54:18.305 --> 00:54:19.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that probably never would’ve come out

00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:21.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had it not been for the videos.

00:54:21.975 --> 00:54:23.810 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The aim is to get to know Jehovah,

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.378 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah,

00:54:25.378 --> 00:54:27.047 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to learn what his will is for us

00:54:27.047 --> 00:54:28.548 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and to do that will,

00:54:28.548 --> 00:54:31.051 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and also to draw close to his organization.

00:54:32.886 --> 00:54:34.888 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have been in full-time service

00:54:34.888 --> 00:54:36.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for over 50 years.

00:54:36.923 --> 00:54:39.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I conduct several Bible studies.

00:54:39.793 --> 00:54:43.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
These lessons cannot be compared with others.

00:54:43.163 --> 00:54:45.465 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They are more effective and just what

00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:47.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we need for our times.

00:54:50.403 --> 00:54:52.772 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It equips them to explain to others

00:54:52.772 --> 00:54:54.774 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what they have learned.

00:54:54.774 --> 00:54:56.843 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And as a teacher,

00:54:56.843 --> 00:54:59.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that fills me with so much joy

00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:01.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I am motivated to be zealous

00:55:01.781 --> 00:55:04.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and find more new Bible studies.

00:55:05.418 --> 00:55:07.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are so excited about this new approach

00:55:07.587 --> 00:55:09.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to teaching Bible truths!

00:55:09.422 --> 00:55:11.024 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The main points stand out,

00:55:11.024 --> 00:55:12.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the application is clear,

00:55:12.659 --> 00:55:14.494 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s easy to remember.

00:55:14.494 --> 00:55:16.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And everybody can benefit from it

00:55:16.329 --> 00:55:18.164 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—from those with little or no education

00:55:18.164 --> 00:55:20.100 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to those who are highly educated.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.701 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our students are going to love

00:55:21.701 --> 00:55:23.036 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this new publication.

00:55:23.036 --> 00:55:25.038 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And we will too, as this will make us

00:55:25.038 --> 00:55:26.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
better teachers of God’s Word

00:55:26.806 --> 00:55:28.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so as to make more disciples

00:55:28.641 --> 00:55:30.443 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
before the end comes.

00:55:30.443 --> 00:55:32.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do members of the Governing Body

00:55:32.445 --> 00:55:34.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel about this innovative approach?

00:55:36.616 --> 00:55:39.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This book has the potential
to draw many honesthearted ones

00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:41.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Jehovah’s organization

00:55:41.788 --> 00:55:44.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve alongside us in pure worship

00:55:44.457 --> 00:55:47.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.

00:55:47.994 --> 00:55:51.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compared to all the Bible study tools
we’ve used in the past,

00:55:51.664 --> 00:55:53.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is gold.

00:55:53.967 --> 00:55:56.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what it’s all about
—helping that student

00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:59.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:55:59.406 --> 00:56:01.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And unquestionably,

00:56:01.541 --> 00:56:05.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this new publication,
this marvelous gift from Jehovah,

00:56:05.512 --> 00:56:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us accomplish this worthy goal.

00:56:11.184 --> 00:56:15.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We humbly recognize
that whatever tool we use,

00:56:15.321 --> 00:56:17.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only Jehovah can make it grow.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:22.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re praying that Jehovah
will grant success to this new tool

00:56:22.395 --> 00:56:26.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build and make disciples of Christ.

00:56:26.699 --> 00:56:29.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not just preachers.

00:56:29.736 --> 00:56:32.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are teachers.

00:56:32.205 --> 00:56:35.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are disciple-makers.

00:56:35.241 --> 00:56:38.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This new book gives us what we need

00:56:38.244 --> 00:56:40.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others love Jehovah,

00:56:40.213 --> 00:56:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
follow Christ,

00:56:42.182 --> 00:56:44.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get baptized,

00:56:44.551 --> 00:56:48.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:56:51.524 --> 00:56:55.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a fantastic new publication!

00:56:55.061 --> 00:56:58.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure all of us
are looking forward to using it.

00:56:58.531 --> 00:57:01.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you may be thinking:

00:57:01.734 --> 00:57:05.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How big is it?
How many pages are there?’

00:57:05.371 --> 00:57:09.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are 256 pages,

00:57:09.442 --> 00:57:12.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are 60 lessons.

00:57:12.479 --> 00:57:15.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you may be thinking:

00:57:15.048 --> 00:57:18.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will that be overwhelming to many people

00:57:18.218 --> 00:57:21.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when we show them this new publication?

00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:25.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Many of our Bible studies that we start

00:57:25.592 --> 00:57:30.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘do lessons 1 and 2, and then by 3,
perhaps they stop studying.

00:57:30.597 --> 00:57:33.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So if we’re using a large publication,

00:57:33.433 --> 00:57:36.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘could it be that it would be
a waste of a publication

‘if someone isn’t going to continue to study?

00:57:40.173 --> 00:57:44.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wouldn’t it be great
if we also had something else

00:57:44.244 --> 00:57:47.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would introduce this new study system?’

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly
what we’re happy to announce:

00:57:51.184 --> 00:57:54.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the release of a new brochure entitled

00:57:54.287 --> 00:57:59.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever</i>
<i>—Introductory Bible Lessons.</i>

00:57:59.292 --> 00:58:03.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this new brochure contains within it

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:08.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first three lessons
of the new publication.

00:58:08.535 --> 00:58:11.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at the back of this brochure,

00:58:11.804 --> 00:58:16.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice that it’s designed similarly
to the design of our tracts.

00:58:16.809 --> 00:58:21.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has the questions:
“Is it possible to enjoy life forever?

00:58:21.548 --> 00:58:26.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say yes? no? maybe?”

00:58:26.286 --> 00:58:29.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The explanation that’s given below,

00:58:29.022 --> 00:58:31.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the scriptures, helps us then

00:58:31.558 --> 00:58:35.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to direct the attention
to the first lesson in the brochure.

00:58:35.628 --> 00:58:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this first lesson
is entitled “How Can the Bible Help You?,”

00:58:40.633 --> 00:58:44.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second lesson is “The Bible Gives Hope,”

00:58:44.537 --> 00:58:48.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the third lesson,
“Can You Trust the Bible?”

00:58:49.909 --> 00:58:54.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful way
to introduce this new publication!

00:58:54.581 --> 00:58:58.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once we’ve gone through the brochure
and finished the three lessons,

00:58:58.251 --> 00:59:01.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if someone shows
that they really want to continue

00:59:01.321 --> 00:59:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their Bible study,
then we introduce them

00:59:04.224 --> 00:59:09.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the larger publication
and start at lesson 4.

00:59:09.028 --> 00:59:11.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That’s so exciting, isn’t it?

00:59:11.731 --> 00:59:14.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be very easy to use this

00:59:14.067 --> 00:59:17.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to use the electronic version,

00:59:17.036 --> 00:59:21.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has been developed
at the same time as the printed version.

00:59:21.107 --> 00:59:23.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the electronic version in <i>JW Library</i>®,

00:59:23.943 --> 00:59:28.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to just tap the link
and it will take you to the videos

00:59:28.081 --> 00:59:32.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to the verses
or to the reference material.

00:59:32.051 --> 00:59:34.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that exciting?

00:59:34.554 --> 00:59:39.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure all of us are looking forward
to being able to use this new brochure

00:59:39.525 --> 00:59:43.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the new publication
to start Bible studies.

00:59:43.363 --> 00:59:45.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s still one question left,

00:59:45.965 --> 00:59:50.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great
if we can use these publications

00:59:50.236 --> 00:59:53.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help other persons to become disciples,

00:59:53.306 --> 00:59:56.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, and to enjoy life forever?

00:59:59.279 --> 01:00:02.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that will be great, Brother Jackson!

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:04.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

01:00:04.751 --> 01:00:08.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is exciting to have
such an innovative new tool

01:00:08.488 --> 01:00:10.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conduct Bible studies.

01:00:10.623 --> 01:00:15.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That first exposure
to the introductory study brochure

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:17.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was very helpful.

01:00:17.096 --> 01:00:19.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you might be thinking:

01:00:19.165 --> 01:00:21.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The video was presented so fast;

01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:24.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘it’s a blur in my mind.

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:27.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m not sure if I understand
all of the features

01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:30.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how the study is to progress.’

01:00:30.476 --> 01:00:32.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, take heart.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:37.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, you can watch
that video over and over again

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’d like.

01:00:39.619 --> 01:00:43.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But also, please know that more information

01:00:43.122 --> 01:00:45.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be coming to help you assimilate

01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:49.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these new teaching techniques in the future.

01:00:51.264 --> 01:00:53.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is next on our program?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the past few years,
our annual meeting program has presented

01:00:58.805 --> 01:01:02.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a longer-than-usual animated edition

01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:04.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend.</i>

01:01:04.777 --> 01:01:07.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is always special.

01:01:07.513 --> 01:01:10.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year is no exception.

01:01:10.883 --> 01:01:13.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pleased to present to you young ones

01:01:13.553 --> 01:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you who are still young at heart

01:01:16.055 --> 01:01:20.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new epic edition,
entitled <i>Jehovah Forgives.</i>

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:23.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the presentation.

01:01:35.908 --> 01:01:39.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jesus’ last night with his apostles.

01:01:41.013 --> 01:01:44.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are the ones
who have stuck with me in my trials.

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:49.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, Jesus would be arrested.

01:01:49.222 --> 01:01:52.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was going to be very hard for them.

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:57.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you will be stumbled
in connection with me on this night,

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for it is written:
“I will strike the shepherd,

01:01:59.999 --> 01:02:03.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sheep of the flock
will be scattered about.”

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:07.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were going to run away
and abandon Jesus.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter said:

01:02:09.709 --> 01:02:13.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although all the others
are stumbled in connection with you,—

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:15.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“I will never be stumbled!”

01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:17.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good, Caleb!

01:02:17.784 --> 01:02:22.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter thought he was strong
and would never make Jehovah sad.

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:27.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tell you, Peter,
a rooster will not crow today

01:02:27.527 --> 01:02:31.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you have denied knowing me three times.

01:02:32.632 --> 01:02:34.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cock-a-roo!

01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:36.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s cock-a-doodle-doo!

01:02:36.536 --> 01:02:38.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nuh-uh.
That’s not a rooster!

01:02:38.438 --> 01:02:39.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, kids!

01:02:39.439 --> 01:02:42.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not important how the rooster sounds.

01:02:42.875 --> 01:02:45.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never make Jehovah sad!

01:02:45.778 --> 01:02:47.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me neither!

01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:49.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you’d never want to.

01:02:49.482 --> 01:02:52.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus knew Peter would be afraid.

01:02:52.485 --> 01:02:54.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you are afraid . . .

01:02:55.488 --> 01:02:57.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!
You’re late!

01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry!
Grab your bags!

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Careful!

01:03:05.565 --> 01:03:07.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love you kids!
See you later!

01:03:07.834 --> 01:03:08.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be good!

01:03:08.668 --> 01:03:10.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!

01:03:44.203 --> 01:03:45.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m home!

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, hello!

01:03:51.143 --> 01:03:53.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anybody?

01:03:55.348 --> 01:03:58.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a rough day.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aww, what happened?

01:04:07.527 --> 01:04:11.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, are you OK?

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:15.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if Jehovah doesn’t wanna be
my Friend anymore?

01:04:16.769 --> 01:04:18.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

01:04:19.372 --> 01:04:21.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants to be your Friend.

01:04:21.974 --> 01:04:26.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you did something bad,
he wants you to tell.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:29.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

01:04:29.916 --> 01:04:34.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So today at school,
I was outside on the playground.

01:05:15.127 --> 01:05:16.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Caleb.

01:05:18.097 --> 01:05:19.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I was just, uh . . .

01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:24.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can have it.

01:05:24.036 --> 01:05:25.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

01:05:25.104 --> 01:05:27.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought he can’t have it.

01:05:27.406 --> 01:05:29.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!
Which is it?

01:05:29.208 --> 01:05:33.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I didn’t want it anyway.

01:05:33.646 --> 01:05:36.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I thought the Bible says you can’t?

01:05:36.749 --> 01:05:38.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, it says . . .

01:05:38.751 --> 01:05:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
C’mon!
What does it say?

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:42.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I’m not sure.

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you came to my house the other day
to talk about the Bible.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you remember?

01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:50.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, yeah.

01:05:50.997 --> 01:05:53.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that wasn’t me.

01:05:57.570 --> 01:05:59.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, ha-ha.

01:06:02.074 --> 01:06:03.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Huh!

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was you, but you’re scared.

Hi, Honey.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I can’t talk right now.

01:06:17.323 --> 01:06:19.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you give me a call back later?

01:06:24.764 --> 01:06:27.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a rough day.

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:33.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when Peter said
he would never stumble?

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:36.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later that night,

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:38.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was arrested.

01:06:40.179 --> 01:06:42.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move it!

01:06:53.025 --> 01:06:56.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter loved him and wanted to help.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:14.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But doing the right thing isn’t always easy.

01:07:21.887 --> 01:07:24.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too were with Jesus the Galilean!

Wait!

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:40.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of them!

you follow Jesus!

But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like at school.

01:09:12.932 --> 01:09:15.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:09:15.034 --> 01:09:18.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter didn’t want to make that mistake
ever again.

01:09:20.005 --> 01:09:24.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he wondered if Jesus and Jehovah
would still be his friends.

01:09:41.694 --> 01:09:45.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Jesus was resurrected,
he talked to Peter.

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:53.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Lord,

01:09:53.305 --> 01:09:56.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know I have affection for you.

01:09:57.309 --> 01:09:59.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus forgave him!

01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:01.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so did Jehovah.

01:10:02.348 --> 01:10:05.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter had to talk to Jesus.

01:10:05.484 --> 01:10:10.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you upset Jehovah,
what do you think you have to do?

01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:12.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to Jehovah.

01:10:12.191 --> 01:10:14.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

01:10:14.193 --> 01:10:17.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to pray to ask for forgiveness.

01:10:18.364 --> 01:10:20.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus showed Peter that he was forgiven

01:10:20.866 --> 01:10:23.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving him more work to do.

01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:26.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shepherd my little sheep.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:38.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why didn’t Peter give up
when he made a mistake?

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:40.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah forgives.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, guys!

01:10:51.397 --> 01:10:53.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, wait!

01:10:53.432 --> 01:10:55.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m gonna need to explain birthdays.

01:10:55.567 --> 01:10:57.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you help me?

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

01:11:00.873 --> 01:11:04.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a masterful application

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:08.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Bible example
about Jehovah’s forgiveness.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb got the point, and so did all of us.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice at the very end

01:11:16.388 --> 01:11:21.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Caleb asked his father
to help him explain our stand on birthdays?

01:11:22.394 --> 01:11:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please look forward
to an upcoming Video on Demand segment

01:11:26.665 --> 01:11:30.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where his father does just that.

01:11:30.002 --> 01:11:32.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by the way,

01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:35.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are making a poster available online.

01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:45.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll be happy to know
that posters will be made available

01:11:45.084 --> 01:11:47.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the other epic animation videos

01:11:47.486 --> 01:11:51.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  series.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pandemic in 2020

01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:59.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changed the way we carried out true worship.

01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:03.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Memorial last year
was experienced in private homes,

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:05.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our preaching methods were changed,

01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:07.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our regional conventions

01:12:07.706 --> 01:12:11.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were transformed into prerecorded sessions.

01:12:11.643 --> 01:12:16.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we were all cared for spiritually.

01:12:16.215 --> 01:12:19.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was involved in making this all happen

01:12:19.184 --> 01:12:21.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so quickly and effectively?

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:25.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch our next video.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty-twenty was a year
of unprecedented change.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The coronavirus pandemic

01:12:37.803 --> 01:12:40.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has taken a grim toll around the world.

01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:43.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some parts of the world,
the coronavirus is . . .

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:46.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning to spread more quickly.

01:12:49.014 --> 01:12:53.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This global pandemic has thrown the world

01:12:53.519 --> 01:12:56.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a state of uncertainty.

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:01.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On a global scale, it was unlike anything

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people
had yet experienced in the 21st century.

01:13:06.665 --> 01:13:09.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyday life for many of us

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:14.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been disrupted in ways
we might never have imagined.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:21.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve made dramatic adjustments
to our activities all over the world.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:25.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn how to use new apps like Skype®

01:13:25.684 --> 01:13:27.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zoom—what’s that?

01:13:28.887 --> 01:13:31.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It changed how we attended meetings,

01:13:31.423 --> 01:13:34.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
engaged in the ministry,
and visited with friends.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some of us,

01:13:36.528 --> 01:13:39.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this may have been
the very first time we ever held

01:13:39.064 --> 01:13:41.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Memorial in our home.

01:13:42.234 --> 01:13:45.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And although attending in smaller groups
may have been even closer

01:13:45.938 --> 01:13:48.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how the Memorial
was observed in earlier times,

01:13:49.741 --> 01:13:52.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for most modern-day servants of Jehovah,

01:13:52.778 --> 01:13:56.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was likely a unique experience.

01:13:59.218 --> 01:14:01.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, during the summer,

01:14:01.587 --> 01:14:04.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we enjoyed a full convention program,

01:14:04.756 --> 01:14:05.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with talks delivered directly

01:14:05.991 --> 01:14:07.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Governing Body members

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their helpers,

01:14:09.561 --> 01:14:10.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in most cases,

01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:15.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, streamed right into our homes.

01:14:20.139 --> 01:14:22.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, despite the various challenges

01:14:22.141 --> 01:14:25.277 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and difficulties experienced in 2020,

01:14:25.277 --> 01:14:28.547 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization continued undaunted

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:31.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing the right food at the right time.

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:34.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why was this convention

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:38.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unlike any other
in our organization’s history?

01:14:38.323 --> 01:14:40.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were the challenges?

01:14:40.626 --> 01:14:44.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most important,
what have been the benefits?

01:14:47.766 --> 01:14:50.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On March 11, 2020,

01:14:50.502 --> 01:14:52.237 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the World Health Organization

01:14:52.237 --> 01:14:53.739 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made the assessment

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.141 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that COVID-19 could be characterized

01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:57.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a pandemic.

01:14:57.643 --> 01:15:00.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At that point, we had no idea

01:15:00.112 --> 01:15:01.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as to what governments

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.981 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were going to do worldwide.

01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:04.850 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Would they allow our brothers

01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:06.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet in Kingdom Halls?

01:15:06.852 --> 01:15:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would they allow our brothers
to meet in larger venues?

01:15:10.489 --> 01:15:12.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had no idea whatsoever.

01:15:13.192 --> 01:15:16.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body
approved a letter to all branches

01:15:16.195 --> 01:15:19.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
canceling all live conventions worldwide.

01:15:19.831 --> 01:15:23.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the idea was
for us to prerecord a program

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:27.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be used in any location

01:15:27.039 --> 01:15:30.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world
so that they would at least have

01:15:30.309 --> 01:15:33.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the program of the regional convention.

01:15:33.312 --> 01:15:34.880 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to ensure

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.882 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that this spiritual food got out there

01:15:36.882 --> 01:15:39.284 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to all of our dear brothers and sisters.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:42.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important,
we wanted to make certain

01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:46.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this program went forward,
because it honors Jehovah.

01:15:46.225 --> 01:15:49.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the Source of the joy that we have.

01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:53.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, very quickly, speakers were
each assigned two convention parts.

01:15:53.232 --> 01:15:54.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to prepare them,

01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:56.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was scheduled to have all these talks

01:15:56.835 --> 01:15:59.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded during the last two weeks of April.

01:15:59.871 --> 01:16:02.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving a talk at an open arena

01:16:02.574 --> 01:16:04.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at a large event,

01:16:04.743 --> 01:16:07.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have the opportunity of getting

01:16:07.212 --> 01:16:09.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feedback from the audience.

01:16:09.514 --> 01:16:12.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you say something
that impresses the audience

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:15.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or makes them happy,
seeing the smiling faces there,

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:18.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somehow that really stirs up our presentation

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps us to make it
more lively and meaningful.

01:16:22.694 --> 01:16:26.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But being in the basement
of the office building,

01:16:26.398 --> 01:16:30.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking at a camera
with nobody else in the room,

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:32.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that it’s just a couple of persons

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:36.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recording it in another room certainly is

01:16:36.508 --> 01:16:39.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very different way to present a talk.

01:16:39.611 --> 01:16:44.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has allowed us
to endure this time of pandemic,

01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:49.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also had to know
—and we’re convinced he knew—

01:16:49.454 --> 01:16:54.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could still make
this “Always Rejoice”! program happen

01:16:54.293 --> 01:16:58.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we would use the tools
available to us, and he would help us.

01:16:58.797 --> 01:17:00.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly what we did.

01:17:06.738 --> 01:17:09.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s take a closer look
at some additional challenges faced

01:17:09.808 --> 01:17:12.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once the talks were recorded.

01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:15.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had the opportunity to hear
from some of the departments involved.

01:17:17.316 --> 01:17:19.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

01:17:19.318 --> 01:17:22.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did the team adapt to the challenges?

01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:26.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the reaction, initially,
was that we were very excited.

01:17:26.224 --> 01:17:28.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to try new things,

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:29.895 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and this was a huge opportunity

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.396 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to do just that.

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.398 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But then as we had more meetings about it,

01:17:33.398 --> 01:17:35.133 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we found out what was going to be involved.

01:17:35.133 --> 01:17:37.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We suddenly got very nervous

01:17:37.436 --> 01:17:39.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we found out
about all the translation

01:17:39.438 --> 01:17:41.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how soon everything had to be finished.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What impact did that have?

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:46.345 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services had never produced

01:17:46.345 --> 01:17:48.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
an online program of this size before.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’re talking

01:17:49.781 --> 01:17:53.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an 18-hour online regional convention
that had to be produced

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very short time.

01:17:54.686 --> 01:17:55.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most years,

01:17:55.987 --> 01:17:57.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we just translate the outlines,

01:17:57.522 --> 01:17:58.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are relatively easy,

01:17:58.824 --> 01:18:00.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then we translate

01:18:00.525 --> 01:18:03.328 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all the convention videos and dramas.

01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:04.596 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But this year,

01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:08.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the translators not only had to do
that work of translating the videos

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:13.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they had to translate
the scripts for each talk and then arrange

01:18:13.839 --> 01:18:16.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for recording all of those talks.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:18.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a tremendous amount of work.

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:20.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us were saying:

01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:21.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can we postpone it?

01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:22.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can we ask

01:18:22.814 --> 01:18:24.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“to write back and say,

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:26.618 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Brothers, please, can we do it later?’”

01:18:27.219 --> 01:18:28.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because we just thought

01:18:28.286 --> 01:18:30.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was impossible to do.

01:18:31.223 --> 01:18:33.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The government in India

01:18:33.325 --> 01:18:35.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had announced a complete lockdown,

01:18:35.327 --> 01:18:36.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so overnight

01:18:37.329 --> 01:18:39.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were without our offices,

01:18:39.331 --> 01:18:41.333 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our computer equipment,

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our recording studios,

01:18:43.335 --> 01:18:46.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the level of connectivity we enjoyed.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:50.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt like a carpenter
who’s asked to produce furniture

01:18:52.043 --> 01:18:56.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but has no access
to his toolbox or his workshop.

01:18:57.516 --> 01:19:00.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a lot to contend with.

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:03.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some unique solutions

01:19:03.855 --> 01:19:07.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the teams came up with
to meet those various challenges?

01:19:07.592 --> 01:19:10.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there were amazing solutions.

01:19:10.695 --> 01:19:12.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that impressed me

01:19:12.764 --> 01:19:17.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the recording studios that were made.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normally the translators go into the RTO

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:26.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the branch to do the recording,

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:31.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now they had to make
hundreds of makeshift studios in their homes.

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:34.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would translators accomplish the work

01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:37.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside the branch
with the power coming in and out?

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:40.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers would wait,

01:19:40.559 --> 01:19:44.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as soon as the power came,
they would start working,

01:19:44.129 --> 01:19:47.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what time it was in the day.

01:19:47.098 --> 01:19:51.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers are so dedicated
that they accomplished the work.

01:19:52.237 --> 01:19:53.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very touching.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:56.374 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers who do sign language recordings

01:19:56.374 --> 01:19:57.642 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had to record

01:19:57.642 --> 01:19:59.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of a camera,

01:19:59.377 --> 01:20:00.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they also ideally needed

01:20:00.745 --> 01:20:04.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a background behind them

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:09.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was bright green or bright blue

01:20:09.187 --> 01:20:11.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that their signing could be superimposed

01:20:11.156 --> 01:20:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
onto another video.

01:20:13.158 --> 01:20:16.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so some brothers
were able to get a cloth.

01:20:16.761 --> 01:20:20.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers
painted a wall in their house

01:20:20.265 --> 01:20:22.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this bright chartreuse color.

01:20:22.267 --> 01:20:24.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Admirable ingenuity—thank you.

01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:26.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most interesting solutions

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:30.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that many of the translators
around the world

01:20:30.575 --> 01:20:32.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in different branches would go

01:20:32.944 --> 01:20:34.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into their car late at night

01:20:34.946 --> 01:20:37.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when all the noise had subsided

01:20:37.682 --> 01:20:39.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the neighborhood,
and they would do the recording

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside the car.

01:20:41.119 --> 01:20:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you and everyone working with you
for being so willing to adapt.

01:20:45.357 --> 01:20:47.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your opinion,

01:20:47.792 --> 01:20:50.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what made all of this possible?

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite a global pandemic,

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:54.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite a lockdown

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—none of those things

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:57.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mattered to Jehovah’s organization.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:21:01.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has shut down various other things
throughout the world

01:21:01.806 --> 01:21:06.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proved to be no obstacle for Jehovah
and his earthly organization.

01:21:06.177 --> 01:21:08.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful thing it is

01:21:08.179 --> 01:21:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see this program be something
that’s enjoyed by everyone worldwide!

01:21:13.318 --> 01:21:17.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, despite the conditions
going on in the world around us,

01:21:17.022 --> 01:21:19.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people are moving forward.

01:21:19.624 --> 01:21:23.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you really see
the fulfillment of Malachi 3:18,

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says
that ‘you will see a distinction

01:21:25.997 --> 01:21:29.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between those serving Jehovah
and those who don’t.’

01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:31.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone who had a part in this

01:21:31.536 --> 01:21:34.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the thousands of brothers
and sisters around the world

01:21:34.072 --> 01:21:37.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had a part in bringing
these convention programs

01:21:37.909 --> 01:21:39.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers and sisters—

01:21:39.911 --> 01:21:42.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re just normal people
like you and me,

01:21:42.547 --> 01:21:45.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah uses normal people

01:21:45.717 --> 01:21:48.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish incredible things.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention
has been a landmark convention

01:21:52.023 --> 01:21:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the content
and the beautiful theme,

01:21:55.427 --> 01:21:59.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’ll also remember it
for the way Jehovah helped us

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to produce it in so many languages

01:22:02.267 --> 01:22:06.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers and sisters
in the country and around the world.

01:22:06.071 --> 01:22:09.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in translation, we like verbs,

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:12.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Jehovah’s name, there’s a verb:

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Causes to Become.”

01:22:15.614 --> 01:22:19.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This 2020 convention was proof

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:23.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah causes whatever he wants

01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:26.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become to accomplish his purpose,

01:22:26.224 --> 01:22:29.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if there’s a convention
that Jehovah used

01:22:29.227 --> 01:22:33.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give glory to his name, this is it.

01:22:33.732 --> 01:22:35.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What beautiful conviction!

01:22:35.734 --> 01:22:37.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers.

01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah’s spirit helped ensure

01:22:41.473 --> 01:22:45.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the work was accomplished
in spite of many challenges,

01:22:45.577 --> 01:22:49.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what were some of the blessings
experienced once the work was done?

01:22:56.488 --> 01:22:59.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the convention
is being presented by means of video,

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:02.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s possible to pause
at any time when necessary

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to go back a little bit
to watch something

01:23:04.295 --> 01:23:06.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe we didn’t quite get.

01:23:06.331 --> 01:23:09.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe even because sometimes
our minds drift,

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s good,
because we can go back and rewatch it.

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:15.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this way,
we get even more benefit from the program.

01:23:18.777 --> 01:23:20.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot imagine

01:23:20.779 --> 01:23:23.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a convention more international
than this one.

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how the brothers were able

01:23:25.283 --> 01:23:27.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a difficult situation turn out well

01:23:27.819 --> 01:23:30.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, we’re together,

01:23:30.188 --> 01:23:32.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we’re physically apart
from each other.

01:23:32.857 --> 01:23:35.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are united at this convention.

01:23:45.003 --> 01:23:48.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Volunteers were sent by the elders to travel

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:52.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and obtain the videos
due to lack of Internet in our village.

01:23:54.646 --> 01:23:58.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We traveled about 46 kilometers on foot.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we would leave early in the morning

01:24:04.689 --> 01:24:07.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or late in the evening, 
even traveling at night

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:09.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to obtain the videos.

01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:13.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s blessing,
we overcame

01:24:13.498 --> 01:24:15.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of these challenges.

01:24:23.007 --> 01:24:25.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my dearest wife

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:28.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about two months
before the convention started.

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:30.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was cancer.

01:24:31.249 --> 01:24:33.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had been married for 14 years,

01:24:33.718 --> 01:24:36.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was only 47.

01:24:38.690 --> 01:24:42.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was my greatest partner
in Jehovah’s service,

01:24:42.727 --> 01:24:46.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so this left me with a gaping hole.

01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:55.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme of the convention,
“Always Rejoice”!

01:24:56.374 --> 01:24:59.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came just at the right time for me.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:03.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it was Jehovah’s wonderful gift to me.

01:25:03.047 --> 01:25:06.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the convention,
I could see that Jehovah had sent

01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:11.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the members of the Governing Body
and its helpers to me personally.

01:25:11.089 --> 01:25:14.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t think of a better gift.

01:25:21.466 --> 01:25:25.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoyed the audio descriptions

01:25:25.236 --> 01:25:28.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I am someone who is legally blind,

01:25:28.239 --> 01:25:32.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the audio descriptions
just opened up a whole new world for me.

01:25:32.076 --> 01:25:35.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben walks out of the room
as his coworkers shake their heads.

01:25:39.284 --> 01:25:44.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was really amazing
to have the videos being described.

01:25:44.322 --> 01:25:49.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for me, I felt like I could now “see”

01:25:49.093 --> 01:25:51.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was happening.

01:25:51.095 --> 01:25:54.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of what
the audio descriptions described

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:58.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are things
that I normally would have been curious about

01:25:58.069 --> 01:26:01.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been asking somebody
to help me understand.

01:26:01.773 --> 01:26:04.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had tears in my eyes

01:26:04.442 --> 01:26:08.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that the Governing Body
loves us this much.

01:26:11.449 --> 01:26:14.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I speak Korean.

01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:16.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I speak Japanese.

01:26:17.488 --> 01:26:20.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made a Japanese section
and a Korean section

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like what we would have
at international conventions.

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:27.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to watch
the convention simultaneously, we would count

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:31.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one, two, three and start playing
our videos at the same time.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:34.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way we were able
to watch and sing together.

01:26:34.339 --> 01:26:37.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really felt
like an international convention.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that I thought I would miss a lot
were the Kingdom melodies.

01:26:41.346 --> 01:26:44.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then I wondered:
‘How is this going to work at home?

01:26:44.382 --> 01:26:47.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There won’t be a crowd,
everyone singing together.

01:26:47.752 --> 01:26:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s it going to be?’

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I would really miss it,
but then my family and I agreed

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sing the Kingdom melodies loudly,
and it worked!

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never seen my family sing so loudly.

01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:11.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three children,
and all five of us

01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:13.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at home got COVID-19.

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:16.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all during the time
that the convention was being shown,

01:27:16.814 --> 01:27:18.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were all exhibiting symptoms.

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:20.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a really hard time.

01:27:20.585 --> 01:27:25.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family was so encouraged
by the convention program this year.

01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:28.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife, Marisa, even said that to her,

01:27:28.159 --> 01:27:30.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was as if the talks the brothers gave

01:27:30.561 --> 01:27:32.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were like hearing advice from a close friend

01:27:32.864 --> 01:27:34.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was sitting right next to you

01:27:34.933 --> 01:27:37.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like they were
right in the same room with us.

01:27:41.105 --> 01:27:44.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The convention is very positive;

01:27:45.376 --> 01:27:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s contagious.

01:27:47.378 --> 01:27:49.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has really touched our hearts.

01:27:49.847 --> 01:27:53.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I truly feel the convention
has touched my heart deeply.

01:27:53.885 --> 01:27:57.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both my mom and my dad,
who are right now struggling

01:27:57.288 --> 01:28:00.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with very serious illnesses,

01:28:00.058 --> 01:28:02.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to join me,

01:28:02.427 --> 01:28:04.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my brother, and my sister-in-law,

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:08.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were together
as a family in our living room.

01:28:08.399 --> 01:28:13.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to sing together
and watch the assembly together,

01:28:13.137 --> 01:28:16.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which otherwise
just would not have been possible.

01:28:16.074 --> 01:28:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the struggles,

01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the limitations

01:28:21.112 --> 01:28:23.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we may be facing,

01:28:23.781 --> 01:28:27.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of that has stopped Jehovah
from reaching out

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:32.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even being in our own living rooms
during this convention.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah transforms something

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan is using right now
to take away our joy

01:28:39.464 --> 01:28:41.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into something that gives us joy.

01:28:41.666 --> 01:28:43.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:

01:28:43.134 --> 01:28:46.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re watching the same spiritual program

01:28:46.104 --> 01:28:49.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the same time with the same speakers,
brothers from the Governing Body.

01:28:50.675 --> 01:28:53.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never imagined
that we would have this opportunity.

01:28:55.446 --> 01:28:57.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, are we all set?

01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:09.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, we’re ready whenever you are
if you want to go ahead.

01:29:12.497 --> 01:29:15.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are delighted that you
could join us for this opening session

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “Always Rejoice”!
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:25.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when everything around you is chaotic,

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:30.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

01:29:33.718 --> 01:29:36.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will walk in your truth.

01:29:37.121 --> 01:29:41.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart to fear your name.”

01:30:09.153 --> 01:30:11.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we discovered something we had lost

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:14.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—joy.

01:30:23.434 --> 01:30:27.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what terror,
no matter what trial may come upon us now

01:30:27.171 --> 01:30:31.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the future,
we will be able to continue to rejoice

01:30:31.876 --> 01:30:36.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s acts of salvation.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:45.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While 2020 seemed to be anything
but a time for rejoicing,

01:30:45.623 --> 01:30:48.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this year’s convention proved

01:30:48.259 --> 01:30:51.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter
what the circumstance we are in,

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:53.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will continue to feed us,

01:30:53.965 --> 01:30:57.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will continue to worship him.

01:30:58.803 --> 01:31:01.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, we experienced

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:06.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truthfulness of Philippians 4:4,

01:31:06.077 --> 01:31:09.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter the trail or difficulty,

01:31:09.147 --> 01:31:13.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will “always rejoice in the Lord.”

01:31:27.365 --> 01:31:31.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite changing circumstances,
what can we say?

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:34.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah lived up to the meaning of his name:

01:31:34.939 --> 01:31:37.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Causes to Become.”

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:40.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things happened in quick succession

01:31:40.278 --> 01:31:43.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the support of his will and holy spirit.

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:46.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now back to our studio.

01:31:48.486 --> 01:31:51.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging!

01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second part of the program

01:31:53.991 --> 01:31:56.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be released on January 18

01:31:56.961 --> 01:32:01.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Video on Demand section
of JW Broadcasting.

01:32:01.699 --> 01:32:05.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I’ll be back in the studio next month

01:32:05.903 --> 01:32:09.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to introduce the last part of the program.

01:32:11.142 --> 01:32:14.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude our January monthly program,

01:32:14.478 --> 01:32:18.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll get to know brothers
in the Central African Republic

01:32:18.349 --> 01:32:20.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during our video postcard.

01:32:21.485 --> 01:32:25.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As its name suggests,
the Central African Republic

01:32:25.289 --> 01:32:29.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is near the exact center
of the African continent.

01:32:30.828 --> 01:32:34.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Landlocked, it shares its border
with six neighboring countries

01:32:34.298 --> 01:32:36.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is comparable in size to France.

01:32:37.702 --> 01:32:41.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it has two official languages
—French and Sango—

01:32:41.472 --> 01:32:45.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are also
several other tribal languages spoken.

01:32:45.443 --> 01:32:50.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Central African Republic
is rich in natural resources,

01:32:50.014 --> 01:32:52.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as diamonds, gold, and timber,

01:32:52.683 --> 01:32:56.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to mention beautiful wildlife,
such as antelope,

01:32:56.687 --> 01:32:58.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elephants,

01:32:58.756 --> 01:33:00.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baboons,

01:33:00.925 --> 01:33:05.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leopards, and many others
that roam freely.

01:33:05.196 --> 01:33:09.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, this country has endured many years

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:12.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of armed conflicts and civil unrest,

01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:15.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has resulted in severe hardship
for the people living there.

01:33:17.241 --> 01:33:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite these hardships,
our brothers are working tirelessly

01:33:21.412 --> 01:33:23.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide spiritual relief.

01:33:23.381 --> 01:33:26.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in the Bozoum Congregation,

01:33:26.117 --> 01:33:28.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are some 70 publishers

01:33:28.152 --> 01:33:30.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and several pioneers.

01:33:30.154 --> 01:33:34.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together, they’re conducting
about 150 Bible studies!

01:33:34.692 --> 01:33:38.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides caring for their local territory,

01:33:38.596 --> 01:33:40.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the branch office
has assigned the congregation

01:33:40.831 --> 01:33:43.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the care of three isolated groups.

01:33:43.534 --> 01:33:48.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These groups are
up to 125 kilometers, or 78 miles,

01:33:48.739 --> 01:33:50.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
away from Bozoum.

01:33:50.608 --> 01:33:54.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reaching these groups
is challenging for our brothers,

01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:56.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since there is no public transportation

01:33:56.747 --> 01:34:00.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and only 3 percent
of the roads in the country

01:34:00.685 --> 01:34:02.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are paved.

01:34:02.153 --> 01:34:04.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, the Bozoum Congregation

01:34:04.588 --> 01:34:08.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regularly sends elders to give public talks

01:34:08.192 --> 01:34:10.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and conduct the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study
in Bocaranga,

01:34:10.828 --> 01:34:14.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since there are no appointed brothers
in that group of ten publishers.

01:34:14.999 --> 01:34:18.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there is civil unrest in Bocaranga,

01:34:18.569 --> 01:34:21.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the group is conducting
some 30 Bible studies.

01:34:22.306 --> 01:34:26.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bocaranga brothers and sisters
and the Bozoum Congregation

01:34:26.177 --> 01:34:28.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their greetings to all of you

01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:30.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fellow Witnesses worldwide.

01:34:30.648 --> 01:34:33.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we send our greetings back
to all of our brothers

01:34:33.951 --> 01:34:36.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Central African Republic.

01:34:37.188 --> 01:34:40.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:34:40.424 --> 01:34:43.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
