Welcome!

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s program will help us show love
and respect in marriage.

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are a few highlights.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:12.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your marriage strained

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because your spouse opposes the truth?

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how Alexandru’s love and patience

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
promoted peace in his marriage

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:24.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ultimately moved his wife,
Dorina, to serve Jehovah.

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:27.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how Claudius Johnson
dealt with changing circumstances.

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:33.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new original song
reminds us of the joys of marriage

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on Bible principles.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting® for March 2021!

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah designed marriage

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a beautiful and rewarding relationship

00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:06.216 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
between a husband and a wife.

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:07.684 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When a husband and wife

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.419 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfill their God-given roles

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:10.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and they treat each other

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:12.689 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with love and respect,

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their marriage is a wonderful
and intimate friendship.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A marriage that has good patterns

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:20.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shaped by Jehovah’s principles

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:25.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looks like this well-balanced family circle.

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if a married couple over time

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:30.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has set bad patterns
in how they deal with each other,

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is often the result.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is going to be a bit rough for them.

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider what Jehovah says

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the roles of husband and wife

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then discuss how love and respect

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:46.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are real keys to a happy marriage.

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:48.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what roles did Jehovah give

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the man and woman in marriage?

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:55.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah places the husband
as head of the family.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:23 says:

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:01.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A husband is head of his wife.”

00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means that the husband
makes final decisions for the family.

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his decisions
will reflect his love for his wife,

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his children,
and his understanding of their spiritual,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physical, and emotional needs.

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 11:3,

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:22.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we get a sense, though, of how Jehovah feels
about the husband’s role.

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read this together,
I want you to imagine

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saying to husbands:
‘Yes, you’re head of the family.’

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I want you to know that the head

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:34.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of every man is the Christ;

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in turn, the head of a woman is the man.”

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:41.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds a lot like a father-in-law
speaking to the groom:

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can marry my daughter,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’d better treat her good
because you’re responsible to me.”

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah is giving
a very clear message for husbands.

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will hold you accountable to him

00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:57.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for how you treat your wife.

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something for us husbands
to think about, isn’t it?

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about the role of a wife?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assigned wives
as a beloved partner to her husband.

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as partners,
they can discuss important family matters

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work together
to make their marriage a success.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah placed the woman
under the headship of the man,

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:23.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as such,
her role is to be in subjection to him.

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:26.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ephesians 5:22,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Let wives be in subjection
to their husbands as to the Lord.”

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Subjection
—said a certain way, it almost sounds bad:

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have to be in subjection!”

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is the subjection of a Christian wife
to a Christian husband a bad thing?

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, subjection as described in the Bible

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:50.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not about being subservient;

00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:53.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s about her role in the marriage.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:57.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re partners,
each with a beautiful role to fulfill.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate it
with watching a couple ice skating.

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:05.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they move gracefully across the ice,
do you think to yourself,

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How come they never
let her hold him over her head?’

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look at him; you look at her.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s obvious
who should hold who over their head.

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as we admire and respect
a woman’s role as an ice skating partner,

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a husband deeply loves and appreciates

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:26.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wife’s role as his partner

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they work gracefully together
to make their marriage a success.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now that we’ve briefly reviewed
the roles for husbands and wives,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together
a key Scriptural principle

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ephesians 5:33

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:46.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that shows how Jehovah
wants husbands and wives

00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill their roles in marriage.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:33:

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each one of you must love his wife
as he does himself;

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:03.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the other hand, the wife should have
deep respect for her husband.”

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the obvious message in this scripture

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that husbands should love their wives

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wives should respect their husbands.

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there’s another way
to look at this scripture

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn something about husbands and wives.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God is telling us
what each mate needs.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men need respect, and women need love.

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is not to say
that men don’t need love

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and women don’t need to be respected.

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, it does mean that men

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tend to emphasize respect and status

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and women often emphasize

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intimacy, connection, and love.

00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:47.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This perfect principle
can help us to understand

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why our husband or wife
may act or feel a certain way.

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:57.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this difference in emphasis
affects many areas of married life.

00:05:57.707 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three examples

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how this powerful Scriptural principle
of love and respect

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can give us insight
into how a husband and wife

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:11.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk to each other,

00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:12.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they solve problems,

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they act in the company of others.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.226 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider our first example:

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how they talk to each other.

00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:21.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, since a wife’s emphasis

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on being loved,

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her conversations often stress friendship

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and connection when she talks to her husband.

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:32.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s eager to share
the details of her life with him

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in this way become closer to him.

00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wants him, in turn, to share with her
the details of his day and life.

00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, your wife

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:46.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feels loved when you learn
to communicate with her

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that tells her
you truly care about her.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She places great emphasis
on conversation and sharing her life with you

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and likewise you sharing your life with her.

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a wife

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells her husband about something

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that happened to her that day.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He grows impatient
with the story and interrupts

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or changes the subject
or offers a quick solution.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does she feel?

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why can’t he listen to the whole story?

00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has he lost interest in me?’

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important that husbands give their wives

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their full attention as they speak.

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a long day at work,

00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:32.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his mind may be focused on events
that happened to him that day.

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he may without realizing it

00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel that the events
or conversation of his wife

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
aren’t on important subjects.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he may be inclined
to play down the events in her life

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as unimportant, or trivial,

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:50.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while events he talks
about are substantial and important

00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they happened to him.

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:56.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, such a feeling over time
can truly discourage a wife.

00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A husband’s disinterest in her stories

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and events of her life
feels a lot like disinterest in her.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The advice of Proverbs 20:5
is good for husbands.

00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:15.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The thoughts of a man’s
[or we could say in this case, woman’s] heart

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are like deep waters,

00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the discerning man draws them out.”

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s great advice for husbands.

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, when you draw

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your wife out,
let her speak from her heart.

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:32.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an indication of great love

00:08:32.195 --> 00:08:34.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and affection for your dear wife.

00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:39.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men, on the other hand,
often view conversation differently.

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A husband comes home,
and his wife asks, “How was your day?”

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “It was OK.
Nothing special.”

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later that night
when they’re with a group of friends,

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:51.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he tells a story about what happened at work.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she wonders,

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:57.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, why didn’t he tell me that
when I asked about his day?’

00:08:57.653 --> 00:09:01.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since a man’s emphasis is on respect,

00:09:01.157 --> 00:09:03.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they often use conversation

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:06.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to establish respect and status with others.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:10.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A husband may feel
that his wife already respects him,

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so there’s no need to tell her the story.

00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wives, you can encourage your husband
to share his life with you

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by being interested
in his work and activities.

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:22.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you tell him, “Don’t talk to me

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about all that work stuff with me,” he won’t

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll cut yourself off
from a part of his life.

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:33.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show him that you’re proud
of what he does to support the family.

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be interested in what happened to him,

00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he feels about things,
or challenges that he overcame.

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:41.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you may not find
his work all that interesting,

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember, it is important to him.

00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:48.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider our second example:

00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:50.206 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how they solve problems.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I want you to imagine a husband and wife.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in a car,
they’re looking for an address,

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re lost.

00:09:57.346 --> 00:10:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the wife suggests
that they ask someone for directions.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s thinking, ‘Why won’t he ask?’

00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:09.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s thinking,
‘Why can’t she just let me find it?’

00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:13.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
since the man’s emphasis is on respect,

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:16.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s trying to avoid
looking lost to a stranger.

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:20.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The act of asking someone else for directions

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may make him feel
like he’s in a lower position.

00:10:23.973 --> 00:10:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finding their way is a challenge to him,

00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants to show his wife
that he can find it on his own.

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:33.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the woman,
such an idea may not come to mind.

00:10:33.816 --> 00:10:37.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She may view it as a simple interchange
between them and a stranger.

00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get help and directions,
and they find out where they’re going.

00:10:41.624 --> 00:10:45.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 7:33,
Jehovah tells us:

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:48.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the married man is anxious . . . ,

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:51.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he may gain the approval of his wife.”

00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:57.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wives, your husband is anxious
to have your approval and respect.

00:10:57.306 --> 00:11:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on balance, husbands have to be careful

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an emphasis on respect
doesn’t become unreasonable.

00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t hurt us
to ask for directions or help at times.

00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, a wife needs to be careful

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she doesn’t show impatience
by her words or tone

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as her husband
works his way through a problem.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wife who clearly understands
her husband’s desire

00:11:21.364 --> 00:11:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to solve problems for the family

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:27.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will understand his actions
and will do her part to support him,

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:30.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the little things around the home.

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:33.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this support in the little areas of life

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:36.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
builds his confidence in her support

00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can be a major factor

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whether a husband
takes the lead in larger matters.

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third and final example:

00:11:44.653 --> 00:11:47.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how they act in front of others.

00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:52.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever seen a couple
where one of them is telling a story

00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other
is constantly correcting the details?

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the husband
is trying to give some direction

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:02.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the wife corrects
or challenges the direction?

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:06.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the husband is telling others
some unflattering story

00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that hurts his wife’s feelings?

00:12:09.612 --> 00:12:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can Ephesians 5:33

00:12:12.448 --> 00:12:15.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help a wife in these situations?

00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since a husband’s emphasis
is on respect,

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:21.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll be much more sensitive

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to comments his wife may make
in front of others.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can hurt a husband deeply

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:30.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his wife openly challenges him
in front of others.

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 31:12

00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:37.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has this advice for wives:

00:12:37.773 --> 00:12:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She rewards him with good, not bad,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the days of her life.”

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when in public or when others are around

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even close family and children—

00:12:49.118 --> 00:12:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try not to openly disagree
with him, correct him,

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or attempt to take over what he’s doing.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How you speak to your husband
in front of others

00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a great way
to show your deep respect for him.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also builds respect for him in others,
including any children in the family.

00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can Ephesians 5:33

00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:15.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help a husband act in front of others?

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when in public,
husbands will want to act

00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the husband at Proverbs 31:28.

00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Her husband
rises up and praises her.”

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s common today for husbands to make fun of

00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:34.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even say demeaning things
about their wives.

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:37.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since a wife places so much emphasis

00:13:37.132 --> 00:13:39.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on connection and friendship,

00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:42.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she can really be hurt
when demeaning remarks are said

00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get a laugh; it makes her feel awful.

00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:49.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, your wife
considers you her best friend,

00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one she shares everything with.

00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:56.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you break that trust,
she feels unloved and hurt.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the best time
to bring matters to each other’s attention

00:14:00.656 --> 00:14:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when you’re in private or, if needed,
when you can talk in such a way

00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others cannot hear what’s being said.

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:12.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, a wife
shows deep respect for her husband

00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the husband shows his love for his wife.

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:21.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review,
we’ve considered just three situations

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the principle of love and respect

00:14:24.213 --> 00:14:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help us to have a successful marriage:

00:14:27.983 --> 00:14:30.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how a husband and wife talk to each other,

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:32.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they solve problems,

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:35.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they act in the company of others.

00:14:36.392 --> 00:14:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A good marriage is hard work.

00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:40.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is your marriage?

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:44.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that you’ve developed good patterns

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bad patterns in dealing with each other?

00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:50.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was the last time you talked as a couple

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about love and respect for each other?

00:14:54.343 --> 00:14:58.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s perfect advice at Ephesians 5:33

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help the marriage
of two imperfect people.

00:15:02.851 --> 00:15:05.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a few words in this verse,

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is sharing with us a key principle

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:09.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how he designed marriage.

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:14.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s telling us
what each needs and places emphasis on.

00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:18.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands put emphasis on being respected,

00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:21.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wives put emphasis on being loved.

00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this principle forms a key part

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the divine pattern for marriage.

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want your marriage
to operate as Jehovah designed,

00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then work hard to apply his perfect principle

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of love and respect in your marriage.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we be confident

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:49.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Bible principles
for husbands and wives work?

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they’ve worked
for Jehovah’s people in the past.

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:54.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what wives and husbands

00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:59.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can learn from the example of Sarah.

00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:28.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering where the need is greater
wasn’t easy.

00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a long day in service,
I had a part to work on.

00:16:39.148 --> 00:16:42.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully, Jess took care of everything,

00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:44.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I could focus on my part.

00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:45.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s the best!

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poor thing, she was exhausted.

00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:12.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good thing we were turning in early.

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
William and I couldn’t agree on much lately.

00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:24.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t afford this!

00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There had to be something cheaper,

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he wouldn’t listen.

00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:50.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, I feel that my husband
doesn’t make the best decisions.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wish he’d value my suggestions.

00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:04.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Frankly, I’ve given up trying.

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham,

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:15.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling him lord.”

00:18:15.477 --> 00:18:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 11 and Isaiah chapter 51

00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:22.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also cite Sarah as a fine example
for Christian wives.

00:18:22.818 --> 00:18:24.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Christian husbands

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can also learn much
from carefully examining . . .

00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:29.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:18:29.591 --> 00:18:32.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah’s example: for me.

00:18:47.576 --> 00:18:51.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sarah was willing to move to parts unknown

00:19:02.357 --> 00:19:05.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A life fraught with danger and hardship.”

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She unselfishly supported Abraham

00:19:11.867 --> 00:19:13.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just like my Jessica.

00:19:31.854 --> 00:19:35.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She does without, never complains

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:37.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what a gem!

00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:42.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can do better letting her know

00:19:42.564 --> 00:19:45.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how precious she is to me.

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah submissively obeyed her husband,

00:20:08.757 --> 00:20:11.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she also spoke up.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She loved her son,

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she knew what was at stake

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—God’s promises through Isaac.

00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:56.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though she knew it would upset Abraham,

00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:00.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she spoke up.

00:21:12.254 --> 00:21:14.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She must have thought carefully

00:21:14.423 --> 00:21:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before speaking to him.

00:21:17.826 --> 00:21:21.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, she called him “lord.”

00:21:22.597 --> 00:21:24.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed her

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:28.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her loyal support of Abraham,

00:21:28.103 --> 00:21:31.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even reminding him to listen to her.

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:37.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I couldn’t expect Jehovah

00:21:37.346 --> 00:21:39.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to whisper in my husband’s ear.

00:21:41.683 --> 00:21:45.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did my speech show respect like Sarah’s?

00:21:47.189 --> 00:21:50.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to tell him how I felt,

00:21:50.258 --> 00:21:53.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I needed to do it the right way.

00:21:55.797 --> 00:21:58.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night we spoke,

00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:02.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and little by little
things started to improve.

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:12.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitating Sarah really worked.

00:22:18.787 --> 00:22:23.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next video,
we’ll get to know Claudius Johnson.

00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:26.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though his wife died over 20 years ago,

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:28.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’ll see from his interview

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his spiritual qualities
and focus on Kingdom interests

00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:36.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enhanced his over four decades of marriage.

00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:39.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Prayer is an important thing.

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:42.144 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With everything I do,

00:22:42.144 --> 00:22:44.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always go to Jehovah in prayer

00:22:44.546 --> 00:22:46.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for his guidance.

00:22:47.816 --> 00:22:52.320 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was born on the 26th of March, 1923

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Panama.

00:22:53.722 --> 00:22:57.993 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized in August 1946

00:22:57.993 --> 00:23:00.996 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:03.999 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:08.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in January of 1947.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:13.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a couple of scriptures
that have been most influential in my life.

00:23:13.408 --> 00:23:16.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is Psalm 55:22,

00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:20.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says:
“Throw your burden on Jehovah,

00:23:20.248 --> 00:23:22.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will sustain you.

00:23:22.284 --> 00:23:26.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never will he allow
the righteous one to fall.”

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most trying experiences of my life

00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:33.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was facing the Selective Service Board.

00:23:33.762 --> 00:23:37.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I registered as was required by law,

00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:40.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I received the classification of 1-A

00:23:40.635 --> 00:23:42.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—fit for military service.

00:23:42.304 --> 00:23:45.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I then spoke

00:23:45.273 --> 00:23:47.309 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Society’s Legal Department,

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:49.611 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and I was instructed to appeal the decision

00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:51.646 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I was a regular pioneer.

00:23:52.914 --> 00:23:56.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had to go to the draft board,

00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:58.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there I was severely questioned.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the problems they had

00:24:01.256 --> 00:24:04.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that I had a part-time job,

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they felt that

00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:11.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that interfered with my being classified
as a full-time minister.

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, because I was conducting

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:16.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 12 Bible studies at that time,

00:24:16.438 --> 00:24:18.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took copies

00:24:18.006 --> 00:24:22.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all those records
and presented them to the board.

00:24:22.444 --> 00:24:24.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairman said to me,

00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:26.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are you saying that if we were

00:24:26.648 --> 00:24:29.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to talk to all of these people,
they would tell us

00:24:29.117 --> 00:24:31.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are conducting Bible studies
with them every week?”

00:24:31.253 --> 00:24:33.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, “Yes, Sir.”

00:24:33.688 --> 00:24:37.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While they are deliberating,

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:39.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am praying hard, “Jehovah, help them

00:24:39.194 --> 00:24:41.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a proper decision.”

00:24:41.329 --> 00:24:43.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a few days’ time,

00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:47.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the classification card came as 4-D.

00:24:47.969 --> 00:24:52.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was classified as a Religious Minister,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I lifted my thoughts to Jehovah and said,
“Thank you, Jehovah, very much!”

00:24:57.045 --> 00:25:00.215 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was in the circuit work in Cuba,

00:25:00.215 --> 00:25:03.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had a few encounters with soldiers.

00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:05.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult to understand

00:25:05.787 --> 00:25:07.355 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the tense atmosphere

00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:10.192 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that existed back in those days

00:25:10.192 --> 00:25:12.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the freedom that those rebels had

00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:15.830 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with shooting people—even Batista’s people.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t give it a second thought.

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:22.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had just got through
serving a congregation in the hills,

00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:25.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we took the local bus

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ran around that area.

00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:28.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on the highway,

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two soldiers stopped the bus

00:25:30.812 --> 00:25:33.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ordered all the men to get off.

00:25:33.848 --> 00:25:36.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They started looking
at each of us one by one,

00:25:36.685 --> 00:25:38.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sending everybody back on the bus.

00:25:38.353 --> 00:25:40.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They looked at me and said:
“You! Stay there!”

00:25:40.855 --> 00:25:43.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They pointed a rifle at me
and said, “Who are you?”

00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:45.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I explained myself,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they kept pointing the rifle.

00:25:47.996 --> 00:25:51.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the soldiers said
to the driver, “Take off!”

00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:54.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when you pray hard,

00:25:54.002 --> 00:25:57.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you remember the scripture
at Proverbs 29:25:

00:25:57.906 --> 00:26:01.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trembling at men is a snare,

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:05.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one trusting in Jehovah
will be protected.”

00:26:06.281 --> 00:26:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The driver said: “No!
He’s a circuit overseer!

00:26:10.218 --> 00:26:11.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He rides with me all the time.”

00:26:11.753 --> 00:26:15.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he really defended me
and made me believe

00:26:15.357 --> 00:26:18.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s angels intervened.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why I say
that I am a slave to prayer.

00:26:22.597 --> 00:26:27.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the most important thing in my life.

00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:29.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back to the United States,

00:26:29.204 --> 00:26:31.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was being used

00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:34.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Service Department
in the full-time work.

00:26:34.476 --> 00:26:36.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years later,

00:26:36.745 --> 00:26:38.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to give up the full-time work

00:26:38.546 --> 00:26:41.316 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and take care of my family.

00:26:41.316 --> 00:26:43.318 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The adjustment I had to make

00:26:43.318 --> 00:26:45.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a family man was hard

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because most of my life
was occupied in full-time service.

00:26:50.292 --> 00:26:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had to leave matters

00:26:52.294 --> 00:26:54.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:26:55.797 --> 00:26:58.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started the prison ministry

00:26:58.066 --> 00:27:00.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around May of 1974.

00:27:00.635 --> 00:27:02.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives you a measure of satisfaction

00:27:02.771 --> 00:27:06.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in seeing how the Bible

00:27:06.074 --> 00:27:08.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a very strong influence

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on individuals
—to see criminals

00:27:11.846 --> 00:27:13.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turn their life completely around.

00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:16.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible changes lives,

00:27:16.284 --> 00:27:20.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why pioneering
has always been in my heart.

00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:23.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so after my wife died,

00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:26.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that the proper thing to do

00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:28.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to get back into the full-time service.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of that,

00:27:30.432 --> 00:27:33.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering again in 1998.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God has been good to me,
and at my age of 96,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thank Jehovah every day

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:44.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the health and strength
that he permits me to enjoy

00:27:44.679 --> 00:27:47.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I keep on going.

00:27:50.485 --> 00:27:53.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that it was prayer

00:27:53.154 --> 00:27:55.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped Brother Johnson and his family

00:27:55.323 --> 00:27:58.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face a variety of changing circumstances?

00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:01.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continues to display the same spirit

00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:04.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at nearly 98 years of age.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you married to someone
who doesn’t serve Jehovah

00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:12.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is even opposed to the truth?

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll appreciate the experience
of Alexandru and Dorina Văcar.

00:28:24.652 --> 00:28:28.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible in 1993.

00:28:28.723 --> 00:28:30.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I was 43 years old.

00:28:30.825 --> 00:28:35.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was married for 19 years,
and I had two children.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I didn’t know if I would become

00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:40.435 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or not.

00:28:40.435 --> 00:28:42.871 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I accepted a Bible study.

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:48.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At my husband’s request, I started
studying the Bible at the same time,

00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:51.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I only studied for about a year.

00:28:51.513 --> 00:28:55.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I decided, ‘I’m going to stop.’

00:28:55.049 --> 00:28:58.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him to stop studying too.

00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:00.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him: “Let’s stop studying.

00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:01.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not for us.

00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:03.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t understand it.”

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:07.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in a very diplomatic and calm way,

00:29:07.862 --> 00:29:11.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said he would continue.

00:29:11.132 --> 00:29:14.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I realized
he would continue studying, I said to myself:

00:29:14.402 --> 00:29:16.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, all right then.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just you wait and see.

00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:21.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you really want to continue,
I will somehow make you stop studying

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(in a subtle way), but I will do it.’

00:29:25.747 --> 00:29:29.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just seeing him get ready to go
in field service annoyed me so much.

00:29:29.918 --> 00:29:33.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started burying him with household chores,

00:29:33.221 --> 00:29:36.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him to help me
more and more around the house.

00:29:38.393 --> 00:29:41.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But calmly and gently every time,

00:29:41.062 --> 00:29:44.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would ask me
if he could prepare for meetings.

00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:50.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one time when he asked me
if he could prepare for the meeting,

00:29:50.405 --> 00:29:53.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet again I got irritated and said:

00:29:53.074 --> 00:29:55.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re not going to prepare now.

00:29:55.343 --> 00:29:58.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to clean
the whole apartment thoroughly.”

00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we were finally finished at midnight,

00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:04.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he asked me very calmly

00:30:04.953 --> 00:30:07.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was anything else
he could help me with.

00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:12.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy for him
to deal with my efforts

00:30:12.293 --> 00:30:14.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to force him to stop studying.

00:30:14.362 --> 00:30:16.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after he got baptized,

00:30:16.764 --> 00:30:18.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried even harder.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he never retaliated;
he stayed calm and endured it.

00:30:25.106 --> 00:30:30.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this period, I was trying
to understand her reactions.

00:30:31.513 --> 00:30:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t easy for me.

00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:41.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hearing her criticisms, those harsh replies,
I thought sometimes:

00:30:41.656 --> 00:30:43.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I think I’ll just give up.

00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:46.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes no sense to go on like this.’

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to the brother who was studying
with me about this,

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to stop.”

00:30:55.169 --> 00:30:57.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he encouraged me.

00:30:57.171 --> 00:30:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “No, no, no, don’t stop.

00:30:59.908 --> 00:31:01.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t quit.

00:31:01.342 --> 00:31:02.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Continue, continue.

00:31:02.877 --> 00:31:05.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably your wife will follow you.”

00:31:06.314 --> 00:31:09.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These conversations always encouraged me,

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we finished our study,

00:31:11.352 --> 00:31:14.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would see things
from a different perspective.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always loved my wife,

00:31:17.892 --> 00:31:21.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted her to be by my side.

00:31:23.898 --> 00:31:28.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this period, he often told me
how much he loved me

00:31:28.069 --> 00:31:30.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many times, yes, very often.

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:34.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes he would ask me
if I loved him too.

00:31:34.108 --> 00:31:36.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times when I would answer him,

00:31:36.377 --> 00:31:40.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were times
when I just smiled and said nothing.

00:31:42.283 --> 00:31:47.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I even thought, ‘Hey, this guy
really cares about me.’

00:31:48.222 --> 00:31:50.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was impressed by his kindness.

00:31:50.024 --> 00:31:52.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very impressed.

00:31:53.027 --> 00:31:56.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times, I was musing:
‘Well, as a man, he could hit me.

00:31:56.631 --> 00:32:00.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could be demanding,
“You will sit down,”’ you know.

00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:03.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no, he never did that.

00:32:03.137 --> 00:32:06.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never raised his voice,
never spoke a mean word

00:32:06.908 --> 00:32:08.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never.

00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:11.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she saw that I did not retaliate

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:15.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—as in I would not reply harshly
and I would not talk badly to her—

00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:17.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then eventually

00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would calm down.

00:32:19.988 --> 00:32:24.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his calm and mild way,
he began inviting me to the meetings.

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:28.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept on inviting me,
and sometimes I was willing to accept.

00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:31.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Slowly, I started to attend the meetings.

00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:33.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was happy.

00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:38.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very happy when she said
she wanted to resume her study.

00:32:39.774 --> 00:32:42.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In August 2006,

00:32:42.143 --> 00:32:45.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started studying the Bible again.

00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:49.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in March 2007,
I became an unbaptized publisher.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:53.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in July 2007, I decided to get baptized.

00:32:56.691 --> 00:33:00.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served in the Baptism Department,

00:33:00.528 --> 00:33:05.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had the privilege

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to personally baptize my dear wife.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 13:4 says

00:33:28.823 --> 00:33:31.993 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that “love is patient and kind.”

00:33:31.993 --> 00:33:33.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Patience means,

00:33:33.995 --> 00:33:36.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first of all, being patient for months,

00:33:36.898 --> 00:33:40.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
years, or maybe even decades.

00:33:40.334 --> 00:33:42.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never give up.

00:33:42.537 --> 00:33:45.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never consider someone as a lost cause.

00:33:51.145 --> 00:33:53.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though Alexandru and Dorina’s marriage

00:33:53.981 --> 00:33:56.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was far from ideal for a long time,

00:33:56.918 --> 00:33:59.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alexandru didn’t lose his patience.

00:33:59.754 --> 00:34:02.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was calm and loving.

00:34:02.423 --> 00:34:04.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That promoted peace, and eventually

00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:07.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it moved Dorina to embrace the truth.

00:34:07.662 --> 00:34:10.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have an unbelieving mate,

00:34:10.098 --> 00:34:12.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember Alexandru’s example

00:34:12.834 --> 00:34:16.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as he said, “Never give up.”

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:22.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 4:12
speaks of “a threefold cord”

00:34:22.844 --> 00:34:25.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “cannot quickly be torn apart.”

00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:28.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s often applied to Christian marriage.

00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:32.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does that “threefold cord” mean,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how does it make a marriage successful?

00:34:35.523 --> 00:34:38.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn the answers in our next segment.

00:34:57.879 --> 00:35:00.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was summertime, and a group

00:35:00.248 --> 00:35:03.284 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters made arrangements

00:35:03.284 --> 00:35:05.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during vacation time to go to the beach.

00:35:05.286 --> 00:35:08.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so during that time,

00:35:08.956 --> 00:35:11.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heading to the beach is where I met her.

00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:14.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had met her sisters, but I had not met her.

00:35:15.329 --> 00:35:17.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My grandparents and my aunt

00:35:17.098 --> 00:35:18.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were a very important part

00:35:18.466 --> 00:35:21.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in raising me and my sisters.

00:35:21.769 --> 00:35:24.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They learned the truth first, in Ecuador.

00:35:24.172 --> 00:35:26.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always lived close by.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always went to visit them.

00:35:29.877 --> 00:35:33.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they helped my parents
in guiding me into the truth.

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:38.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first three or four years of our marriage,

00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:40.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were about an hour and a half away from our family.

00:35:40.822 --> 00:35:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was really hard on me
because I’m close to my sisters.

00:35:44.625 --> 00:35:48.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was kind of hard being so far—
To me that was really far.

00:35:48.296 --> 00:35:52.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew early on
that one of the most important things

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I needed in a mate
is someone who loves Jehovah.

00:35:55.803 --> 00:35:57.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they always say—

00:35:57.305 --> 00:35:59.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember my parents
(and at the meetings) always said,

00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:02.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find someone
who loves Jehovah more than they love you.”

00:36:02.343 --> 00:36:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s easy to say that,

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:07.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then you find someone

00:36:07.481 --> 00:36:10.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you realize that she
loves Jehovah more than she loves you.

00:36:10.318 --> 00:36:13.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has demonstrated it
through our entire marriage.

00:36:13.054 --> 00:36:15.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to Jehovah, he’s first.

00:36:15.323 --> 00:36:18.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that is the key
to a successful marriage.

00:36:20.294 --> 00:36:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the biggest challenge
we went through in our marriage

00:36:22.997 --> 00:36:25.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was our first year in the circuit work.

00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:28.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard enough
moving 3,000 miles away from everyone

00:36:28.236 --> 00:36:30.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starting a new type of life.

00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:32.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two months later, my grandfather dies;

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:34.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
six months right after that, my mother dies.

00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:37.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after her mom died, my mom passed away.

00:36:38.813 --> 00:36:40.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one right after the other.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a difficult time for us

00:36:48.356 --> 00:36:50.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all the pain and suffering

00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:53.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from losing our moms and loved ones.

00:36:54.428 --> 00:36:59.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times we felt
that we could not continue.

00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:01.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was overwhelming.

00:37:04.038 --> 00:37:07.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The period of time
was eight months

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:11.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ten days between the death
of Mimi’s mom and my mom.

00:37:20.688 --> 00:37:24.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The threefold cord is a routine
in which Jehovah is included

00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the marriage

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:27.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from reading the Bible together,

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to going in the ministry together,

00:37:29.764 --> 00:37:33.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to doing everyday things together.

00:37:33.401 --> 00:37:38.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you do this,
Jehovah is present in your marriage.

00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:40.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always think that it’s our Bible reading.

00:37:40.908 --> 00:37:42.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we don’t think—we realize

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our Bible reading
is very important for us.

00:37:45.146 --> 00:37:47.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pick a book;
we start reading it, and we know

00:37:47.782 --> 00:37:51.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is what keeps us together.

00:37:52.553 --> 00:37:54.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were both already pioneering
before we got married.

00:37:54.789 --> 00:37:56.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we got married,

00:37:56.924 --> 00:38:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we just figured out a way
to continue pioneering together

00:38:01.095 --> 00:38:05.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure
to start our spiritual careers together.

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:08.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to always depend on Jehovah,

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is the best Person to always depend on.

00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:13.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent a lot of time by ourselves,

00:38:13.774 --> 00:38:17.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
driving from city to city
and from state to state.

00:38:17.144 --> 00:38:20.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had plenty of time to reflect, to talk,

00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:22.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to draw close to each other

00:38:22.483 --> 00:38:27.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to not only rely on Jehovah
but also to be closer between us 

00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:30.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to spend more time

00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:32.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about the visits,

00:38:32.593 --> 00:38:36.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about the friends,
and talking about how we feel.

00:38:36.197 --> 00:38:39.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that at the end
it was the toughest assignment,

00:38:39.667 --> 00:38:42.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was the most rewarding

00:38:42.003 --> 00:38:44.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all the assignments we had had

00:38:44.105 --> 00:38:46.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all these years in the traveling work.

00:38:46.207 --> 00:38:50.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s the three of us
and Jehovah’s an equal part of our marriage,

00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:52.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t matter what we go through

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’s Peter or I
that’s having a little bit of a struggle—

00:38:56.317 --> 00:38:57.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah is there.

00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:00.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to keep us united and strong.

00:39:00.321 --> 00:39:04.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, it’s not just
in the things we do while we worship.

00:39:04.725 --> 00:39:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we worship together,

00:39:06.861 --> 00:39:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also all the other things
that we do Jehovah’s way.

00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:13.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re best friends,
and we enjoy spending time together

00:39:13.401 --> 00:39:16.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside of service and the meetings.

00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:19.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We like doing fun things outside.
We like the outdoors.

00:39:21.342 --> 00:39:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re facing a difficult challenge,
we will go to Jehovah in prayer together

00:39:25.379 --> 00:39:29.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and specifically pray,
“Jehovah, help us with this challenge.”

00:39:29.583 --> 00:39:32.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assignments have helped us

00:39:32.186 --> 00:39:35.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to always be with each other
because we have the same goals in mind.

00:39:35.423 --> 00:39:36.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re working together

00:39:36.524 --> 00:39:38.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the same purpose.

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:42.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the same schedule
—spiritual schedule—

00:39:42.029 --> 00:39:46.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has really helped us to go through
these challenging periods in our life.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:51.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that Jehovah is our Creator,
the Sovereign Being

00:39:51.672 --> 00:39:54.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he’s the one who should tell us what to do.

00:39:54.175 --> 00:39:57.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is an arrangement,
and when you follow his arrangement,

00:39:57.344 --> 00:40:01.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s happiness; there’s success.

00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:03.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in an imperfect world,

00:40:03.684 --> 00:40:08.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his arrangement works,
and we have felt it.

00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:18.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When husbands and wives
are united with Jehovah,

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:22.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their marriage is as strong
as that threefold cord.

00:40:23.404 --> 00:40:27.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible uses another term
to describe the unity of husband and wife:

00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:31.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They . . . become one flesh.”

00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:33.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the topic
of a Morning Worship program

00:40:33.414 --> 00:40:35.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented by Brother Robert Ciranko.

00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:40.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 2:24 says of a man and a woman

00:40:40.554 --> 00:40:41.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who marry that they are

00:40:41.722 --> 00:40:43.657 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “become one flesh.”

00:40:43.657 --> 00:40:46.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, that raises some questions:

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Whose words are those?

00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:50.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What do they mean?

00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:52.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we show that we believe them?

00:40:52.566 --> 00:40:56.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And is there a good example
in the Bible of a couple who did?

00:40:56.303 --> 00:40:59.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with looking at the context.

00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:02.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d open your Bibles,
please, to Genesis chapter 2,

00:41:02.576 --> 00:41:06.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll start with verse 18—Genesis 2.

00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reports: “Then Jehovah God said:

00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:12.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is not good for the man
to continue to be alone.

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:16.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am going to make a helper for him,
as a complement of him.’”

00:41:16.957 --> 00:41:19.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continuing in verse 21:

00:41:19.426 --> 00:41:24.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jehovah God caused the man to fall
into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping,

00:41:24.265 --> 00:41:28.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he took one of his ribs
and then closed up the flesh over its place.

00:41:28.235 --> 00:41:32.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah God built the rib
that he had taken from the man into a woman,

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:34.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he brought her to the man.

00:41:34.074 --> 00:41:35.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the man said:

00:41:35.709 --> 00:41:40.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is at last bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh.

00:41:40.714 --> 00:41:45.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This one will be called Woman,
because from man she was taken.’

00:41:46.487 --> 00:41:49.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why a man will leave
his father and his mother

00:41:49.256 --> 00:41:53.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will stick to his wife,
and they will become one flesh.”

00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:57.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first question is,
Whose words are these?

00:41:57.798 --> 00:41:59.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam’s?

00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:00.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:05.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only words attributed to Adam
are when he waxed poetic in verse 23.

00:42:05.172 --> 00:42:09.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can see that from the opening
and closing quotation marks in that verse.

00:42:09.543 --> 00:42:11.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, then it must have been
Moses’ words because,

00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:14.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after all,
he wrote the Bible book of Genesis.

00:42:14.582 --> 00:42:15.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not present
at the time of the first marriage.

00:42:18.886 --> 00:42:23.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not start writing
until some 2,500 years later,

00:42:23.123 --> 00:42:26.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even then,
he was writing what he was inspired to write.

00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:32.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three Bible writers
use this expression, “one flesh”

00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:34.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew, Mark, and Paul.

00:42:34.768 --> 00:42:38.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s Matthew who gives us
the clue as to whose words they are.

00:42:38.372 --> 00:42:41.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s turn to Matthew chapter 19,

00:42:41.542 --> 00:42:43.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 19

00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:47.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning with verse 4.

00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:54.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Matthew writes and quotes Jesus; 

00:42:54.121 --> 00:42:57.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “In reply he [Jesus] said:

00:42:57.658 --> 00:43:01.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Have you not read
that the one who created them

00:43:01.362 --> 00:43:05.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘from the beginning made
them male and female and said:

00:43:05.799 --> 00:43:09.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“For this reason a man
will leave his father and his mother

00:43:09.637 --> 00:43:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and will stick to his wife,
and the two will be one flesh”?

00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:16.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.

00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:21.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, what God has yoked together,
let no man put apart.’”

00:43:21.215 --> 00:43:25.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Matthew makes it clear
that Jehovah said those words.

00:43:25.753 --> 00:43:28.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And shouldn’t that elevate in everyone’s mind

00:43:28.756 --> 00:43:32.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sanctity of the marital union?

00:43:32.092 --> 00:43:37.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said, ‘God created male and female’
—two complementary genders—

00:43:37.097 --> 00:43:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he ‘yoked them together
in marriage as one flesh.’

00:43:40.668 --> 00:43:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s interesting what
<i>The Bible Exposition Commentary</i> 

00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:47.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says about this:
“God established marriage,

00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:50.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and therefore only God
can control its character . . .

00:43:50.511 --> 00:43:54.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is a union between one man and one woman.

00:43:54.315 --> 00:43:57.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God did not create two men and one woman,

00:43:57.618 --> 00:44:02.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two women and one man,
two men, or two women.

00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:04.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Group marriages,’ ‘gay marriages,’

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:07.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and other variations
are contrary to the will of God, 

00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:10.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what
some psychologists and jurists may say.”

00:44:10.497 --> 00:44:14.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No court of law can change
what God has established.”

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those are comments we can agree with.

00:44:17.971 --> 00:44:22.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our second question is, What do these
words mean: “They will become one flesh”?

00:44:22.976 --> 00:44:27.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the one-flesh relationship
certainly involves sexual union,

00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:32.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it goes beyond that
because it includes a husband and wife

00:44:32.252 --> 00:44:37.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have achieved mental,
emotional, and spiritual harmony.

00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are to have a oneness
in their purpose and desires.

00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Bible translator William Barclay
renders it at Matthew 19:5:

00:44:46.233 --> 00:44:50.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The husband
will be joined inseparably to his wife.”

00:44:50.237 --> 00:44:52.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in marriage, a man and a woman

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to become each other’s
closest partner in life.

00:44:57.077 --> 00:45:00.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being “one flesh” means that they must always

00:45:00.514 --> 00:45:03.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be thinking more
of each other than of themselves,

00:45:03.317 --> 00:45:06.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they must consider
each other in everything they do.

00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:09.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when single people marry,
they need to shift

00:45:09.823 --> 00:45:12.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their thinking from mine to ours,

00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:14.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from me to we.

00:45:14.995 --> 00:45:18.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they must stop being single at heart

00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come to be married at heart,
not just on paper.

00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:23.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our third question is,

00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:25.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we show
that we believe these words?

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:28.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sad to say, many people these days

00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:30.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take a very casual attitude toward marriage,

00:45:30.411 --> 00:45:32.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when the relationship becomes strained,

00:45:32.713 --> 00:45:35.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they just give up and walk out on their mate.

00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:38.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not the Christian way.

00:45:38.051 --> 00:45:41.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriage is to be a lifelong relationship.

00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:44.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few verses later on at Matthew 19:9,

00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:48.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus taught that the only Scriptural ground
for dissolving marriage

00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:50.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when an innocent mate

00:45:50.497 --> 00:45:53.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chooses not to forgive an adulterous partner.

00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:57.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is because sexual relations
outside the marriage bond

00:45:57.838 --> 00:46:02.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a gross perversion
of the one-flesh union.

00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:04.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s read Paul’s words about this

00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians chapter 6

00:46:07.147 --> 00:46:11.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 6:16;

00:46:13.687 --> 00:46:17.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “Do you not know
that anyone who is joined to a prostitute

00:46:17.591 --> 00:46:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is one body with her?

00:46:19.827 --> 00:46:23.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For ‘the two,’ says he,
‘will be one flesh.’”

00:46:23.931 --> 00:46:27.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the adulterer pulls away
from his marriage mate

00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:31.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes himself
one flesh with a third person.

00:46:31.071 --> 00:46:34.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That, then,
is the only Scriptural basis for divorce.

00:46:34.942 --> 00:46:37.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But divorce is a very painful experience.

00:46:37.778 --> 00:46:41.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one sociologist put it,
“Divorce is drastic surgery.”

00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:46.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To sever the one-flesh bond
between husband and wife

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:48.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be like sawing oneself asunder.

00:46:49.723 --> 00:46:52.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though, if no adultery
has been committed?

00:46:52.326 --> 00:46:55.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if, for some reason,
two people who are married to each other

00:46:55.128 --> 00:46:57.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just don’t like each other any longer?

00:46:57.598 --> 00:46:59.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Divorce is not an option.

00:46:59.766 --> 00:47:03.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, they need to remind themselves
of what attracted them to each other

00:47:03.704 --> 00:47:06.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work at rekindling those feelings,

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:09.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time
looking to Jehovah for help 

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:11.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in not only strengthening their marriage

00:47:11.678 --> 00:47:14.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also their spirituality.

00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:16.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our fourth question is,

00:47:16.783 --> 00:47:19.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Scriptural example
is there of a married couple

00:47:19.987 --> 00:47:23.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who believed this one-flesh idea?

00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:27.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Romans 16:3, please,

00:47:27.394 --> 00:47:31.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 16:3; here Paul writes: 

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:36.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give my greetings
to Prisca [or Priscilla] and Aquila,

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.”

00:47:39.072 --> 00:47:44.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, Aquila and Priscilla
—what a model of a close and united couple

00:47:44.077 --> 00:47:47.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living up to what Jehovah meant
when he said that a husband or wife

00:47:47.214 --> 00:47:49.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should become one flesh!

00:47:49.249 --> 00:47:51.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul, who worked closely with them,

00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:53.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not think of that dear brother

00:47:53.987 --> 00:47:57.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without recalling
the faithful cooperation of his wife.

00:47:57.457 --> 00:48:00.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a fine example
for Christian couples today.

00:48:00.727 --> 00:48:03.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in every one
of the six references to this couple

00:48:03.597 --> 00:48:07.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Christian Greek Scriptures,
we find them working together, 

00:48:07.067 --> 00:48:10.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cooperating without competition or strife.

00:48:10.203 --> 00:48:13.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And never is one mentioned without the other.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They constantly worked together
in their home,

00:48:16.443 --> 00:48:19.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their secular work, in the ministry.

00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:22.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And surely it was the time
spent together in Christian activities

00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:26.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that kept their marriage
on a high spiritual plane,

00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:29.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working side by side
to further the Kingdom work.

00:48:29.556 --> 00:48:32.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you and your marriage mate may be apart

00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:35.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for much of the day
due to different work and responsibilities.

00:48:35.796 --> 00:48:40.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you find time each day
to eat meals together,

00:48:40.133 --> 00:48:44.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do household chores together,
to take walks together,

00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:46.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be together to get caught up

00:48:46.607 --> 00:48:49.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what has gone on
in your lives during the day?

00:48:49.776 --> 00:48:52.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aquila and Priscilla proved that being united

00:48:52.546 --> 00:48:54.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in activities related to true worship

00:48:54.715 --> 00:48:57.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can keep a couple’s thinking
and goals aligned,

00:48:57.918 --> 00:49:00.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that does strengthen a marriage.

00:49:00.554 --> 00:49:03.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, studying together,

00:49:03.156 --> 00:49:06.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
participating
in congregation meetings together,

00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:09.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing in the ministry together,
praying together,

00:49:09.296 --> 00:49:11.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in doing all of that,

00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:15.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a person’s interests, priorities, and habits

00:49:15.636 --> 00:49:20.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will harmonize with those
of one’s spouse until,

00:49:20.273 --> 00:49:22.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Aquila and Priscilla,

00:49:22.743 --> 00:49:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we increasingly think, feel,

00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:28.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act as one flesh.

00:49:28.115 --> 00:49:30.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we know who said the words.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah.

00:49:31.652 --> 00:49:34.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We understand what they mean
—achieving harmony

00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:37.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one’s relationship with one’s mate.

00:49:37.257 --> 00:49:40.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can certainly prove
that we believe these words

00:49:40.761 --> 00:49:45.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by staying close to our mate
and maintaining our marriage bond.

00:49:45.632 --> 00:49:50.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we have that excellent example
of Aquila and Priscilla to abide by.

00:49:51.705 --> 00:49:55.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One flesh,” “a threefold cord”

00:49:55.208 --> 00:49:58.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when a husband and wife
apply Bible principles,

00:49:58.679 --> 00:50:01.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their marriage endures and is successful.

00:50:01.982 --> 00:50:05.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll see that in our new music video.

00:50:28.475 --> 00:50:36.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re the one,
The only one for me.

00:50:37.918 --> 00:50:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re my love,
My one and only.

00:50:48.895 --> 00:50:59.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your qualities, your faith—
They bring me such delight.

00:50:59.706 --> 00:51:11.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with God’s help,
I know our future’s bright.

00:51:11.251 --> 00:51:20.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It fills my heart with love
To know you stand by me.

00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:31.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel your deep respect;
I know you’re proud of me.

00:51:31.638 --> 00:51:41.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together we can be strong;
Together’s where we belong.

00:51:41.615 --> 00:51:52.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helps us stay more in love each day—
My only one.

00:52:36.436 --> 00:52:46.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re the one for me;
You listen to my thoughts.

00:52:46.279 --> 00:52:57.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a team,
We work hard for our God.

00:52:57.457 --> 00:53:07.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, in my heart I feel
You cherish me, my love.

00:53:07.234 --> 00:53:19.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll always be the one—
The one I’m so proud of.

00:53:19.179 --> 00:53:28.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together we can be strong;
Together’s where we belong.

00:53:28.521 --> 00:53:38.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helps us stay more in love each day—
My only one.

00:53:38.832 --> 00:53:49.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together we can be strong;
Together’s where we belong.

00:53:49.943 --> 00:54:01.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helps us stay more in love each day—
My only one,

00:54:01.054 --> 00:54:12.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My only one,
My love.

00:54:13.633 --> 00:54:16.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme of this month’s program was

00:54:16.369 --> 00:54:19.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Show Love and Respect in Your Marriage.”

00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:22.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah’s example shows wives

00:54:22.208 --> 00:54:24.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to give their husbands suggestions

00:54:24.444 --> 00:54:26.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and husbands how to show

00:54:26.446 --> 00:54:29.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciation for their wives.

00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:32.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned the importance of prayer
when we face changing circumstances.

00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Alexandru’s love and patience

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:39.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped his wife serve Jehovah.

00:54:39.659 --> 00:54:42.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By integrating Jehovah into their marriage,

00:54:42.762 --> 00:54:46.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
couples can overcome challenges
and serve Jehovah together.

This month we visit
our brothers and sisters in Guyana.

00:54:54.507 --> 00:54:58.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This country of more than 750,000 people

00:54:58.511 --> 00:55:01.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the northeastern corner
of South America.

00:55:01.781 --> 00:55:05.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a land of lush rain forests,

00:55:05.552 --> 00:55:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sugarcane plantations, and open grasslands.

00:55:09.556 --> 00:55:14.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Temperatures and humidity are high,
and the rainfall is heavy.

00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:18.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Guyana means “land of water.”

00:55:18.698 --> 00:55:21.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers
are with the congregation in Charity,

00:55:21.368 --> 00:55:24.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a part of Guyana known
for extensive preaching done along the river.

00:55:25.672 --> 00:55:28.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than half
of Guyana’s population is rural,

00:55:28.174 --> 00:55:32.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and most people live in villages
in the coastal region.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:35.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Baramita,
a Carib-language-speaking community

00:55:35.915 --> 00:55:37.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known for gold mining.

00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:40.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation’s 119 publishers

00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:45.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conduct an average
of 228 Bible studies every month.

00:55:46.459 --> 00:55:48.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baramita is also home
to a remote translation office.

00:55:51.464 --> 00:55:54.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people live scattered
throughout the surrounding dense jungle.

00:55:54.901 --> 00:55:58.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And reaching them
requires hours and hours of walking.

00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:02.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the rainy season
is over half of the year,

00:56:02.409 --> 00:56:04.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
travel can be very difficult.

00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:07.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our brothers and sisters
—they’re not deterred by the terrain.

00:56:08.848 --> 00:56:12.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these are typical dwellings
of the Carib community in Baramita.

00:56:12.852 --> 00:56:16.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, our brothers
—they preach to everyone they encounter,

00:56:16.856 --> 00:56:19.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from cassava farmers to gold miners.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Baramita Congregation

00:56:23.396 --> 00:56:27.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send you their warm love and greetings.

00:56:27.067 --> 00:56:29.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:29.335 --> 00:56:31.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
