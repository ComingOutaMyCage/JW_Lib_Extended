Welcome!

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re so happy you can join us

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for this month’s program.

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:08.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m here with my good friend

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:10.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cohost, Leon Weaver.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he is.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leon, welcome!

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David, I’m delighted to be here with you.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’d like to tell you
a little something about Leon.

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:22.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was invited into Bethel in 1990,

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to the Service Department

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Leon was one of the overseers.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the Service Department,

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at times we had to deal
with some very difficult matters

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes you needed advice.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could always rely
on Leon to help me out.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d go into his office,

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d set aside whatever it was
he was working on,

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:47.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d listen, and then he’d give his input.

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciated the experience
I acquired in the Service Department,

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:54.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Leon was certainly part of it.

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:58.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is one reason why I have love

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect for that brother.

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Leon, what can we look forward to
in this month’s program?

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many years ago,

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:09.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth gave up a prestigious career

00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:11.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do more for Jehovah.

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:12.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did her decision

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
change the course of her life?

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:20.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll debut a fascinating new series.

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will reveal aspects
of our theocratic history

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:26.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may not be familiar with.

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds very interesting.

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t go away!

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:35.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting® for November 2021.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.634 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Through his prophet Isaiah,

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:00.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made a wonderful promise,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.338 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one that’s being fulfilled today.

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:07.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can read about it at Isaiah 60:17:

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:11.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instead of the iron
I will bring in silver,

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:16.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“instead of the wood, copper,

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:19.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instead of the stones, iron;

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will appoint peace as your overseers

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and righteousness as your task assigners.”

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, this reference to “overseers”

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:33.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “task assigners”
—that sounds like organization, doesn’t it?

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:36.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Jehovah telling us?

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s saying that we can expect

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:42.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see organizational arrangements
getting better and better.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you’ve been associated
with the truth for a while,

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree that Isaiah’s prophecy
is being fulfilled today.

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for this broadcast,

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we’d review
some of the improvements

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve seen just since World War II.

00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:01.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the period
most of us are familiar with.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of you will be hearing
about these things for the first time.

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others will have lived through it all,

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for them it’ll bring back fond memories.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s go back.
It’ll be fun!

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:18.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I call this part
“Do You Remember When . . . ?”

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before World War II
and for a number of years after that,

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:27.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many congregations
didn’t have a Kingdom Hall of their own.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They were actually encouraged

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:32.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to meet in private homes

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:34.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or in rented facilities.

00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:36.733 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The thinking was that if you

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.235 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were in a rented facility or a private home,

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:40.470 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you had more flexibility.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You could move the meeting place

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.041 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from one place to the other very easily.

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:47.143 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But there were problems; there were drawbacks.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.745 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the space

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:50.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be shared with other organizations.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:52.782 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So you couldn’t leave your

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
literature, magazines,

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:57.053 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
speaker’s stand, and maybe even a sound system

00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:58.955 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the hall at the end of the meeting.

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the meeting was over,
you’d have to pack it all up

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take it away.

00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:06.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you had to arrive very early
and clean the place up 

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:15.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after a particularly rowdy group
of people had used it.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:19.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if there were cigar smokers
in that group, you were in trouble.

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:23.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very difficult to air the place out
in time for the meeting.

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:28.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, remember, in those days,
people could smoke in a private hall,

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:32.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you could smoke in an airplane
—they could smoke almost anywhere.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a real problem for us.

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were other problems.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we had a Kingdom Hall in my hometown,

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:43.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation met in a rented facility.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:47.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in October,
the place was decorated for Halloween,

00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:51.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in December, there was
a great big Christmas tree on the platform.

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t move it!

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was in Canada,

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:57.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and portraits
of the King and Queen of England

00:04:57.513 --> 00:05:01.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the British flag
were permanent fixtures in the hall.

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:04.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You couldn’t remove
any of it for the meeting.

00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, to their credit,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many interested persons
attended our meetings.

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:13.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to them, it wasn’t
the meeting place that was important;

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:16.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was what
they were learning there that counted.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of our meeting places,

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:21.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at first, congregations were on their own

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.773 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when it came to building them.

00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:26.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, at times, the most a congregation

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:28.411 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
could afford was to purchase the land,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.279 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes that land would sit there

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for years because it would

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:34.017 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take years to get the money together

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:35.518 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to build the hall.

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then once they had the money together,

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:41.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were there enough brothers who could take

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:43.760 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the lead in the construction?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.162 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes on a weekend, you’d see

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:48.031 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
just one or two brothers working away

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:49.499 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the site of the new hall.

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:53.436 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You had to love them for their perseverance.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Nowadays,

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Kingdom Hall construction
is supervised by the LDCs,

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with lots of qualified volunteers,

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:04.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and practical Kingdom Halls
can be constructed in a short period of time.

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the meetings?

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years, the Theocratic Ministry School,
Service Meeting,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Congregation Book Study,
and <i>Watchtower</i>  Study

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were all about an hour in length.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So were the public talks

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when we had them.

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at first, a public talk
wasn’t scheduled every week.

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’d be a series of four or eight talks,

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you could schedule that many speakers.

00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:32.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, for a while,
the congregation wouldn’t have a public talk.

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was that?

00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:36.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Remember,

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.047 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Theocratic Ministry School

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:40.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
didn’t get under way until 1943,

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:42.418 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it took time for the brothers to develop

00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:45.054 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the skills to deliver an hour talk.

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.690 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in time, they were delivering

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.692 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
excellent public talks!

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we had individual handbills

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:55.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each public talk

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the name of the speaker printed on them?

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until 1959,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only brothers were enrolled in the school.

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some years, during the first few minutes

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the school there was a roll call,

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the names of all the brothers
enrolled in the school were read out.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:17.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when your name was read out,
you were to answer, “Present.”

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few rebels would say, “Here.”

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you were supposed to say, “Present.”

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, initially,
according to the instructions,

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if anyone was deliberately

00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and habitually absent over a period of time,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was dropped from the school.

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:36.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, that was discontinued.

00:07:36.906 --> 00:07:41.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the roll-call arrangement
got me into a bit of trouble.

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:44.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in our congregation
when the roll was being called each week,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed that there
were a few young brothers

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:51.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were just a little bit older than I was
who would answer, “Present.”

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one night after the school,
I asked the school servant

00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I could have my name read out
at the next meeting.

00:07:57.793 --> 00:07:59.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He warmly commended me.

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sure enough,
I got my name read out the following week.

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone congratulated me after the meeting.

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:08.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t understand why.

00:08:08.437 --> 00:08:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only said, “Present.”

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:14.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem was that I didn’t know
that when you got your name read out,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were agreeing to give a talk.

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I was just signing up
to have my name read out.

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:25.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a couple of months later,
on April 8, 1953,

00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:28.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I delivered my first
eight-minute talk on the theme

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Proclaiming the World’s Doom.”

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why an eight-minute talk?

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we didn’t have Bible readings yet.

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you were on the school,

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:40.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were giving an eight-minute talk.

00:08:40.636 --> 00:08:45.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today, we make sure
everyone understands what’s involved

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being a student in the midweek meeting.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.912 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1950,

00:08:49.912 --> 00:08:52.014 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we received the <i>New World Translation </i>

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:54.550 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures</i>  in English,

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.918 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we were encouraged

00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:57.220 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to bring it to the meetings.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the Hebrew Scriptures,
you would have the <i>American Standard Version </i>

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the <i>King James Version </i>

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—</i>mostly the <i>American Standard Version </i>

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it had Jehovah’s name.

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:08.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’d have two Bibles
to bring to the meeting.

00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:11.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s the one for the Hebrew Scriptures

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:14.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the <i>New World Translation</i>
for the Greek Scriptures—two Bibles.

00:09:14.503 --> 00:09:15.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t too bad.

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:20.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later, the <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Hebrew Scriptures</i>

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:22.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was released in installments.

00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’d get a volume every year or two.

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we received each new volume,

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:30.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were encouraged
to bring it to the meeting.

00:09:30.586 --> 00:09:34.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in time, those volumes
started to pile up

00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that by 1960,

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:40.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might have volumes 1 through 5
of the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also the Greek Scriptures,
and your regular study aids!

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had thick study aids in those days.

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:50.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had big briefcases
and strong backs in those days.

00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:54.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really happy to get
the complete <i>New World Translation </i>

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just one volume in 1961.

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:01.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s say a word about music.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something that’s near
and dear to my heart.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:08.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many years,
it was left up to the local servants

00:10:08.624 --> 00:10:11.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to decide which songs the congregation
would sing at the meetings.

00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:15.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the chairman of a particular meeting
would select the songs,

00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his choice wasn’t always final.

00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:20.803 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many Kingdom Halls had a piano

00:10:20.803 --> 00:10:22.238 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or some other instrument

00:10:22.238 --> 00:10:23.572 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to accompany the singing.

00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But often the musician couldn’t play
all of the songs in the book,

00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’d have to sing the songs he could play.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to know those few songs really well!

00:10:34.684 --> 00:10:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those humble musicians
did their best to accompany our singing.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as a result of all this,

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:44.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the words to those songs
we sang nearly 70 years ago

00:10:44.994 --> 00:10:47.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still come readily to mind.

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the written review?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you don’t.

00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Congregations periodically

00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a written review of material
that had been covered

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Theocratic Ministry School
over the previous weeks.

00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:03.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we had a half hour to answer

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 25 questions.

00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, when the half hour was up,

00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:10.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would write our name on the paper,

00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:13.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hand it in to the school servant,

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would take
all the papers home to grade them.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:20.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if there were 25 questions,
you’d get 4 points apiece

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:23.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each correct answer—100 points total.

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:27.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then a week later,
he’d return the papers to us at the meeting.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the early years of the arrangement
(I remember well),

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d announce the highest
and lowest grade to the congregation.

00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:38.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, thankfully, he didn’t mention the names

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:41.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the one who got
the highest and lowest score.

00:11:41.317 --> 00:11:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, later, that arrangement to announce

00:11:43.386 --> 00:11:46.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the highest and lowest grade
was discontinued.

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:49.024 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when circuit assemblies

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:51.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
began on Friday evening

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and continued through Sunday afternoon?

00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:54.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A full program

00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:58.000 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was presented Saturday afternoon and evening.

00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:00.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There was never a dull moment

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:01.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on Saturday night.

00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:03.205 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There were lively demonstrations

00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:04.573 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that kept our interest

00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:06.075 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
right up to the end of the program.

00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:11.714 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the sets were very elaborate.

00:12:11.714 --> 00:12:14.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
suppose a publisher was demonstrating

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a presentation from door to door.

00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:20.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, today
we’d just imagine there was a door.

00:12:20.556 --> 00:12:23.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But back then at the circuit assembly,

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:27.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there might be a frame
with a painted door on the stage,

00:12:27.229 --> 00:12:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even a doorbell
for the publisher to ring.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if the householder
was supposed to be interested,

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew it
because the house number was 777.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the householder
was going to be opposed,

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew that as well
because the house number would be 666.

00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, on one program that I remember,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publisher knocks on the door
and a brother dressed as a priest answers.

00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He puts up a real argument about the Trinity.

00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:57.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk about visual aids

00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but you never forgot what you saw and heard!

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:07.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember when
each congregation had a congregation servant

00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:09.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and up to seven other servants:

00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the assistant congregation servant,
the Bible study servant,

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the accounts servant,
the <i>Watchtower</i>  study servant,

00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:19.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the magazine-territory servant,
the literature servant, 

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:21.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Theocratic Ministry School servant?

00:13:21.617 --> 00:13:24.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at that time,
apart from book study conductors,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you couldn’t have more than
eight servants in the congregation.

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:32.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So unless someone moved,

00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:36.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a young man had no chance
of becoming a servant.

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how could a young man
reach out for more responsibility?

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how would the prophecy recorded

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Micah 5:5 ever be fulfilled?

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There Jehovah promised:

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We will raise up against him
seven shepherds,

00:13:52.448 --> 00:13:56.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, eight princes of mankind.”

00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, seven represents completeness.

00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:01.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So eight princes—that would indicate

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:04.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be
more than enough men in the congregations

00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:06.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide theocratic direction.

00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how could that be
when there was basically

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a limit of eight servants per congregation?

00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:16.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer came in 1971.

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrilled when we understood

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that each congregation has a body of elders,

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there is no set number
of elders or ministerial servants.

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As many as are qualified can be appointed.

00:14:30.486 --> 00:14:34.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I was baptized 66 years ago,

00:14:34.723 --> 00:14:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you didn’t have to be approved
for baptism by the congregation.

00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:42.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only questions asked
of baptism candidates

00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:45.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were the two they answered
at the conclusion of the baptism talk.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led to a few strange situations.

00:14:49.338 --> 00:14:51.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On a few occasions

00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:53.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—much to the surprise of the servants—

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:55.010 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
someone would rush up

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.245 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the front of the hall at the end

00:14:56.245 --> 00:14:57.446 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the baptism talk,

00:14:57.446 --> 00:14:59.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
answer the two questions,

00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:02.051 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and get baptized.

00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something more was needed

00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:08.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—assurance that the individual
really knew what he was doing

00:15:08.223 --> 00:15:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially that he was living
in harmony with Scriptural principles.

00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:15.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1967,

00:15:15.397 --> 00:15:19.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
questions were provided
so that the responsible brothers

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be assured that each candidate
was truly qualified for baptism.

00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:27.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those questions have been refined
over the years.

00:15:27.476 --> 00:15:31.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, we go over some 60 questions

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with baptism candidates.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The copper has turned to gold.

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:38.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when there were

00:15:38.787 --> 00:15:41.657 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
very few pictures in our publications?

00:15:41.657 --> 00:15:42.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the few that we had

00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:44.493 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were usually in black and white

00:15:44.493 --> 00:15:46.662 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or only two colors.

00:15:46.662 --> 00:15:48.831 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, our spiritual food

00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:51.200 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is served in attractive publications

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in full color.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those of us who’ve served

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in foreign-language congregations
will also remember

00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:00.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a new publication in English

00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might not be available
in another language for several years.

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:09.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Study articles trailed by several months.

00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s before it became possible
for the branches

00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:14.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do simultaneous printing.

00:16:14.123 --> 00:16:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s how it worked.

00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Material in English
would be mailed to the branches

00:16:19.294 --> 00:16:21.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by regular mail for translation.

00:16:21.864 --> 00:16:26.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the translators had a question
about the meaning of a sentence in English,

00:16:26.802 --> 00:16:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would use regular mail
to send their question to headquarters.

00:16:30.973 --> 00:16:34.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, headquarters would answer back
by regular mail.

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:37.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This back and forth
—it could take quite a while.

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in some countries, mail service was poor.

00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, today,
thanks to special computer programs

00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:47.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers have developed

00:16:47.723 --> 00:16:49.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ability to communicate electronically

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some other factors, we’re able to release

00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:56.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most language editions simultaneously
with the English.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an improvement!

00:16:59.702 --> 00:17:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking of our literature,

00:17:02.004 --> 00:17:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you realize that it’s been some 31 years

00:17:06.075 --> 00:17:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the decision was made
that in the United States

00:17:09.144 --> 00:17:12.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d no longer ask
for a contribution for our literature?

00:17:12.581 --> 00:17:16.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, the arrangement
was extended worldwide.

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:20.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s been a real blessing for our brothers!

00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:22.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:17:22.558 --> 00:17:25.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were asking
for contributions for literature,

00:17:25.594 --> 00:17:28.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some brothers in Africa and other places

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
couldn’t afford to have a <i>Watchtower </i>
for every member of the family.

00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:35.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were just too poor.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about bound books?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you an experience.

00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one African country, a missionary noticed

00:17:43.178 --> 00:17:46.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a young brother quoted
a wide variety of scriptures

00:17:46.048 --> 00:17:48.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his comments, and he got curious.

00:17:48.884 --> 00:17:50.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, he asked the young brother,

00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:53.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How did you come to know
so many scriptures?”

00:17:53.956 --> 00:17:56.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother replied:
“It’s the <i>Reasoning </i> book.

00:17:56.925 --> 00:18:00.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it every chance I get.”

00:18:00.295 --> 00:18:02.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The missionary asked him, “What do you mean

00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:05.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you read it every chance you get?”

00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he replied:
“I don’t have a <i>Reasoning</i>  book myself.

00:18:09.772 --> 00:18:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never afford one.

00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I know a sister who has one,

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she lets me borrow it from time to time.

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it every chance I get.”

00:18:21.483 --> 00:18:23.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can imagine,

00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:26.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the missionary went out
and bought him a <i>Reasoning </i> book

00:18:26.388 --> 00:18:29.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a <i>New World Translation </i>
for good measure.

00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:32.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a great investment.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young brother
was later called into Bethel,

00:18:34.563 --> 00:18:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where do you think he was assigned?

00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:39.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the literature department.

00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:43.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers knew
that he appreciated the literature so much

00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:47.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’d make sure the congregations
had the literature they needed.

00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:51.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, looking back,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that the arrangements
back then served a purpose.

00:18:54.783 --> 00:18:57.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like fine copper.

00:18:57.085 --> 00:19:00.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not look down on them.

00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:02.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we take the view expressed

00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Zechariah 4:10:

00:19:05.127 --> 00:19:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who has despised the day

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:10.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of small beginnings?”

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as those taking the lead
saw a better way of doing things,

00:19:14.837 --> 00:19:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t hesitate to make adjustments.

00:19:17.439 --> 00:19:19.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very faith-strengthening.

00:19:19.942 --> 00:19:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the best is yet to come!

00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I mentioned in the beginning,

00:19:26.815 --> 00:19:30.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this may be the first time that some of you
have heard about these things.

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:33.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not ask someone
who has been in the truth for many years

00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:35.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it was like
when he was new in the truth?

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That could lead
to a very stimulating discussion!

00:19:40.729 --> 00:19:42.130 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.200 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for those historical insights, David.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.336 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When you think about

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:51.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much has changed just in our lifetimes,

00:19:51.139 --> 00:19:53.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you really see how Jehovah

00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keeps improving his organization.

00:19:57.246 --> 00:20:00.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we have a great example

00:20:00.582 --> 00:20:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of someone who has seen all of the changes

00:20:04.653 --> 00:20:09.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve talked about and more: John Mills.

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how he
has faithfully served Jehovah

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:16.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through multiple assignments and challenges.

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:25.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised with three sisters,
and my mom was in the truth.

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:29.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember sitting on the sofa

00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:32.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just talking about spiritual things
with my mom.

00:20:34.716 --> 00:20:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she taught us to appreciate
any assignment that we had

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see it as something very special.

00:20:42.925 --> 00:20:44.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering was my life.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Gilead to me was a way to give to others

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.235 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—to be very busy in service.

00:20:53.235 --> 00:20:54.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:56.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I really want to go to Gilead

00:20:56.638 --> 00:21:01.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, if it’s possible, to have a wife too.”

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just thought, ‘Boy, are you pushy!’

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:07.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, and so—

00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave me that.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to Gilead.

00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:16.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to my amazement,

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was the most lovely, spiritual sister,

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a student in the same class, Lois.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I met her and was able to marry her

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one week after Gilead.

00:21:35.177 --> 00:21:37.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arriving as a newlywed couple

00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:42.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a missionary home with seven other people

00:21:42.517 --> 00:21:44.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was quite daunting.

00:21:44.252 --> 00:21:47.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we didn’t let that faze us;
we were on our honeymoon.

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:52.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colombia was a paradise spiritually.

00:21:52.594 --> 00:21:54.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved it so much!

00:21:54.596 --> 00:21:57.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the kind of life we wanted.

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:03.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lois was a great teacher in the ministry.

00:22:04.606 --> 00:22:09.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always enjoyed working with her;
she was actually a great support for me.

00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:14.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Colombia had its risks.

00:22:14.883 --> 00:22:18.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember in the mornings,
sometimes it got to the point when

00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:22.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would look at Lois and she would look
at me and we’d just say,

00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:26.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I don’t see you, see you
in the Paradise,” you know?

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:30.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colombia became our home.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We traveled the length and breadth

00:22:33.568 --> 00:22:36.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the country
in our different assignments.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:41.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had been over 20 years in Colombia
when it became very evident

00:22:41.743 --> 00:22:45.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Lois’s mom would need our care.

00:22:46.314 --> 00:22:49.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, of course,
would mean leaving our assignment.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It almost tore my heart apart
to leave Colombia.

00:22:56.992 --> 00:23:01.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt I was abandoning so many privileges

00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:04.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my treasured assignment.

00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:08.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the U.S.A.,

00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were working as a team,

00:23:12.274 --> 00:23:16.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could see Lois really organized,

00:23:16.244 --> 00:23:19.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the best of the situation.

00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping her mom

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really the source,

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:27.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way, of her deep joy.

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:30.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping others was just a way of life

00:23:30.258 --> 00:23:32.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Lois.

00:23:32.327 --> 00:23:36.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter what privilege you have

00:23:36.698 --> 00:23:39.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what responsibility;

00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:43.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true happiness

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always found in giving.

00:23:47.275 --> 00:23:51.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, Lois got very ill.

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lois never cried about her illness

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or felt sorry for herself.

00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:59.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She always was focused on others

00:23:59.054 --> 00:24:03.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would give of herself, even 

00:24:03.992 --> 00:24:06.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the pain of illness.

00:24:08.063 --> 00:24:11.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that Lois has passed,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times I think of her example,

00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just motivates me to carry on.

00:24:21.776 --> 00:24:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at the Central America branch

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:28.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am surrounded by such a loving family.

00:24:28.617 --> 00:24:31.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I resolved when

00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:34.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went through this situation

00:24:34.756 --> 00:24:39.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with losing my wife to find others

00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:42.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were in similar situations

00:24:42.597 --> 00:24:46.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe sit down for a coffee.

00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:49.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just that fellow feeling

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of just being able

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show interest and to encourage

00:24:54.442 --> 00:24:58.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another person is a great joy

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:03.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I personally find one
of the most helpful things

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:06.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure trials.

00:25:09.524 --> 00:25:14.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John’s life of faithful service reminds me

00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:19.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the truth found at 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:

00:25:19.534 --> 00:25:24.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Jehovah] comforts us in all our trials

00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:27.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that we may be able to comfort others

00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in any sort of trial with the comfort

00:25:32.047 --> 00:25:34.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive from God.”

00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:39.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever wondered

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:42.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we sing at our meetings?

00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:47.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or why we attend conventions,
usually in the summer?

00:25:49.164 --> 00:25:53.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many who are young in years
or new in the truth

00:25:53.034 --> 00:25:57.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may not be familiar
with certain aspects of our history.

00:25:57.305 --> 00:26:01.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, this rich spiritual history

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:03.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is your heritage,

00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:07.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want you to become acquainted with it.

00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Governing Body

00:26:10.085 --> 00:26:15.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has approved the development of a new series: 

00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:18.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each segment will look at an aspect

00:26:22.364 --> 00:26:25.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our worship through time,

00:26:25.133 --> 00:26:28.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar to what David shared with us earlier.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The series will help us see

00:26:31.072 --> 00:26:33.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our worship is rooted,

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:36.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in tradition or custom,

00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:40.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the truth found in God’s Word.

00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:45.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for our first episode,

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:50.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it looks at the history
of singing praises to Jehovah.

00:26:54.396 --> 00:26:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was made in secret,

00:26:56.898 --> 00:26:59.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hidden in the lining of a jacket,

00:27:00.635 --> 00:27:03.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then smuggled out of the country.

00:27:03.104 --> 00:27:05.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:27:05.106 --> 00:27:09.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A recording
of brothers and sisters in Siberia

00:27:09.611 --> 00:27:12.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
singing Kingdom songs.

00:27:12.447 --> 00:27:15.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent it from one side
of the earth to the other 

00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:20.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be played at the 1958
international convention in New York

00:27:20.822 --> 00:27:25.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an audience of more than 250,000 people.

00:27:26.494 --> 00:27:31.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is singing so important
to Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:27:31.366 --> 00:27:36.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out in this episode
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:27:45.714 --> 00:27:47.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s worshippers

00:27:47.716 --> 00:27:50.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have long praised him with song.

00:27:50.285 --> 00:27:52.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did singing become

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a part of our modern-day worship?

00:27:55.023 --> 00:27:59.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story begins more than 150 years ago.

00:27:59.661 --> 00:28:02.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year is about 1869

00:28:02.564 --> 00:28:06.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:08.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charles Taze Russell

00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:11.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a young man
searching for Scriptural truth.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One evening he’s walking along
and hears something

00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—singing coming from a religious meeting
being held in a basement.

00:28:20.749 --> 00:28:25.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He goes in, and what he hears sparks a fire

00:28:25.053 --> 00:28:28.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bible study like never before.

00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:31.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Russell and his associates

00:28:31.159 --> 00:28:34.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make music’s role in pure worship clear

00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:37.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they rediscover Bible truth.

00:28:37.732 --> 00:28:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charles Taze Russell

00:28:39.868 --> 00:28:42.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have come to appreciate

00:28:42.036 --> 00:28:45.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the power of music can stir emotions

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:49.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a music business
that his father owned for a period of time.

00:28:49.911 --> 00:28:53.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He believed that “the singing of the truth

00:28:53.548 --> 00:28:56.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a good way to get it into the heads

00:28:56.718 --> 00:28:59.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hearts of God’s people.”

00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:03.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first issue of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower,</i>

00:29:03.558 --> 00:29:06.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published in July of 1879,

00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:08.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
announced a songbook

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the first of many to come.

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:13.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was called <i>Songs of the Bride.</i>

00:29:13.635 --> 00:29:17.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contained 144 hymns,

00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:20.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or religious songs of praise.

00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students sang
at their meetings and assemblies.

00:29:24.112 --> 00:29:29.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it like to sing
these songs back in the early 1900’s?

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that you’re
at one of Charles Taze Russell’s lectures. 

00:29:33.888 --> 00:29:38.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you walk in,
you’re handed a small sheet of paper.

00:29:38.259 --> 00:29:41.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look for a seat, but it’s packed.

00:29:41.262 --> 00:29:43.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the crowd quiets down,

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:48.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they announce that the meeting
will start with a song and prayer.

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:52.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a church,
you expect to find a hymn book in your pew,

00:29:52.173 --> 00:29:54.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is a rented hall.

00:29:54.642 --> 00:29:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you realize
that the paper you were handed

00:29:57.912 --> 00:29:59.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has the song lyrics,

00:29:59.948 --> 00:30:03.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it also has a place
to leave your name and address

00:30:03.685 --> 00:30:05.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’d like a Bible study.

00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the audience
starts to sing, you join in.

00:30:10.758 --> 00:30:14.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did songs sound like back then?

00:30:14.162 --> 00:30:19.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s listen to a song
we sang for over eight decades.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a recording from 1916.

00:30:28.877 --> 00:30:30.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a little different than how

00:30:30.945 --> 00:30:32.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our songs sound today.

00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:36.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compare different versions of this song,

00:30:36.384 --> 00:30:38.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll notice that the lyrics

00:30:38.386 --> 00:30:41.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theme changed over the years.

00:30:41.022 --> 00:30:43.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a version of “All Hail”

00:30:43.658 --> 00:30:47.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Watch Tower Male Quartet in 1935.

00:30:59.374 --> 00:31:02.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first songbook this song was called

00:31:02.076 --> 00:31:04.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,”

00:31:04.846 --> 00:31:06.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was about, well,

00:31:06.848 --> 00:31:08.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of Jesus’ name

00:31:08.883 --> 00:31:11.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with zero mention of Jehovah.

00:31:11.386 --> 00:31:14.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, many songs prior to this

00:31:14.355 --> 00:31:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were adapted from existing church hymns.

00:31:17.926 --> 00:31:21.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s the same song in 1950.

00:31:21.362 --> 00:31:23.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of the lyrics

00:31:23.164 --> 00:31:25.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overemphasizing Jesus’ name,

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:29.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lyrics refer to “making known God’s will”

00:31:29.504 --> 00:31:32.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mention Jehovah by name.

00:31:37.912 --> 00:31:40.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why all the changes?

00:31:40.381 --> 00:31:42.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our songs reflect

00:31:42.884 --> 00:31:46.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our current understanding
of Scriptural truth.

00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:48.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the light gets brighter,

00:31:48.423 --> 00:31:50.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we understand the truth more clearly,

00:31:50.959 --> 00:31:53.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the songs change.

00:31:53.895 --> 00:31:55.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first songbook explained

00:31:55.763 --> 00:31:57.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explained the goal to publish 

00:31:57.465 --> 00:32:01.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“songs free from objectionable theology,”

00:32:01.736 --> 00:32:05.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s been the case ever since.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:07.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t hold on to songs

00:32:07.742 --> 00:32:10.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for tradition or nostalgia.

00:32:10.478 --> 00:32:14.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sing them because it’s the truth!

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:18.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the 1928 songbook onward,

00:32:18.219 --> 00:32:20.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a big shift.

00:32:20.254 --> 00:32:23.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many songs were written
by our brothers and sisters.

00:32:23.658 --> 00:32:27.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They put more emphasis on Jehovah’s name,

00:32:27.395 --> 00:32:30.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his attributes, and his Kingdom.

00:32:30.098 --> 00:32:32.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can even tell by the title 

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:35.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Songs of Praise to Jehovah.</i>

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the songs might even sound familiar,

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this one.

00:32:52.186 --> 00:32:54.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are your parents in the truth?

00:32:54.188 --> 00:32:55.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your grandparents?

00:32:55.757 --> 00:32:57.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even your great-grandparents?

00:32:57.859 --> 00:33:02.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, they sang the same song as you

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at their meetings and assemblies.

00:33:04.932 --> 00:33:08.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a real legacy!

00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:11.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s fast-forward to the 1940’s.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:14.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our brothers
were imprisoned for their faith.

00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:18.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world was at war and needed good news.

00:33:18.012 --> 00:33:20.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we intensified

00:33:20.014 --> 00:33:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our preaching and teaching work.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is when
the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

00:33:24.819 --> 00:33:27.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Theocratic Ministry School started,

00:33:27.355 --> 00:33:32.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s also when
singing was reintroduced at our meetings.

00:33:33.828 --> 00:33:35.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait a minute!

00:33:35.863 --> 00:33:37.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reintroduced?

00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:41.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we stopped singing at meetings.

00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When?

00:33:43.137 --> 00:33:45.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:33:57.485 --> 00:34:00.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a cliff-hanger!

00:34:00.988 --> 00:34:03.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know

00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:07.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we stopped singing for a time?

It will be posted soon on jw.org.

00:34:15.503 --> 00:34:18.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look for future episodes

00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:34:23.244 --> 00:34:25.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many years ago,

00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:27.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Awake!</i>  magazine

00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:31.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published the story of Elizabeth Balnave.

00:34:31.586 --> 00:34:34.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth explains

00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:38.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why she made a major career decision.

00:34:38.559 --> 00:34:42.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that decision affect her life?

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:45.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out in this episode

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>Where Are They Now? </i>

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a child, I dreamed

00:34:55.743 --> 00:34:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of becoming a ballerina.

00:34:58.746 --> 00:35:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trained as a ballet dancer from childhood.

00:35:01.749 --> 00:35:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taught to give complete obedience
to the artistic director,

00:35:05.753 --> 00:35:09.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
absolute loyalty to the dance company,

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to put ballet before everything else
in my life.

00:35:14.662 --> 00:35:18.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finally realized there’s no way
to get ahead in this world

00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:21.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without compromise.

00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just can’t be done.

00:35:23.237 --> 00:35:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a life is empty and unsatisfying.

00:35:31.512 --> 00:35:34.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is, once you get into that,

00:35:34.515 --> 00:35:38.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you get lulled in by that glamour and glitz.

00:35:38.352 --> 00:35:42.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, down the road
when you finally see the trap

00:35:42.156 --> 00:35:45.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you got into,
it’s very hard to get out.

00:35:45.493 --> 00:35:48.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I always tell young people, you know,

00:35:48.429 --> 00:35:52.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it doesn’t matter how good everything
seems; it doesn’t matter how great.

00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:56.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s always a string attached—always.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one day,
you’re going to wake up and it’s a rope.

00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:03.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can’t cut a rope that easily

00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:05.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—meaning you can’t get out of the situation

00:36:05.379 --> 00:36:08.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once Satan has you trapped in it.

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:10.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it happens without you even realizing it.

00:36:11.686 --> 00:36:14.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ballet is discipline,

00:36:14.322 --> 00:36:16.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to figure out a way

00:36:16.924 --> 00:36:19.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take that skill

00:36:19.393 --> 00:36:21.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and transfer it into my everyday life.

00:36:21.329 --> 00:36:23.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took some time,
but I finally figured it out,

00:36:23.564 --> 00:36:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s not a waste.

00:36:24.832 --> 00:36:25.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good.

00:36:25.733 --> 00:36:29.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I had to learn
was to get out of my comfort zone.

00:36:31.205 --> 00:36:34.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were in Bethel until 1987.

00:36:34.542 --> 00:36:38.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jack had a job lined up when we left Bethel,
and that was good.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t get a job
because of my physical health issues.

00:36:43.417 --> 00:36:46.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I probably was in bed for about five months.

00:36:46.487 --> 00:36:49.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I started feeling better,

00:36:49.423 --> 00:36:53.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s when I realized
how bad the medical bills were getting.

00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:57.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just dragged myself out of bed
and went and looked for a part-time job.

00:36:57.598 --> 00:37:01.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, through all of this,
Jack and I just kept praying.

00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:02.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew Jehovah would take care of us.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No question about that.

00:37:04.705 --> 00:37:08.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I did get a job at a law firm.

00:37:08.509 --> 00:37:09.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a good job.

00:37:09.844 --> 00:37:12.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually lasted there 30 years.

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:14.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely Jehovah blessed me,

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:17.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I believe what he was blessing
were my efforts.

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:21.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t quit, and I refused to compromise.

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:26.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started seeing
that I was really learning this new skill

00:37:26.294 --> 00:37:28.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was getting good at it,

00:37:28.129 --> 00:37:31.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s when I sat down and I said:
“Well, Jehovah, I have this new skill.

00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:33.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be able to use it for you.”

00:37:33.534 --> 00:37:35.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing led to another, and I became

00:37:35.703 --> 00:37:38.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a commuter Bethelite
for the Legal Department.

00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:41.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d say that about 11 years
after I had left Bethel,

00:37:41.642 --> 00:37:45.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working and all of a sudden,
I got sick again with the same thing

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—complete rapid loss of weight
and all the weakness came back.

00:37:49.417 --> 00:37:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was eventually diagnosed
as having celiac disease.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once I changed my diet,
I just started getting better and better.

00:37:57.658 --> 00:38:00.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stayed with the law firm until 2014,

00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:04.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then my husband and I retired
and moved to another part of the country.

00:38:04.432 --> 00:38:08.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, currently,
I’m a remote Bethel consultant.

00:38:09.003 --> 00:38:11.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you slave for the world,
you really are a slave.

00:38:11.672 --> 00:38:13.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you slave for Jehovah,

00:38:13.674 --> 00:38:16.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my opinion, you’re not slaving at all.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You couldn’t have a better partnership

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than you and Jehovah,
and that’s how I view it.

00:38:23.684 --> 00:38:27.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re never going to experience
Jehovah to the full

00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:30.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless you put yourself out there
for him to use.

00:38:30.191 --> 00:38:33.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had a wonderful life

00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:36.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of extraordinary spiritual privileges.

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no career in the world
that is ever going to come close to that.

00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:51.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t you say that resilience

00:38:51.312 --> 00:38:55.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one of the qualities
that has helped Elizabeth?

00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:58.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can each of us do

00:38:58.486 --> 00:39:01.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be more resilient?

00:39:01.856 --> 00:39:04.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice three practical suggestions

00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:09.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this morning worship presented
by Brother Gajus Glockentin.

00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:15.770 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Mary kept listening to what Jesus was saying.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How commendable!

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:19.774 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
She set the right priorities

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:22.209 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and is a good example for us.

00:39:22.209 --> 00:39:24.545 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Martha, her sister, however,

00:39:24.545 --> 00:39:26.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received loving correction from Jesus,

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our printed comment puts it.

00:39:29.483 --> 00:39:34.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us, today, put ourselves
in the shoes of Martha for a moment.

00:39:34.488 --> 00:39:38.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed great interest in supporting Jesus

00:39:38.592 --> 00:39:42.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by providing him a base during his ministry

00:39:42.363 --> 00:39:44.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the difficult area of Judea.

00:39:44.865 --> 00:39:46.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this time,

00:39:46.867 --> 00:39:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary and Martha
were probably working together

00:39:50.071 --> 00:39:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare things for Jesus.

00:39:52.406 --> 00:39:57.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after Jesus arrived,
Mary stopped helping as our text indicates.

00:39:57.344 --> 00:40:00.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Martha feel about it?

00:40:00.381 --> 00:40:04.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now she had to care for everything herself.

00:40:04.118 --> 00:40:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we imagine the tension rising

00:40:07.455 --> 00:40:09.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within Martha’s heart?

00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:12.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stress level is increased,

00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:16.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her dear sister
sits and listens to Jesus.

00:40:18.032 --> 00:40:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she asked Jesus to correct Mary,

00:40:21.435 --> 00:40:24.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to order her back to work.

00:40:24.238 --> 00:40:29.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to her surprise, she, Martha,
received counsel from Jesus.

00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:32.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would we feel in such a situation?

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are doing something well-intentioned

00:40:35.416 --> 00:40:39.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, yet, instead of commendation,
we receive counsel.

00:40:39.954 --> 00:40:43.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe our eyes filled with tears.

00:40:43.657 --> 00:40:46.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel the pain in our chest.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might think we can’t breathe anymore.

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:53.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Martha think for a moment,
replying to Jesus, saying:

00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:55.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not fair!

00:40:55.202 --> 00:40:57.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am doing everything to support you,
and now this.

00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:00.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You know, from now on,
I am listening too,

00:41:00.674 --> 00:41:04.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am curious to find out
who prepares the meals for you.”

00:41:07.615 --> 00:41:12.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we don’t know
what Martha thought and said.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know,
as our printed comment puts it,

00:41:16.423 --> 00:41:20.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took to heart Jesus’ loving correction.

00:41:20.427 --> 00:41:24.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us
to overcome such a painful moment

00:41:24.165 --> 00:41:26.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to progress?

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The term often used in this connection

00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:31.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “resilience.”

00:41:31.405 --> 00:41:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who are resilient
are able to recover easily and quickly

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from unpleasant and damaging events.

00:41:39.146 --> 00:41:43.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is like the ability of this piece of metal

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tolerate pressure

00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:48.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go back to its original form.

00:41:50.224 --> 00:41:54.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, therefore,
look at three factors that make us resilient

00:41:54.795 --> 00:41:58.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and different from those
who easily give up and surrender.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first factor is facing reality

00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:07.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—facing reality.

00:42:07.174 --> 00:42:10.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, please,
open to Proverbs chapter 28.

00:42:10.678 --> 00:42:15.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question we are asking ourselves
in a difficult moment is this:

00:42:15.482 --> 00:42:20.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I truly understand and accept
the reality of my situation?’

00:42:21.255 --> 00:42:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, at Proverbs 28:26,

00:42:24.892 --> 00:42:27.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it starts by saying:

00:42:27.828 --> 00:42:31.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever trusts in his own heart

00:42:31.765 --> 00:42:34.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stupid.”

00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:38.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might tend to put on emotional blinders

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see only what we want to see.

00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:45.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people slip into denial
as a coping mechanism.

00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:50.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the Proverb continues
in the second part, saying:

00:42:50.317 --> 00:42:54.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the one who walks in wisdom

00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:56.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will escape.”

00:42:56.357 --> 00:43:01.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means seeing things the way they are.

00:43:01.362 --> 00:43:04.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Facing reality

00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:07.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really facing reality is grueling work.

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:10.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, it can be unpleasant

00:43:10.104 --> 00:43:13.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often emotionally wrenching.

00:43:13.507 --> 00:43:16.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter had this experience

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:21.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus looked at him
after Peter had denied him three times.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:24.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter faced reality, went outside,

00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:27.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broke down, and wept bitterly.

00:43:27.588 --> 00:43:31.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For sure, he was not looking for any excuses.

00:43:31.158 --> 00:43:35.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience, as well as other situations
where he received counsel,

00:43:35.763 --> 00:43:40.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped him to make progress
and to fulfill his assignments even better.

00:43:41.635 --> 00:43:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is the second factor?

00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:48.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We call it “meaning-making.”

00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:52.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might know people who
under pressure threw up their hands

00:43:52.813 --> 00:43:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cried and said,
“Why is this happening to me?”

00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:00.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such people see themselves as victims,

00:44:00.354 --> 00:44:04.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and living through hardship
does not teach them any lessons.

00:44:05.626 --> 00:44:08.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We, however,
based on our Bible knowledge,

00:44:08.028 --> 00:44:11.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understand why difficulties
and challenging situations

00:44:11.332 --> 00:44:13.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sometimes unavoidable.

00:44:13.634 --> 00:44:17.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing the bigger picture adds meaning.

00:44:17.805 --> 00:44:20.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This helps us, as a resilient person,

00:44:20.107 --> 00:44:24.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to endure
an unpleasant situation or a new circumstance

00:44:24.445 --> 00:44:28.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to look at seeming obstacles

00:44:28.015 --> 00:44:32.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see an opportunity in it.

00:44:32.186 --> 00:44:36.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know that no one is perfect.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone fails at something sometime.

00:44:40.527 --> 00:44:45.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our choice
is the manner in which we respond.

00:44:45.366 --> 00:44:49.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are actively trying
to make the best out of it,

00:44:49.803 --> 00:44:53.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking ahead rather than behind,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
setting goals
—maybe new goals.

00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might remember how Brother Harold King

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed this resilient disposition

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:04.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was in solitary confinement.

00:45:04.685 --> 00:45:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he give meaning
to his difficult situation

00:45:08.422 --> 00:45:10.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making the best out of it?

00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:12.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I arranged
for a program of ‘preaching’ activity.

00:45:16.864 --> 00:45:21.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But to whom does one preach
when in solitary confinement?

00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:25.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I decided that I would build up
some appropriate Bible sermons

00:45:25.339 --> 00:45:27.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the things I could remember

00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:31.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then preach to imaginary characters.”

00:45:33.046 --> 00:45:35.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in our context, we can say

00:45:35.516 --> 00:45:38.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning-making is like building a bridge

00:45:38.952 --> 00:45:42.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from present day hardships
to a better future.

00:45:42.189 --> 00:45:44.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of this bridge,

00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we make a difficult situation manageable.

00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:52.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remove the sense
that the present is overwhelming.

00:45:53.967 --> 00:45:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at the third factor:

00:45:56.804 --> 00:46:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a balanced view of ourselves.

00:46:00.808 --> 00:46:04.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we said at the beginning
that we have to face reality

00:46:04.278 --> 00:46:07.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can go along with feelings
of sadness and disappointment.

00:46:07.614 --> 00:46:09.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As resilient people,

00:46:09.616 --> 00:46:11.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t take a failure

00:46:11.685 --> 00:46:15.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a challenging situation personally.

00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:19.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, please, open to Romans chapter 7,

00:46:19.393 --> 00:46:21.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we want to demonstrate this point

00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:25.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of the example of the apostle Paul.

00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:30.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times,
he felt discouraged over his weaknesses.

00:46:30.437 --> 00:46:32.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in chapter 7,

00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:35.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he describes the pain of conscience

00:46:35.175 --> 00:46:40.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he suffered
because of feeling captive to sin.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in verse 24,

00:46:43.517 --> 00:46:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cries out, saying:

00:46:45.853 --> 00:46:48.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Miserable man that I am!”

00:46:51.258 --> 00:46:55.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidently, though, Paul realized

00:46:55.028 --> 00:46:59.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his imperfection did not define him.

00:46:59.032 --> 00:47:01.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nine years later,

00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:04.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his second letter to his friend Timothy,

00:47:04.805 --> 00:47:06.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly before his death,

00:47:06.807 --> 00:47:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he stated
his personal conclusion of the matter

00:47:10.177 --> 00:47:14.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at 2 Timothy 4:7.

00:47:14.815 --> 00:47:17.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:47:17.384 --> 00:47:21.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have fought the fine fight,

00:47:21.989 --> 00:47:26.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have run the race to the finish,

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have observed the faith.”

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:36.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s problems and inner struggle
did not miraculously disappear.

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:39.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, it did not prevent him

00:47:39.139 --> 00:47:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from accomplishing
remarkable things in Jehovah’s service.

00:47:43.744 --> 00:47:46.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, therefore, we do not berate ourselves

00:47:46.313 --> 00:47:48.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with self-defeating language,

00:47:48.315 --> 00:47:50.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as “I’m a failure”

00:47:50.984 --> 00:47:54.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “I’m useless.”

00:47:54.021 --> 00:47:57.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on positive aspects of our lives

00:47:57.324 --> 00:47:59.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflecting on our strengths

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to maintain
a balanced view of ourselves.

00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:06.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in conclusion,

00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:10.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the experience of Martha reminded us today

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the importance of building

00:48:12.773 --> 00:48:15.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintaining resilience

00:48:15.342 --> 00:48:18.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

meaning-making,

00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintaining a balanced view of ourselves.

00:48:26.853 --> 00:48:30.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains wonderful descriptions

00:48:30.857 --> 00:48:34.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how life will be in Paradise.

00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:37.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our new music video shows,

00:48:37.864 --> 00:48:40.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visualizing these future blessings

00:48:40.968 --> 00:48:43.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings joy to our heart.

00:48:55.882 --> 00:49:06.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I close my eyes, and I can see
A world of peace, love, and harmony.

00:49:06.059 --> 00:49:11.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come with me,
And you’ll see.

00:49:11.164 --> 00:49:13.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see.

00:49:18.138 --> 00:49:27.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a dream, as I’m sure you know.
These things God promised so long ago

00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:32.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are guaranteed,
Sure to be.

00:49:32.986 --> 00:49:35.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see.

00:49:39.693 --> 00:49:50.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look around—
There’s joy and laughter in ev’ry sound.

00:49:50.671 --> 00:50:01.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look and see—
This is the way our God meant it to be.

00:50:01.815 --> 00:50:11.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who fell asleep along the way,
They live again; we see them ev’ry day.

00:50:11.658 --> 00:50:16.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come with me,
And you’ll see.

00:50:16.863 --> 00:50:19.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see.

00:50:48.161 --> 00:50:57.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pain and crying there used to be
Has gone forever; now it’s history.

00:50:57.771 --> 00:51:02.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come with me,
And you’ll see.

00:51:02.843 --> 00:51:05.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see.

00:51:10.484 --> 00:51:20.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look around—
There’s joy and laughter in ev’ry sound.

00:51:20.761 --> 00:51:31.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look and see—
This is the way our God meant it to be.

00:51:31.838 --> 00:51:42.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s word is enough for me.
With eyes of faith, it’s reality.

00:51:42.015 --> 00:51:49.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we see
What’s in store,

00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:57.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be sure
Until the moon is no more,

00:51:57.864 --> 00:52:00.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you—

00:52:00.767 --> 00:52:10.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Close your eyes and come with me
To God’s world of peace and harmony.

00:52:10.777 --> 00:52:16.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come with me,
And you’ll see.

00:52:16.016 --> 00:52:21.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see.

00:52:27.294 --> 00:52:31.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful song and video!

00:52:31.198 --> 00:52:33.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our program,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we looked back at theocratic history,

00:52:36.136 --> 00:52:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be nostalgic, but to remind us

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:45.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
continually improves his organization,

00:52:45.045 --> 00:52:47.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he promised.

00:52:47.314 --> 00:52:50.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We debuted an exciting new series,

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:54.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Our History in Motion,</i>

00:52:54.387 --> 00:52:59.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saw the essential role
that singing plays in our worship.

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:00.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned

00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:03.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah blesses those

00:53:03.496 --> 00:53:05.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve him.

00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:06.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth gave up

00:53:06.566 --> 00:53:09.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a glamorous career

00:53:09.402 --> 00:53:11.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but gained spiritual treasures.

00:53:11.071 --> 00:53:13.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we saw that although John

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has experienced many difficulties,

00:53:16.142 --> 00:53:18.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has helped him

00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:21.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain his joy by helping others.

00:53:21.982 --> 00:53:25.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we conclude,

00:53:25.118 --> 00:53:29.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s enjoy our video postcard.

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:31.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month,

00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:35.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we visit our brothers in Ecuador.

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As its name suggests,

00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:42.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecuador is situated on earth’s equator.

00:53:42.535 --> 00:53:45.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stretches from the Galapagos Islands

00:53:45.138 --> 00:53:47.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Andes Mountains

00:53:47.841 --> 00:53:50.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Amazon River basin.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:54.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Mount Chimborazo.

00:53:54.014 --> 00:53:56.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Measured from the center of the earth,

00:53:56.049 --> 00:53:58.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s the highest point on our planet

00:53:58.485 --> 00:54:01.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the bulging
of the earth at its equator.

00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:06.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This train line was carved
into the Andes more than a century ago.

00:54:06.526 --> 00:54:09.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was used by the first missionaries

00:54:09.696 --> 00:54:12.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who arrived in 1946.

00:54:12.098 --> 00:54:16.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, more than 100,000

00:54:16.102 --> 00:54:18.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses
proclaim the good news in Ecuador.

00:54:19.539 --> 00:54:24.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nearly 300,000 people
attended the Memorial in 2020.

00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:27.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Chontapunta Quichua Congregation

00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:30.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began as an isolated group.

00:54:30.216 --> 00:54:33.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To support themselves,
our brothers raise flowers

00:54:33.153 --> 00:54:35.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even pan for gold.

00:54:35.755 --> 00:54:39.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But their zeal is for the ministry.

00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:43.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They go to great lengths
to bear thorough witness in their territory.

00:54:43.797 --> 00:54:46.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where bridges aren’t available,
they find a way.

00:54:46.399 --> 00:54:49.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They use two boats, named Enoc

00:54:49.269 --> 00:54:54.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Enoc 2, to reach remote
Quichua-speaking communities.

00:54:54.307 --> 00:54:57.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remote communities
have poor cellular service.

00:54:57.644 --> 00:55:00.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t stop this Bible student.

00:55:00.113 --> 00:55:02.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look what he does to get a good signal

00:55:02.682 --> 00:55:05.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he can join meetings and have his study.

00:55:05.218 --> 00:55:08.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach those without cellular service,

00:55:08.421 --> 00:55:11.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers use a high-frequency radio

00:55:11.091 --> 00:55:14.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conduct return visits and Bible studies.

00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:19.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers have arranged for talks
and the Memorial to be given in Waorani,

00:55:19.132 --> 00:55:21.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an indigenous language
that’s not yet translated.

00:55:21.868 --> 00:55:25.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This little girl, whose family
is part of the congregation,

00:55:25.538 --> 00:55:28.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shares videos with Waorani-speaking children.

00:55:28.975 --> 00:55:31.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is four years old!

00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:35.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dear brothers and sisters

00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:38.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Chontapunta Quichua Congregation
in Ecuador

00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:41.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their love and greetings

00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:43.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:55:45.158 --> 00:55:47.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leon, my friend,

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to thank you so very much
for helping out with this program.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciated the help.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And together, we send all of you
our warm Christian love.

00:55:58.605 --> 00:56:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:05.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
