Hey, Javi.

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben.
How are you doing?

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:08.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
How’s the job going?

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, the machine is running great!

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I did have a question
on the specs for the Harrison job.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we take a quick look?

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, let’s see here.

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Need a hand?

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:18.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m good.
I just . . .

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened, guys?

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got—we got to do something!

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, disconnect . . .

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
Yeah, yeah, get it going.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dead

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I’m pretty sure it’s dead.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would just say that it stopped working.

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you do,
don’t tell Victor what happened.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just got this set up last month.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would it just stop working?

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could happen.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you can actually smell

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the coffee.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to Victor.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t throw yourself under the bus, Man!

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll help you get this cleaned up.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will have to know.

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of the most expensive
units in the shop.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you take the blame,

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re just making yourself look bad.

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
It’s OK.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a mistake.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll explain it.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to get this back online.

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:12.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I think Victor
actually appreciated my honesty.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wasn’t the only one.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark had some questions,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a great discussion.
