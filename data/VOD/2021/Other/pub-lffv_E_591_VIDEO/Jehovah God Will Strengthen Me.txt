00:00:06 I was imprisoned for a year and three months
00:00:09 for upholding Christian neutrality.
00:00:12 I was in a cell with all types of hardened criminals.
00:00:16 I was sitting at home.
00:00:18 My whole family had been arrested.
00:00:22 They burned down the villages.
00:00:25 We had to go live in the bush.
00:00:28 That was difficult because we had a baby.
00:00:32 The police came in with guns,
00:00:37 pointed them at us and handcuffed us,
00:00:41 searched all our house, took everything away,
00:00:45 and took us to the detention center.
00:00:48 And that was the beginning of our imprisonment.
00:00:51 I was taken to prison
00:00:54 all alone and scared,
00:00:56 but I trusted in Jehovah
00:00:59 —that only he could protect me.
00:01:03 During that entire time, what helped me was the thought
00:01:06 that Jehovah God would strengthen me
00:01:08 and that he was by my side.
00:01:10 Every day, I would review all those scriptures
00:01:13 in my mind and go over them;
00:01:15 that was the first thing I did in the day.
00:01:17 So never at any time, although I didn’t have a Bible,
00:01:22 did I feel any spiritual loss or weakness.
00:01:26 During the difficult moments with the baby,
00:01:29 we always prayed to Jehovah.
00:01:31 I saw Jehovah as my Father, as a real Person.
00:01:38 It was like I was hearing  Jehovah’s voice saying to me:
00:01:42 “My daughter, don’t worry. I am with you!”
00:01:46 So I never shrunk back.
00:01:48 I remained firm!
00:01:51 If I had valued myself, my freedom,
00:01:54 my health, or material gain
00:01:56 more than my relationship with Jehovah,
00:01:58 I might not have chosen to serve him.
00:02:01 But because I loved Jehovah more than all these things,
00:02:05 I was able to choose Jehovah
00:02:07 even if that meant that I had to serve time in prison.
00:02:12 Now I can freely serve God,
00:02:14 attend religious meetings,
00:02:18 and go in the ministry with my family.
00:02:21 I felt that Jehovah’s hand was with me
00:02:25 and that fear disappeared.
00:02:28 The one who gave me so much strength was Jehovah.
00:02:34 If you love Jehovah, love has no fear;
00:02:38 love banishes fear.
00:02:40 And I can only say that my life,
00:02:43 despite everything, has been pleasant,
00:02:45 and I’ve been so happy.
00:02:48 In fact, there have been so many occasions
00:02:50 when it’s been positive joy.
00:02:53 So I feel that that is because I’ve always kept Jehovah
00:02:57 right in front of my mind,
00:02:59 and I’m confident
00:03:01 that brothers and sisters who do the same
00:03:04 will find Jehovah will bless them
00:03:06 as he’s blessed me.
00:03:08 The fact that Jehovah
00:03:10 will never forget the loyalty that we show him
00:03:12 and the hope of Paradise that he has given us
00:03:15 help me to feel his love,
00:03:17 overcome my fear,
00:03:19 and become determined to serve him loyally forever.
