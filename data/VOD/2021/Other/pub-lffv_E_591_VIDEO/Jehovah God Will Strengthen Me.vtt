00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:09.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was imprisoned
for a year and three months

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for upholding Christian neutrality.

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in a cell
with all types of hardened criminals.

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was sitting at home.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My whole family had been arrested.

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They burned down the villages.

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to go live in the bush.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was difficult because we had a baby.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The police came in with guns,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pointed them at us and handcuffed us,

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
searched all our house, took everything away,

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took us to the detention center.

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the beginning of our imprisonment.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken to prison

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all alone and scared,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I trusted in Jehovah

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that only he could protect me.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that entire time,
what helped me was the thought

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God would strengthen me

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was by my side.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day,
I would review all those scriptures

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my mind and go over them;

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was the first thing I did in the day.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never at any time,
although I didn’t have a Bible,

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did I feel any spiritual loss or weakness.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the difficult moments with the baby,

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we always prayed to Jehovah.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Jehovah as my Father, as a real Person.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like I was hearing 
Jehovah’s voice saying to me:

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My daughter, don’t worry. I am with you!”

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I never shrunk back.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remained firm!

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I had valued myself, my freedom,

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my health, or material gain

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than my relationship with Jehovah,

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might not have chosen to serve him.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because I loved Jehovah
more than all these things,

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to choose Jehovah

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if that meant
that I had to serve time in prison.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I can freely serve God,

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:18.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attend religious meetings,

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:21.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go in the ministry with my family.

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:25.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that Jehovah’s hand was with me

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:28.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that fear disappeared.

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The one who gave me
so much strength was Jehovah.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you love Jehovah, love has no fear;

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love banishes fear.

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can only say that my life,

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:45.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite everything, has been pleasant,

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:48.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been so happy.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, there have been so many occasions

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it’s been positive joy.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I feel that
that is because I’ve always kept Jehovah

00:02:57.656 --> 00:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right in front of my mind,

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:01.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m confident

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brothers and sisters who do the same

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will find Jehovah will bless them

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he’s blessed me.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that Jehovah

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will never forget the loyalty that we show him

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hope of Paradise that he has given us

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help me to feel his love,

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcome my fear,

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become determined
to serve him loyally forever.
