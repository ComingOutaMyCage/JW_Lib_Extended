00:00:11 Nearly all religions teach
00:00:13 that part of a person survives death.
00:00:17 But what does the Bible teach?
00:00:20 God created the first man, Adam, from the dust.
00:00:24 He had the opportunity to live forever.
00:00:28 But when he deliberately disobeyed God,
00:00:31 he was told that he would return to the dust
00:00:34 —ceasing to exist.
00:00:38 What about others who died after Adam?
00:00:41 When Jesus was told that his friend Lazarus died,
00:00:45 Jesus did not say that Lazarus had gone to heaven.
00:00:48 Rather, he said:
00:00:50 “Our friend has fallen asleep.”
00:00:53 What did he mean?
00:00:58 Just as someone in a deep sleep
00:01:01 is inactive and unaware of his surroundings,
00:01:05 the dead are not conscious of anything at all.
