Nearly all religions teach

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that part of a person survives death.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does the Bible teach?

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God created the first man, Adam,
from the dust.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the opportunity to live forever.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he deliberately disobeyed God,

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was told that he would return to the dust

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.100 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—ceasing to exist.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about others who died after Adam?

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was told
that his friend Lazarus died,

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not say
that Lazarus had gone to heaven.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.571 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he said:

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.198 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Our friend has fallen asleep.”

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he mean?

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as someone in a deep sleep

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is inactive and unaware
of his surroundings,

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dead are not conscious
of anything at all.
