The more you study,

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:08.696 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
the more you understand Jehovah.

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
The more you understand Jehovah,

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.241 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
the more you love him.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Jehovah clearly tells us:

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.203 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“My thoughts are not your thoughts.”

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
So if we want to understand 
Jehovah’s thinking better,

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.916 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
we need to dig deep in our study,

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and then we share those thoughts with others.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Personal study is like fuel

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
that keeps you going.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Personally, I’m not a good student,

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.431 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
but I really learned how to study the Bible.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
The Bible came alive during Gilead.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Self-discipline is involved 
—very much.

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I overcome the tiredness aspect

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.405 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
of Bible study by not doing it

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
at a time of day 
when I know I’m going to be tired.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I can be tired for other things later on 
—but not for that.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Each session of my Bible study 
begins with a prayer,

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.420 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“Please help me recognize 
it is counsel for me,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and then give me the strength 
to work on it.”

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I have a color-coded system,

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
so I know what certain things stand for.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I have a particular color

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:22.102 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
for Jehovah’s good hand in people’s lives;

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I have another color for warning examples;

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I have another for fine examples to imitate.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
You have to get behind the information,

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
not just focus on one verse or one chapter.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
See who’s involved, the time,

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
the conditions, how many people are there,

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and then you’ll get 
the true meaning of the verse.

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
John 1:1,

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:01.725 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
who is “the Word”?

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
We can go to verse 18.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“Begotten” meant

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
he had a beginning, 
a time when he started

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
—when he began—

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
in heaven with his Father.

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
That’s where he was.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Philippians 4:6, 7 is a scripture 
that I’ve read many times over.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“The peace of God that excels all thought.”

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
OK, how do you get that?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
It’s from having 
a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
How is it that God’s peace 
‘guards your heart’?

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“By means of Christ Jesus” our Lord.

00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
And I said: “Why by Jesus?

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“Because Jesus paid the ransom;

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
that ransom is what makes possible 
a relationship with Jehovah.”

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
So it almost goes full circle.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.845 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I attended a School for Congregation Elders

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:24.016 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
that had Gilead graduates as instructors.

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.977 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
One of the methods is to analyze

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:30.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
a certain Bible account 
from different perspectives.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
We can’t see 
the whole picture from one angle.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I share my research results 
with Bible students,

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and that helps them 
to know Jehovah better,

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and it helps them to see 
that what they’re studying

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:44.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
is of practical value.

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I had studied up on Jacob;

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
he wrestled all night

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:51.460 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
with an angel.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
And I wanted to share it 
with some of my friends.

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:59.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
One of the brothers 
that happened to sit around

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
when this discussion was going on 
came back to me, and he said to me:

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“I had concluded my arrangements

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“to quit full-time service.

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
“But after listening to that discussion,

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I’ve decided that I’m no longer stopping.”

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
And that was 
such a wonderful moment for me.

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:23.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I thanked Jehovah.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
When I learned that I 
was going to become a mom,

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.123 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I said, “Jehovah, if this little one

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:32.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
could love you, 
then I’ll get to keep him forever.”

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:35.963 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
And I began to teach everything 
I was learning to him.

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:39.216 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
So it’s a matter

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
of keeping my faith strong,

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:43.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and there’s no shortcut.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:47.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Every session of study 
that is properly done with good meditation

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:49.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
adds a new pillar

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
to the strength of our faith.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
I look forward to those times 
when I can, you know,

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
run upstairs by myself 
and just shut everything off,

00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:01.905 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
and it’s just me and Jehovah.

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
Life today is very unpredictable,

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
but I’ve come to see that as long as I 
keep a tight grip on God’s Word,

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
nothing can “separate [me] from God’s love.”
