00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.921 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You and I make a lot of decisions every day.

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.657 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, some have a little impact on our lives;

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:10.360 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
others have a very big impact.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can appreciate that we can make
choices and decisions for ourselves.

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of how life would be
if you made no decisions for yourself

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—someone tells you when to go to bed,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:25.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they pick out your clothes,
and they tell you what to do for work.

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:28.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, none of us would like that!

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:31.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave each of us free will,

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the precious gift
of making choices for ourselves.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, have you ever thought
about why Jehovah gave us this gift?

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, why trust us with free will

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he knew that we could make
bad choices or decisions?

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:49.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one powerful reason is love.

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:52.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only way to give us the gift of love

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:55.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also to give us the gift of free will.

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two are tied together.

00:00:57.407 --> 00:01:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You really can’t have one without the other.

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if I programmed my computer

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:07.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give me a message every day at 2:00 p.m.:
“John, I love you.

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’re a wonderful guy,”

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:12.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think there’d be
a little something wrong with me

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I thought: ‘Aw, isn’t that nice?

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My computer, it loves me.’

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, love only exists

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:22.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it comes truly
from a free-will expression.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:28.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Jehovah place any boundaries
on free will?

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were stated in the Law
to the nation of Israel.

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:34.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus later repeated them

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 22:37-40:

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:44.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to him:
‘“You must love Jehovah your God

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and with your whole mind.”

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is the greatest and first commandment.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The second, like it, is this:

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You must love your neighbor as yourself.”

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘On these two commandments
the whole Law hangs,

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:04.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Prophets.’”

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our use of free will

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has love of God and love of neighbor
as its boundaries.

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, for example, what people are doing
in this picture,

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both inside the circle boundary

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and outside.

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:24.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, free will allows us
to do any of the things

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see in the picture.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But love of God and love of neighbor

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move us to reject what’s outside the circle

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:36.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and choose to do the kinds of things
that we see inside the circle.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to stay within those boundaries,

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us a marvelous brain

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a built-in conscience,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also knows we need more help.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why he also gave us
Bible principles

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—basic truths from the Bible

00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:55.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to make good decisions.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it can safely be said
that any decision we face

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be guided by Bible principles.

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our Creator, Jehovah,
knows what’s best for us.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he also trusts us to make decisions

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on Bible principles

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:13.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he knows that when we do that,

00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:17.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re really, truly going to be happy,
content,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at peace with him and with others.

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review so far:
Jehovah gave us free will

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:28.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s the privilege
to make choices for ourselves—

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he also gave us Bible principles

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the boundaries to our choices.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But making difficult decisions requires
that we train ourselves

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recognize Bible principles and apply them.

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:49.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s read Romans 12:1,

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s see how this verse describes

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the decision-making process.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, I appeal to you

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:00.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the compassions of God, brothers,

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to present your bodies
as a living sacrifice,

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“holy and acceptable to God,

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:08.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a sacred service

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:12.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your power of reason.”

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:16.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So are we using our “power of reason”

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand Bible principles?

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:24.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, young children
ask lots of questions.

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But has a child ever asked you:
“What happens when I drop a ball?

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pencil? a book?”

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they don’t ask that.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:35.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They know what happens to anything they drop.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It falls down!

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, the child doesn’t need rules
for every object

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but has quickly grasped the principle.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:47.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anything he drops falls down.

00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:50.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what if an 18-year-old asked you,

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:54.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What’s going to happen
when I drop this pen?”

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s obvious
he’s not been paying attention

00:04:57.046 --> 00:05:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to basic principles of life.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by us paying attention
to Bible principles,

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can very quickly see the pattern

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of love of God and love of neighbor

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and know the right thing to do

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without a long list of rules
for every situation.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we train our “power of reason”?

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We train it by paying attention

00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read and study the Bible.

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t need rules
for which movies to watch,

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which songs to listen to,

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what clothes we can wear.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re paying attention
when we’re reading the Bible,

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:43.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we train our conscience with Bible principles

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can make such decisions
without needing a long list of rules.
