Just as a person can be awakened
from a deep sleep,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:09.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible shows that it is possible
to be awakened from death.

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:12.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did just that

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.743 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for his friend Lazarus.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lazarus had been dead for four days.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If some part of Lazarus

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had survived his death and gone to heaven,

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:29.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would Jesus take him out of heaven

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and force him to live on earth again?

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lazarus was asleep in the grave.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave him back his life

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reunited him with his family.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible promises a time

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when many people
will be resurrected from the dead,

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:50.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Lazarus was.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke of this wonderful hope
when he said:

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:58.037 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“The one who exercises faith in me,

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:00.039 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“even though he dies,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.249 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will come to life.”
