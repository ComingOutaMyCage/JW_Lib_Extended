No doubt every one of us
at one time or another

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has faced a discouraging situation.

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:12.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Really, no one is immune

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from discouragement.

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:15.999 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This feeling may last

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a day or two and then subside,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it might last longer.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:26.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can cause us to be discouraged?

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Watch Tower Publications Index </i>

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lists over 20 factors

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can contribute to discouragement.

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are these:

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another’s conduct

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what someone did or didn’t do

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that disappointed us;

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
problems in our congregation;

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feeling inadequate;

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our own personal failures

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what we’ve done or failed to do;

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
health problems; and loss of privileges.

00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are ever so many things

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:03.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can cause us to be downhearted.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the fact that we are discouraged
can be discouraging.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel guilty for being discouraged.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the good news.

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in good company.

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some very prominent
and faithful servants of Jehovah

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned in the Bible have been discouraged.

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses became so discouraged

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the complaints of the Israelites

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:35.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he said to God:
“Please kill me right now.”

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebekah was so distressed

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:42.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because her son Esau married pagan women

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she told her husband, Isaac:

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am disgusted with my life.”

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, family situations

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:54.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause discouragement.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was tormented by his sins.

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 51:3, he wrote:

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am well-aware of my transgressions,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sin is always before me.”

00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our mistakes can weigh us down.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah felt so discouraged

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the opposition, ridicule,
and apathy he met up with

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he told himself:

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am not going to make mention of [Jehovah],

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:32.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will speak no more in his name.”

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, poor results in the ministry
can discourage us.

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul frankly admitted

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 7:24, 25

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he struggled against sinful tendencies.

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:53.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times,
he felt miserable over this conflict.

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Miserable man that I am!

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:01.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will rescue me
from the body undergoing this death?”

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithful men and women

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced discouraging circumstances in the past,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so do we.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discouragement is a part of life
in this system.

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:20.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should expect it.

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, it’s important to consider

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we view discouragement.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:31.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we view ourselves
as helpless victims of discouragement

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:34.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let ourselves sink into a quagmire

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of despair and self-pity,

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or do we view discouragement
as an enemy

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must fight against?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We easily recognize that feelings of pride,

00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
selfishness, envy,
and such things are enemies.

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:55.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We battle against these bad feelings.

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want them to erode our faith

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or gain a foothold in our personality.

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:06.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, sometimes we may yield all too willingly

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discouragement.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is this dangerous?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:16.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me Proverbs 24:10:

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:19.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you become discouraged

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the day of distress,

00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:25.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your strength will be meager.”

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:29.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the reason why
we must fight discouragement?

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Proverbs 24:10
tells us will happen

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:38.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we allow a “day of distress”
to discourage us?

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll lose our strength.

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, discouragement can drain us

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our spiritual, mental, emotional,
and even physical strength.

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:55.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can happen if we lose our strength?

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:58.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can lose our enthusiasm for the truth.

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:03.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may lose interest in prayer
or in personal study.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could slack off in attending meetings.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could develop coldness
toward our brothers.

00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our zeal for evangelizing can weaken.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:18.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may even want to give up.

00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:23.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want any of those things
to happen to us, do we, brothers?

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How, then, do we fight
and defeat discouragement?

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discouragement is a feeling, an emotion.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What causes feelings or emotions?

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An article entitled “Negative Emotions
—Can You Overcome Them?”

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was published
in the October 8, 1992, <i>Awake!</i>

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This article didn’t discuss
serious cases of depression

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may have a medical or physical cause,

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as a disease,

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a reaction to toxins, medications,

00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:07.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nutritional deficiencies,

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:10.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allergens, hormonal problems,

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bipolar disorder.

00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:16.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it discussed how to overcome

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moments of discouragement

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:21.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the temporary “day of distress”

00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned at Proverbs 24:10.

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the subheading
“We Can Control Our Thinking,”

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it stated this:

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many who work in the field of mental health

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“maintain that our feelings

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:42.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are caused by our thoughts.”

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:47.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said
that ‘you cannot experience a feeling

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without first experiencing a thought.’

00:06:51.928 --> 00:06:55.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, feeling discouraged

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:58.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t always the situation that we face

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:02.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the negative thoughts
that we have about the situation.

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first step, then,
in fighting discouragement

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to identify the negative thoughts.

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:17.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we say
that we have a “train of thought.”

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means we have a series of thoughts

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lead to a certain conclusion,
or destination, if you will.

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine yourself

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting on a literal railroad
or subway train.

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon you realize
that you’re on the wrong train.

00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:39.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s taking you to a place
you do not want to go to.

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do?

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you stay on the train
all the way to the wrong destination?

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:47.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:07:47.683 --> 00:07:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you get off that train
at the very next station.

00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:55.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do you do next?

00:07:55.424 --> 00:07:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You switch to the right train.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, figuratively speaking,

00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:05.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you realize
that your mind is getting on

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a train of negative thoughts
that are leading to discouragement,

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you get off that train?

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly.

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you need to switch
to the right train of thought

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will lead you
to a peaceful state of mind.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the key.

00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to replace negative thoughts

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:29.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with positive, upbuilding,
spiritual thoughts.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping our thinking on the right track

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an ongoing process.

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul put it

00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:43.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ephesians 4:23:

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see how Paul confirms
that we are in control?

00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:00.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can change how we think.

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because we’re imperfect,

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to make these changes continuously.

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:08.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a losing battle.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us powerful weapons

00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:15.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us make our minds
move in the right direction

00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:17.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his powerful Word,

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his mighty holy spirit,

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of prayer,

00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and healthful spiritual food
from his organization.

00:09:27.516 --> 00:09:30.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some negative thoughts

00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:33.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may lead to discouragement.

00:09:33.522 --> 00:09:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we’ll consider
upbuilding, positive thoughts

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help us fight discouragement.

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had a bad day.

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said or did the wrong thing,
and you regret it.

00:09:48.237 --> 00:09:52.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s become a “day of distress.”

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:56.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought enters your mind,
‘I’m worthless.’

00:09:56.779 --> 00:10:00.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the “discouragement train.”

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you continue to stay
on this train of thought,

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:06.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking you to the state of discouragement?

00:10:07.423 --> 00:10:10.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you have a choice.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can reject it.

00:10:12.928 --> 00:10:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of giving in
to that negative thought,

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:18.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say to yourself:

00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wait a minute. Stop!

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s not right.

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:25.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just because I made a mistake

00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘does not make me worthless
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s told us that he knows
that “we are dust”

00:10:32.915 --> 00:10:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and that he’s merciful.

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And Jesus said that “not one sparrow

00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that has fallen to the ground
is forgotten by God,”

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and that “[we] are worth more
than many sparrows.”

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Yes, Jehovah views me as precious.

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll pray about this,

00:10:55.604 --> 00:11:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and I’m sure he’ll help me
not to make that mistake again.

00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:03.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Tomorrow will be a better day.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.’

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a second example.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:15.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother has said something
quite unkind to you.

00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has become a “day of distress.”

00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought comes to your mind:

00:11:22.064 --> 00:11:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can a brother behave like that

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and still be in good standing?

00:11:28.037 --> 00:11:31.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s not a good example.

00:11:31.474 --> 00:11:34.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t the elders do something about it?’

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s discouragement speaking,

00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:41.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling for us to “get on board.”

00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:44.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we stay on that negative train of thought,

00:11:44.587 --> 00:11:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could lose our spiritual strength.

00:11:48.524 --> 00:11:52.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we still have a choice.

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:55.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will we replace those negative thoughts

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:58.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with positive ones?

00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:01.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could get our mind on a positive track

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by saying to ourselves something like this:

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, that was an unkind thing
for him to say.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is not like him.

00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:17.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe my brother just had a bad day.

00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s as imperfect as I am.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve said unkind things too, at times,

00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:26.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and have regretted it.

00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:29.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s probably feeling the same way.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I remember Colossians 3:13 says

00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:37.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that we must “continue putting up
with one another

00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“and forgiving one another freely

00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:45.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“even if anyone has
a cause for complaint

00:12:45.147 --> 00:12:47.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘against another.”

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:52.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, he has given me a cause for complaint.

00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But it says Jehovah
has “freely [forgiven us].”

00:12:59.128 --> 00:13:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He has certainly forgiven me
countless times.

00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:06.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No, I am not going to allow this

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:09.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to ruin our relationship.

00:13:09.738 --> 00:13:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I help my brother?

00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll pray for him.

00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:16.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And I’ll pray for myself

00:13:16.612 --> 00:13:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I don’t hold feelings of resentment

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my heart.’

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:25.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a third example.

00:13:25.988 --> 00:13:30.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After years of hard work
at your place of employment,

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your position has been terminated.

00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:34.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve lost your job.

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a “day of distress.”

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re filled
with anxious, negative thoughts:

00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:43.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How will I care for my family?

00:13:43.172 --> 00:13:45.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What will the future bring?

00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:49.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to me?’

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where will this train
of dark, negative thoughts lead you?

00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, discouragement will set in,

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:04.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will become
spiritually weak and exhausted.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You still have a choice.

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can replace those negative thoughts

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with thoughts such as these:

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:16.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘OK, I’ve lost my job.

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What should I do?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Stop serving Jehovah?

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:21.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No!

00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jesus said that we should not be anxious
over material things

‘because Jehovah will provide

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if we keep his Kingdom first in our lives.

‘So that’s what we’ll do

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:49.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—simplify our life
and do more in Jehovah’s service.

00:14:49.038 --> 00:14:52.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah promises never to abandon us.

00:14:52.441 --> 00:14:55.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll throw my burden on him,

00:14:55.444 --> 00:15:00.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know he’ll help us
make the right decisions.’

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, we’re living

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last days of this system of things.

00:15:06.956 --> 00:15:10.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll have our days of distress.

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:14.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes these come
because of our own imperfection

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the imperfection of others.

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also realize

00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Devil wants to discourage us.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 12:17 tells us

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:30.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan’s great anger is directed

00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:34.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward those
“who observe the commandments of God

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:39.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the work
of bearing witness concerning Jesus.”

00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:42.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil will try to take advantage

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of situations and problems that we face

00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fill us with discouraging thoughts
and drain us of our strength.

00:15:52.635 --> 00:15:57.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we stand
at the very threshold of the new world.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s fight discouragement

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:03.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the weapons Jehovah gives us.

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to study God’s Word,

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:09.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making it a part of your daily life.

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:14.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray incessantly to Jehovah
for his powerful spirit.

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:17.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep close to his organization.

00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:22.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has promised to give us the victory.

00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:27.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fearlessly, we join in repeating Paul’s words

00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:31.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:13:

00:16:31.006 --> 00:16:35.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

through the one who gives me power.”
