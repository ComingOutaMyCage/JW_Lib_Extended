Jehovah loves people,

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:05.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also holds us accountable

00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:07.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our actions.

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:09.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feel

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:11.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
about those who claim to worship him

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
but betray him by their conduct?

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:16.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will he determine

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:18.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
who survives the great tribulation?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why will Jehovah, a God of love,

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:23.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
execute millions of people?

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:26.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those questions are answered in section 4

00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:27.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>Pure Worship</i>  book.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on Ezekiel 39:25, it’s entitled

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I Will Zealously Defend My Holy Name.”

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
The depth of Jehovah’s feelings
is vividly conveyed

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:39.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the first chapter of this section.

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:42.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has the title

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I Will Bring an End to Your Prostitution.”

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
That title is drawn from Ezekiel 16:41:

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will burn your houses with fire

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:54.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and execute judgment on you

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“before the eyes of many women;

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will bring an end to your prostitution,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will stop giving payment.”

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you study this chapter,

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for these key points:

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it reasonable

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
to compare false religion to a prostitute?

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do the prostitutes

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:17.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Ezekiel chapters 16 and 23

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
teach us about Jehovah’s feelings

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding false worship?

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lies ahead for false religion,

00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:27.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what action should we take now?

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:30.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so comforting to know

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:33.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
has a strong emotional attachment

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:35.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who serve him!

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:38.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that special relationship brings with it

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:40.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
a serious responsibility.

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:44.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never would we want
to hurt Jehovah’s feelings!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
May this chapter strengthen your resolve

00:01:49.212 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give Jehovah the pure worship

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:54.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that rightly belongs only to him.
