Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this special edition
of JW Broadcasting®

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
originating from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:28.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our programs this month and next

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will feature the entire
regional convention program for 2021.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body
and all the brothers and sisters working here

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters,

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s my pleasure
to welcome you to the convention.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year’s convention has the theme

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Powerful by Faith!”

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme scripture for today’s program

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Luke 17:5:

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin this first session
with the music-video presentation.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the video,
notice how Jehovah’s people show faith

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reaching out in his service

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how parents
can help their children to build faith.

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:26.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are delighted that you 
could join us for this opening session

00:10:26.313 --> 00:10:30.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “Powerful by Faith!”
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing together song number 5,

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “God’s Wondrous Works.”

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:39.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 5.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is faith,
and why is it essential for us to have it?

00:13:13.063 --> 00:13:15.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson,

00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:20.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will answer these questions in the talk

00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:22.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How Powerful Is Faith?”

00:13:29.287 --> 00:13:31.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters:

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:36.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this 2021 “Powerful by Faith!”

00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:42.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me begin by extending to all of you

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:46.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the warm Christian love and greetings
from the Governing Body

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the United States Bethel family.

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:54.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me assure you
that we continue to pray on your behalf.

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:57.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Powerful by Faith!”

00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:01.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what a motivating
and what an encouraging theme

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:03.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this convention!

00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we going to learn?

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re going to concentrate

00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:11.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on answering three questions
at this convention.

00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:15.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is, What is faith?

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:19.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second one is, What can faith do for us?

00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:23.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the third is, How can we build our faith?

00:14:24.634 --> 00:14:28.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s appropriate, since this is
the introduction to the convention,

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:30.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to spend some time

00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:33.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about each one of those questions.

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:36.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s begin with that first question:

00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:38.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is faith?

00:14:38.523 --> 00:14:40.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers and sisters, we know

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faith is something that is produced
in us by God’s holy spirit.

00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:48.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Galatians chapter 5 says

00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:52.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faith is a part
of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.

00:14:52.537 --> 00:14:56.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we have God’s spirit,
we will have faith.

00:14:56.791 --> 00:15:00.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what exactly is faith?

00:15:00.253 --> 00:15:02.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go in our Bibles.

00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see the definition the Bible gives

00:15:04.674 --> 00:15:07.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 11:1.

00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:09.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you read it with me?

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:12.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:1 says:

00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the evident demonstration of realities

00:15:21.274 --> 00:15:23.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not seen.”

00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:28.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice that the definition
of faith is given in two parts.

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:30.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the first part?

00:15:30.617 --> 00:15:35.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first, it says:
“Faith is the assured expectation

00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:37.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is hoped for.”

00:15:37.499 --> 00:15:39.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:15:39.793 --> 00:15:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, faith is the conviction

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:46.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will have the things
that we hope for.

00:15:46.257 --> 00:15:48.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we could illustrate it this way:

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:52.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it’s like the conviction we have
when we go to bed at night

00:15:52.138 --> 00:15:55.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that the sun is going to rise
in the morning.

00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:58.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the conviction that the farmer has
when he sows his seed

00:15:58.978 --> 00:16:03.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that those seeds are going to sprout
and they’re going to grow.

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:07.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith makes future things promised by God

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:12.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as real as if we already have them now.

00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that the person with faith

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:20.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
firmly believes that everything
that Jehovah says is true

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:24.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that all of the promises
that Jehovah has made

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to come to reality.

00:16:28.424 --> 00:16:31.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s the second part
of that definition?

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is “the evident demonstration

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:37.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of realities that are not seen.”

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:38.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:16:38.852 --> 00:16:40.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe we could illustrate it
with something simple like this cell phone.

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:50.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have a cell phone
and you have cell phone service,

00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:54.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then wherever you may be on the earth,
I could call you right now.

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, there are no wires
attached to this phone.

00:16:58.037 --> 00:17:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could that possibly work?

00:17:00.623 --> 00:17:03.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, we know that this technology

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relies on radio waves.

00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:09.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you and I can’t see radio waves,

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:12.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but every time we make a call
on our cell phones,

00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:17.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see the evidence,
or the “evident demonstration,”

00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:19.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that radio waves are real,

00:17:19.767 --> 00:17:22.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we cannot see them.

00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:24.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:26.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we really have faith,

00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it means that we can believe in something

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is verified by strong evidence,

00:17:33.072 --> 00:17:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it is unseen.

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that means that faith
as described in the Bible

00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:44.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not unquestioning; it is not irrational;

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:46.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is not foolish or gullible;

00:17:46.753 --> 00:17:49.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not being quick to believe something

00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:52.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with little or no evidence.

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:54.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True faith comes

00:17:54.135 --> 00:17:58.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a careful analysis and study

00:17:58.264 --> 00:18:01.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s precious Word, the Bible.

00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:05.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The accurate knowledge
that we gain from God’s Word

00:18:05.146 --> 00:18:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to build our faith.

00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:11.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s there in the Bible
that we learn about God,

00:18:11.361 --> 00:18:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn about his name,

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:17.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn about his promises
that have already come true,

00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we learn about promises that he’s made

00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—exciting promises for our future.

00:18:23.831 --> 00:18:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But faith is also built and established
by something else.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:31.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s creation.

00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:33.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look up into the night sky

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:37.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see the exact order in the universe,

00:18:37.053 --> 00:18:39.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how does it make us feel?

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when we look at the human brain
and its complexity

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the complexity of the human eye,

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to come to the conclusion

00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:50.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there must be a Designer.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is strong evidence

00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:56.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an intelligent Creator.

00:18:56.614 --> 00:18:58.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now,

00:18:58.324 --> 00:19:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why is it so important that you and I

00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:04.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grow in our faith and develop faith?

00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible answers that question too.

00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:11.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you look with me at Hebrews 11:6?

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:6, it says:

00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:18.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, without faith it is impossible

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[isn’t that interesting? it is impossible]

00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to please God well,

00:19:23.182 --> 00:19:28.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God
must believe that he is

00:19:28.187 --> 00:19:33.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he becomes the rewarder
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:19:33.192 --> 00:19:34.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you see the point?

00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:38.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Without faith it is impossible
to please God.”

00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So faith is essential

00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:45.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we are going to please God
and have his blessing.

00:19:45.246 --> 00:19:48.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve talked quite a bit
about what faith is,

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here are two things that faith is not.

00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is not simply believing
that God exists,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Bible says
that even ‘the demons believe in God,

00:20:00.219 --> 00:20:02.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they shudder.’

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:07.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involves coming to know Jehovah,
coming to trust him,

00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:11.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forming an unbreakable friendship with him,

00:20:11.647 --> 00:20:15.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Jehovah is so real to us

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:17.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we sense his love

00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sense his approval
in our day-to-day life.

00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:25.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the other thing that faith is not?

00:20:25.036 --> 00:20:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is not simply hoping for something.

00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:31.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible uses the example of Abraham.

00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:33.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Abraham had

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the demonstration of the things
that he hoped for;

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:40.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had evidence that God was real.

00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did that affect Abraham?

00:20:42.678 --> 00:20:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the result?

00:20:44.013 --> 00:20:46.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together this important scripture

00:20:46.808 --> 00:20:51.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 4:20.

00:20:52.396 --> 00:20:55.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 4:20, it says:

00:20:55.775 --> 00:20:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

00:20:58.653 --> 00:21:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he [that is, Abraham]

00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:04.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not waver in a lack of faith;

00:21:04.325 --> 00:21:06.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but [notice, what did he do?]

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:10.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he became powerful by his faith,

00:21:10.164 --> 00:21:12.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving God glory.”

00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:15.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Abraham was moved;

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:19.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was motivated; he was empowered.

00:21:19.173 --> 00:21:23.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He became powerful by his faith.”

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how appropriately, then,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Romans 4:20 has been chosen

00:21:30.852 --> 00:21:34.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme text for this convention.

00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:37.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in a moment, we are going to talk

00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:40.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the power of faith,

00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:43.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but before we do,
we have a wonderful treat now.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give your attention
to a recorded message

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:50.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our dear Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body,

00:21:50.663 --> 00:21:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he explains to us
how important faith is for Christians today.

00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:10.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the “Powerful by Faith!”

00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:13.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:15.313 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’ll certainly be happy

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:16.981 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you made the effort to attend

00:22:16.981 --> 00:22:19.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all three days of this convention.

00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:23.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “powerful by faith”

00:22:23.905 --> 00:22:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is drawn from the apostle Paul’s words

00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:29.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 4:20.

00:22:29.577 --> 00:22:32.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did the Governing Body choose faith

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:38.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we need strong faith

00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal successfully with our present trials

00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:45.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with those we’ll face in the near future.

00:22:45.426 --> 00:22:49.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 17:20,

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:52.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus assured his disciples:

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:55.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith

00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:57.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the size of a mustard grain,

00:22:57.772 --> 00:23:00.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will say to this mountain,

00:23:00.107 --> 00:23:04.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move,

00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:07.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:23:07.281 --> 00:23:10.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, faith enables us

00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do things we could never imagine
doing on our own.

00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:19.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Christians, faith is essential.

00:23:19.126 --> 00:23:23.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:23:23.172 --> 00:23:27.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 John 3:23, we read:

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:31.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, this is his commandment:

00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have faith

00:23:33.683 --> 00:23:36.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the name of his Son Jesus Christ

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and love one another,

00:23:38.312 --> 00:23:41.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he gave us a commandment.”

00:23:42.066 --> 00:23:46.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 11:6 tells us:

00:23:46.904 --> 00:23:48.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Without faith

00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God

00:23:53.995 --> 00:23:56.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must believe that he is

00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:23:58.541 --> 00:24:01.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, to receive Jehovah’s blessing

00:24:05.715 --> 00:24:08.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gain the reward of everlasting life,

00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:13.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to build and maintain faith.

00:24:14.348 --> 00:24:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 1:17,

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quoting the prophet Habakkuk, Paul wrote:

00:24:21.397 --> 00:24:24.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous one will live

00:24:24.108 --> 00:24:26.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reason of faith.”

00:24:26.861 --> 00:24:30.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With these words, Paul emphasized

00:24:30.072 --> 00:24:34.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will reward
all who show real faith.

00:24:34.618 --> 00:24:37.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on our faith in Jesus’ ransom,

00:24:37.121 --> 00:24:39.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah forgives our sins

00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:43.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grants us a righteous standing
with him even now.

00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:44.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during Armageddon,

00:24:44.795 --> 00:24:47.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will protect God’s people

00:24:47.757 --> 00:24:50.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then give them the opportunity

00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:53.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live forever in Paradise.

00:24:53.179 --> 00:24:56.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we want for all of you.

00:24:56.182 --> 00:24:58.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us here today

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:01.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already have a large measure of faith,

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as Paul wrote

00:25:03.022 --> 00:25:06.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 1:24:

00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:11.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is by your faith that you are standing.”

00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:14.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reports from around the globe

00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:16.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
testify to your genuine faith

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:20.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing
through you

00:25:20.706 --> 00:25:22.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your faith.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel as Paul expressed

00:25:25.378 --> 00:25:29.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Colossians 1:3, 4:

00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We always thank God,

00:25:32.468 --> 00:25:35.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:25:35.096 --> 00:25:37.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when we pray for you,

00:25:37.181 --> 00:25:40.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

00:25:40.309 --> 00:25:44.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love you have for all the holy ones.”

00:25:45.564 --> 00:25:48.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But constant pressure
from Satan and the demons,

00:25:48.901 --> 00:25:52.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the old world, and our own imperfections

00:25:52.154 --> 00:25:56.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:58.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The purpose of this convention

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:01.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strengthen that faith.

00:26:01.956 --> 00:26:04.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how to cultivate true faith,

00:26:04.917 --> 00:26:07.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to exercise it in our daily lives,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to maintain it
during difficult times.

00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:13.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please

00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:17.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay close attention
to each part of the program.

00:26:17.638 --> 00:26:21.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As scriptures are read,
follow along in the Bible.

00:26:21.892 --> 00:26:24.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may God’s Word empower you

00:26:24.728 --> 00:26:29.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a man, woman, or child of faith!

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Jackson.

00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:37.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s come back now
to the point we were discussing.

00:26:37.241 --> 00:26:41.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the power of faith?

00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:44.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, to open this discussion,
let’s open our Bibles

00:26:44.623 --> 00:26:48.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s go to Matthew chapter 17

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:51.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together verses 19 and 20.

00:26:51.922 --> 00:26:55.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Matthew 17:19, 20:

00:26:56.635 --> 00:27:00.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the disciples came to Jesus privately
and said:

00:27:00.973 --> 00:27:03.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Why could we not expel it?’

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:08.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:
‘Because of your little faith.

00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:10.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For truly I say to you,

00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:15.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:17.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will say to this mountain,

00:27:17.323 --> 00:27:20.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Move from here to there,”

00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:23.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and it will move,

00:27:23.162 --> 00:27:27.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.’”

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:27:28.626 --> 00:27:32.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that faith is powerful.

00:27:32.004 --> 00:27:36.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“Nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:27:36.842 --> 00:27:38.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as Peter

00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:41.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of his faith
was able to get out of the boat

00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:43.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walk on the water,

00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:46.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith can enable us to do things

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from a human perspective

00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:52.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seem to be completely impossible.

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:56.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider six different things.

00:27:56.028 --> 00:27:58.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first one:

00:27:58.572 --> 00:28:03.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith opens up the privilege
of being able to walk

00:28:03.536 --> 00:28:07.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our wonderful, amazing God, Jehovah.

00:28:07.706 --> 00:28:09.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:13.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible says
that men of faith like Noah

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“walked with the true God.”

00:28:15.172 --> 00:28:18.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean when it says that?

00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:23.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Noah followed
Jehovah’s commandments and instructions

00:28:23.347 --> 00:28:25.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so carefully

00:28:25.474 --> 00:28:29.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Noah loved Jehovah so much

00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was just as though Noah and Jehovah

00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:36.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were walking down the street together

00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:40.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the closest and most intimate of friends.

00:28:40.406 --> 00:28:45.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is something that faith
made possible for Noah.

00:28:45.411 --> 00:28:50.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But brothers and sisters, here’s
the really wonderful and amazing thing:

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:52.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was true for Noah,

00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also true for you,
and it’s also true for me.

00:28:57.464 --> 00:29:01.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can experience what seems impossible

00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:06.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be actually walking
with our heavenly Father day by day.

00:29:06.223 --> 00:29:09.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the power of faith.

00:29:09.101 --> 00:29:11.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at a second one:

00:29:11.937 --> 00:29:16.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moves us to obey the commands of God

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:18.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without hesitation.

00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:21.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as an example, we think of Abraham.

00:29:21.322 --> 00:29:26.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s called in the scriptures
“the father of all those having faith.”

00:29:26.827 --> 00:29:29.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how is Abraham an example?

00:29:29.246 --> 00:29:32.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was quick to obey Jehovah

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when Jehovah asked him to do things

00:29:35.044 --> 00:29:38.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were very difficult, like leaving Ur

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offering up his only son.

00:29:42.092 --> 00:29:46.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham was willing to obey
because of his faith.

00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:48.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, brothers, think

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:52.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—think about what this makes possible today.

00:29:53.187 --> 00:29:57.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who have been addicted
to drugs, to tobacco,

00:29:57.191 --> 00:30:01.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to alcohol, to gambling, to pornography;

00:30:01.654 --> 00:30:05.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who have been living
immoral lifestyles of all sorts;

00:30:05.783 --> 00:30:09.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who have said they would
never be able to give up those habits

00:30:09.703 --> 00:30:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that they would never be able
to change their lifestyle—

00:30:12.748 --> 00:30:14.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened?

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:16.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they developed faith,

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:20.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through their faith and through their desire
to please Jehovah,

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:24.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they broke free from all of those things.

00:30:24.843 --> 00:30:27.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have seen people like that.

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:29.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have seen them.
I have seen them.

00:30:29.556 --> 00:30:32.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that people like this

00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:35.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have conquered all of these bad things

00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:37.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their faith.

00:30:37.564 --> 00:30:41.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you are one of those people.

00:30:41.068 --> 00:30:43.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is the real power of faith

00:30:46.615 --> 00:30:50.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not something theoretical,
not something imagined,

00:30:50.202 --> 00:30:52.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in action.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:55.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People experience that power

00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:57.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own lives.

00:30:57.918 --> 00:31:00.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to the third one:

00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:03.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in the fulfillment
of Jehovah’s promises

00:31:03.674 --> 00:31:08.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moves us to want to go out
and preach the good news of God’s Kingdom.

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:11.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, let’s read
what the Scriptures say about this.

00:31:11.306 --> 00:31:16.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 4:13,

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:19.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says there:

00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now because we have the same spirit of faith

00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as that of which it is written:

00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:27.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I exercised faith,

00:31:27.531 --> 00:31:29.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“therefore I spoke’;

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we too exercise faith

00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:35.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and therefore we speak.”

00:31:35.414 --> 00:31:37.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does it mean?

00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:42.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without faith, without exercising faith
in the promises of God,

00:31:42.504 --> 00:31:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never ever be able to do
the preaching work.

00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:50.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, maybe when you were first studying
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:31:50.846 --> 00:31:55.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe you said something like this:
‘I’ll never go from door to door.

00:31:55.768 --> 00:32:00.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll never see me walking down the street,
knocking on doors.’

00:32:00.147 --> 00:32:02.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:04.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you grew in your faith,

00:32:04.735 --> 00:32:07.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you wanted to share
the things that you were learning

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you wanted to talk
about all the wonderful things

00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:13.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you were hearing about Jehovah.

00:32:13.327 --> 00:32:16.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, faith helps us conquer our fears.

00:32:16.622 --> 00:32:18.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us overcome shyness.

00:32:18.624 --> 00:32:22.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us overcome indifference
in the territory.

00:32:22.503 --> 00:32:25.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us overcome opposition

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even government bans.

00:32:27.716 --> 00:32:30.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hitler, Stalin,

00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:33.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union, and even Russia today

00:32:33.597 --> 00:32:38.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of them have said that they
would crush Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:42.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they would put an end
to our preaching.

00:32:42.648 --> 00:32:44.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:48.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters kept on preaching

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite whatever opposition came,

00:32:51.323 --> 00:32:53.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers today

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:56.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are living
under similar circumstances under ban

00:32:56.453 --> 00:32:58.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue preaching also.

00:32:58.789 --> 00:33:01.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not give up.

00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:02.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:05.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are they able to keep going?

00:33:05.128 --> 00:33:08.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the power of faith.

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moves them to action

00:33:11.552 --> 00:33:14.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to continue telling the good news,

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:16.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what the circumstances may be.

00:33:17.766 --> 00:33:19.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go on to the fourth point:

00:33:20.936 --> 00:33:24.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our faith moves us to act in ways

00:33:24.565 --> 00:33:26.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that bring blessings to us.

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:28.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about this:

00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:31.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people who saw and heard

00:33:31.613 --> 00:33:33.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the teaching of Jesus and his works

00:33:33.949 --> 00:33:36.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put faith in him.

00:33:36.243 --> 00:33:40.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They believed that Jesus
was able to heal them,

00:33:40.455 --> 00:33:43.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so that faith led to blessings.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in what way?

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes when Jesus
healed individuals, what did he say?

00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:53.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Your faith has made you well.”

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, if those people

00:33:55.846 --> 00:33:58.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had not exercised faith in Jesus,

00:33:58.473 --> 00:34:00.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would not have come to him

00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:02.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would never have experienced

00:34:02.686 --> 00:34:05.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the healing that he gave them.

00:34:05.814 --> 00:34:07.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:12.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we are not looking
to be physically healed

00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:14.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through our faith in Jesus,

00:34:14.531 --> 00:34:18.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many of us have made major decisions

00:34:18.493 --> 00:34:21.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—made major changes in our lives—

00:34:21.163 --> 00:34:24.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to become disciples of Christ.

00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:28.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we left promising careers;
perhaps we left fame;

00:34:28.795 --> 00:34:33.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps we gave up higher education,
or whatever it may be.

00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:37.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is the promise
that Jesus made to all of us

00:34:37.846 --> 00:34:41.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have made these decisions
based on faith?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Mark 10:29, look what Jesus said:

00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:50.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one has left house

00:34:50.484 --> 00:34:53.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or brothers or sisters

00:34:53.403 --> 00:34:56.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or mother or father or children

00:34:56.615 --> 00:35:00.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or fields for my sake
and for the sake of the good news

00:35:00.994 --> 00:35:05.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who will not get 100 times more

00:35:05.874 --> 00:35:08.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“now in this period of time

00:35:09.753 --> 00:35:13.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—houses, brothers, sisters,

00:35:13.048 --> 00:35:15.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“mothers, children, and fields,

00:35:15.968 --> 00:35:18.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with persecutions—

00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:21.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the coming system of things,
everlasting life.”

00:35:21.932 --> 00:35:23.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:35:23.725 --> 00:35:25.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we’ve made these decisions.

00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:28.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have walked away
from many things in the world,

00:35:28.855 --> 00:35:32.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by putting faith in Christ Jesus,

00:35:32.025 --> 00:35:36.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what amazing blessings have come to us,
just like Jesus said

00:35:36.697 --> 00:35:41.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“100 times more”
than what we have given up!

00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:44.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the power of faith.

00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:46.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at number five:

00:35:47.457 --> 00:35:50.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith helps us to win our struggle

00:35:50.544 --> 00:35:54.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the superhuman spirit forces.

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, how so?

00:35:56.466 --> 00:35:59.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Ephesians 6

00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:04.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 16.

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:09.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ephesians 6:16,

00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:12.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Besides all of this,

00:36:12.607 --> 00:36:16.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“take up the large shield of faith,

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:19.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with which you will be able to extinguish

00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:23.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the wicked one’s burning arrows.”

00:36:23.076 --> 00:36:25.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what is the point?

00:36:25.537 --> 00:36:28.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that here
in Ephesians chapter 6,

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:32.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith is compared to a “large shield”?

00:36:32.044 --> 00:36:36.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a large shield
that covers most of the body,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith in Jehovah God
and his promises for the future

00:36:41.303 --> 00:36:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can shield us from
—what does it say in verse 16?—

00:36:45.474 --> 00:36:50.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the wicked one’s burning arrows.”

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be completely protected.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:36:55.442 --> 00:36:59.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that through our faith,
we have the power

00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get up and turn off that television.

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the power to walk out
of that movie theater.

00:37:06.536 --> 00:37:11.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the power to unplug
that computer, if necessary,

00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:15.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get rid of those temptations or bad ideas

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:20.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could motivate us to enter
into a course of wrongdoing.

00:37:20.175 --> 00:37:25.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is no wonder that 1 Thessalonians 5:8

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compares faith to a “breastplate”

00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:30.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can protect our figurative heart

00:37:30.977 --> 00:37:34.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from temptation and from the power of sin.

00:37:34.648 --> 00:37:38.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is real power.

00:37:38.485 --> 00:37:40.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s go to our sixth point:

00:37:41.863 --> 00:37:44.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moves us to trust

00:37:44.449 --> 00:37:48.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our prayers to Jehovah God are heard

00:37:48.537 --> 00:37:50.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah will answer them

00:37:50.789 --> 00:37:53.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are in harmony with his will.

00:37:53.625 --> 00:37:55.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jesus said.

00:37:55.627 --> 00:37:57.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you read it with me?

00:37:57.087 --> 00:38:01.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Mark 11:24.

00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:06.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “This is why I tell you,

00:38:06.805 --> 00:38:10.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the things you pray and ask for,

00:38:10.433 --> 00:38:13.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have faith that you have received them,

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will have them.”

00:38:17.649 --> 00:38:20.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers, when we have that faith

00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:23.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the things we are asking Jehovah,

00:38:23.405 --> 00:38:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s hearing us and he’s listening to us,

00:38:26.616 --> 00:38:30.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially during these troubled times
—in the midst of this pandemic—

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we have many anxieties and concerns.

00:38:33.373 --> 00:38:36.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful that we can believe

00:38:36.209 --> 00:38:38.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God is hearing us

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he is going to provide
an answer to us,

00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:46.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just exactly in harmony with what we need!

00:38:46.011 --> 00:38:48.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after considering

00:38:48.597 --> 00:38:51.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these six different factors,

00:38:51.516 --> 00:38:56.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t you agree with me
that faith is powerful?

00:38:56.146 --> 00:38:58.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has real power

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make things that seem impossible to men

00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:06.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become realities for those
who have faith in Jehovah.

00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:11.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how thankful we can be
that Jehovah is helping us

00:39:11.995 --> 00:39:15.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop this wonderful quality

00:39:15.165 --> 00:39:17.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through solid evidence,

00:39:17.334 --> 00:39:19.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through accurate knowledge,

00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:23.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through his precious holy spirit!

00:39:23.548 --> 00:39:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that brings us to that third question:

00:39:26.843 --> 00:39:29.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we build up our faith?

00:39:29.554 --> 00:39:32.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe more specifically,
How is this convention

00:39:32.933 --> 00:39:35.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going to help us to build our faith?

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:38.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the convention
is going to include many talks,

00:39:38.772 --> 00:39:40.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symposiums, interviews,

00:39:40.982 --> 00:39:43.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to have
a two-part Bible drama.

00:39:43.777 --> 00:39:47.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is much to look forward to.

00:39:47.197 --> 00:39:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe just for a few minutes,

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:51.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you open up your program,
perhaps on your device

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like I’m using here today?

00:39:53.995 --> 00:39:56.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s consider some of the highlights

00:39:56.957 --> 00:40:00.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can expect to see in our convention.

00:40:00.293 --> 00:40:03.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ll notice that on day one,

00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the theme for the day is from Luke 17:5:

00:40:07.217 --> 00:40:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:40:10.053 --> 00:40:14.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to strengthen
your relationship with Jehovah?

00:40:14.099 --> 00:40:17.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, pay attention
to the dramatic Bible reading.

00:40:17.394 --> 00:40:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where we’re going to learn
about how faith

00:40:21.064 --> 00:40:24.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved Noah to be able to obey Jehovah,

00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though the things Jehovah
asked of him were very, very large.

00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:32.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take notice of that audio drama.

00:40:32.784 --> 00:40:34.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the afternoon—

00:40:34.786 --> 00:40:38.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a person
that loves Jehovah’s creation?

00:40:38.123 --> 00:40:40.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the second symposium of our convention,

00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:44.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith,”

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to show us how Jehovah’s love,

00:40:46.965 --> 00:40:49.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wisdom, and his power

00:40:49.134 --> 00:40:52.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are reflected in all the beautiful things
that he made.

00:40:52.595 --> 00:40:54.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to show us also

00:40:54.723 --> 00:40:58.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah not only has the ability
but the desire

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:01.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill his promises for the future.

00:41:02.147 --> 00:41:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then how about this?

00:41:03.773 --> 00:41:06.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How strong is your faith?

00:41:06.693 --> 00:41:10.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, take notice of the final talk
on Friday afternoon.

00:41:10.071 --> 00:41:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where we’re going to hear the talk

00:41:12.157 --> 00:41:16.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Keep Testing Whether You Are in the Faith’
—How?”

00:41:16.536 --> 00:41:19.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll give us an opportunity
to look at our own faith

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:22.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see just how strong it is.

00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:25.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to day two.

00:41:25.295 --> 00:41:29.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we see that the theme for the day
is going to be Jude 3:

00:41:29.174 --> 00:41:32.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith.”

00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:36.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you begun to use
our new study publication,

00:41:36.222 --> 00:41:38.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>?

00:41:38.683 --> 00:41:41.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll all want
to listen carefully to the talk

00:41:41.686 --> 00:41:45.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Build Faith Using <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>”

00:41:45.398 --> 00:41:49.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s going to discuss
how we can use this new study publication

00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the heart of our student

00:41:51.988 --> 00:41:56.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to help our student to build faith.

00:41:57.619 --> 00:41:59.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within Jehovah’s organization,

00:41:59.746 --> 00:42:04.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have many brothers and sisters
who have unbelieving mates,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have many who are part
of single-parent families,

00:42:07.587 --> 00:42:10.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have many who are single.

00:42:11.049 --> 00:42:13.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The symposium entitled

00:42:13.093 --> 00:42:16.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith”

00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:19.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to show us what we can learn

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:21.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these faithful Christians.

00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:23.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take note!

00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:25.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then looking in the afternoon,

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although we can’t travel right now,

00:42:28.316 --> 00:42:32.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to have the opportunity
to go on an around-the-world tour

00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the video
<i>How Our Brothers Are Showing Faith in . . .</i>

00:42:35.698 --> 00:42:38.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to take us all around the world

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show us how our brothers
are manifesting faith

00:42:42.122 --> 00:42:45.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in many, many different parts
of this beautiful earth.

00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:50.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you are all in for an amazing treat

00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:53.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Part I of the Bible drama

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:42:56.261 --> 00:42:59.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I think I can say confidently

00:42:59.514 --> 00:43:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is absolutely the best drama

00:43:03.226 --> 00:43:05.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have ever produced.

00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:07.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are going to love it!

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the last talk on day two
is a serious one.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to contrast faith destroyers
with faith builders,

00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:19.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s going to show us
how we can strengthen our trust

00:43:19.325 --> 00:43:24.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s Word
and also in his organization.

00:43:24.122 --> 00:43:26.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, finally, on day three,

00:43:26.249 --> 00:43:29.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our theme is going to be Matthew 21:21:

00:43:29.836 --> 00:43:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to look at what we can learn

00:43:35.925 --> 00:43:39.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from faithful women of God.

00:43:39.012 --> 00:43:42.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice,
there is an eight-part symposium

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:47.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that shows us how the women
featured in each talk showed faith

00:43:47.312 --> 00:43:51.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also how we can imitate their faith.

00:43:51.149 --> 00:43:54.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the afternoon,
we have the thrilling finale

00:43:54.652 --> 00:43:59.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that Bible drama
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:43:59.365 --> 00:44:03.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, then, the convention
will conclude all too soon

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the very motivating and moving talk

00:44:06.664 --> 00:44:10.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become Powerful by Your Faith!”

00:44:10.543 --> 00:44:12.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers, would you like to see

00:44:12.545 --> 00:44:14.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a taste of what’s in store

00:44:14.797 --> 00:44:16.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of the videos
we’re going to be seeing?

00:44:16.841 --> 00:44:18.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:44:20.345 --> 00:44:23.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:44:23.556 --> 00:44:25.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:44:26.142 --> 00:44:30.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:35.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:37.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:44:40.198 --> 00:44:43.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:44:43.576 --> 00:44:44.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But

00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:47.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:44:49.207 --> 00:44:51.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really want fear of man to stop me

00:44:51.668 --> 00:44:53.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from becoming Jesus’ disciple?

00:44:54.504 --> 00:44:57.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if a veil had been lifted
from my eyes.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment

00:44:59.884 --> 00:45:02.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:45:03.054 --> 00:45:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my darkest times,

00:45:05.682 --> 00:45:08.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:10.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew these words

00:45:10.853 --> 00:45:12.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would build my faith.

00:45:14.315 --> 00:45:16.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:18.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do what is good.”

00:45:21.531 --> 00:45:25.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, doesn’t that whet your appetite
for what is coming at this convention?

00:45:25.743 --> 00:45:30.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep in mind that some of the videos
at the convention present real accounts,

00:45:30.498 --> 00:45:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many others are just dramatizations.

00:45:33.543 --> 00:45:35.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:45:35.545 --> 00:45:39.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the dramatizations don’t portray
real people or real events,

00:45:39.966 --> 00:45:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they depict situations
that help to teach us the truth.

00:45:46.014 --> 00:45:49.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God loves and appreciates

00:45:49.225 --> 00:45:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
men and women of faith

00:45:51.227 --> 00:45:54.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—men and women just like you.

00:45:54.606 --> 00:45:58.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is determined to reward
men and women like that

00:45:58.401 --> 00:46:00.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an amazing reward.

00:46:00.403 --> 00:46:01.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you read it with me?

00:46:01.613 --> 00:46:05.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at John 6:40.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 6:40, it says:

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:12.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is the will of my Father,

00:46:12.415 --> 00:46:16.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that everyone who recognizes the Son

00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and exercises faith in him

00:46:18.254 --> 00:46:21.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“should have everlasting life,

00:46:21.883 --> 00:46:26.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will resurrect him on the last day.”

00:46:26.304 --> 00:46:29.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those “[exercising] faith”

00:46:29.223 --> 00:46:32.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be certain of receiving this reward.

00:46:32.393 --> 00:46:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 3:36, Jesus said:

00:46:35.605 --> 00:46:38.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who exercises faith in the Son

00:46:38.816 --> 00:46:43.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has [has] everlasting life.”

00:46:43.696 --> 00:46:46.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So dear brothers and sisters,

00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:49.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we begin this wonderful convention,

00:46:49.535 --> 00:46:53.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please be determined to take notes.

00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:55.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be determined to meditate

00:46:55.875 --> 00:46:58.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the things that you will hear

00:46:58.044 --> 00:47:01.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may cultivate, maintain,

00:47:01.673 --> 00:47:04.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen your faith.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, you too will become

00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:10.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
powerful by faith

00:47:10.098 --> 00:47:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and receive the wonderful, amazing reward

00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:15.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everlasting life!

00:47:17.855 --> 00:47:20.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Sanderson,
for laying a foundation

00:47:20.775 --> 00:47:23.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the program parts to follow.

00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:27.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident that each session
will help us strengthen our faith.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Real faith is based on evidence.

00:47:31.744 --> 00:47:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first symposium of this convention,

00:47:34.163 --> 00:47:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will examine evidence
that provides the basis for our faith.

00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:40.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Schafer,

00:47:40.503 --> 00:47:43.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching
Committee of the Governing Body,

00:47:43.548 --> 00:47:45.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will begin with the talk

00:47:45.883 --> 00:47:50.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Existence.”

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will then introduce
the one to follow.

00:48:00.273 --> 00:48:04.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does something exist
because you believe it does?

00:48:04.944 --> 00:48:09.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does something not exist
simply because you don’t believe in it?

00:48:09.699 --> 00:48:10.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:48:10.825 --> 00:48:13.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truth is based on evidence.

00:48:13.786 --> 00:48:18.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what kind of evidence convinces you
that something exists?

00:48:18.624 --> 00:48:21.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We believe in many things we can’t see

00:48:21.627 --> 00:48:25.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—air, wind, atoms, electricity,
gravity, time.

00:48:25.548 --> 00:48:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we believe in things we can’t hear

00:48:28.176 --> 00:48:32.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—galaxies, dog whistles, microorganisms.

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:35.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also believe in things we can’t feel,

00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:39.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as our brain
or the rotation of the earth.

00:48:39.353 --> 00:48:40.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:48:40.938 --> 00:48:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What convinces you?

00:48:43.566 --> 00:48:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The effects
—effects that you can see, hear,

00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:51.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel, and measure—

00:48:51.115 --> 00:48:54.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the testimony
from those who know the facts.

00:48:54.619 --> 00:48:59.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidence
—evidence is the basis for faith.

00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:05.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many people don’t believe
that God exists.

00:49:05.588 --> 00:49:07.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their lack of faith can affect us.

00:49:07.673 --> 00:49:10.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, our faith is under attack.

00:49:10.593 --> 00:49:14.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will remind us
of our reasons for faith

00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:17.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will help us to strengthen our faith.

00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:22.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll consider why we have faith
in God’s existence,

00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:26.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his Word, in his moral standards,

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his love.

00:49:28.694 --> 00:49:33.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, why is faith in God’s existence
important?

00:49:33.699 --> 00:49:37.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Ephesians chapter 2,

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice how the apostle Paul describes
Christians in Ephesus

00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:45.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they knew the true God.

00:49:45.837 --> 00:49:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 2:1 reads:

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Furthermore, God made you alive,

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:58.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though you were dead
in your trespasses and sins.”

00:49:58.432 --> 00:50:00.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 12 continues:

00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time you were without Christ,

00:50:04.438 --> 00:50:07.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“alienated from the state of Israel,

00:50:07.525 --> 00:50:11.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“strangers to the covenants of the promise;

00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:16.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you had no hope
and were without God in the world.”

00:50:16.534 --> 00:50:18.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same was true for us.

00:50:18.703 --> 00:50:22.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But faith in the existence of the Creator

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has given our lives meaning and purpose.

00:50:25.209 --> 00:50:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has unlocked the answers
to such questions as,

00:50:28.337 --> 00:50:33.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why does the universe exist?’
and ‘What does the future hold?’

00:50:33.301 --> 00:50:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, there are people
who shy away from such questions,

00:50:36.012 --> 00:50:39.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that the answers are just beyond us.

00:50:39.015 --> 00:50:41.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even teach that there is no purpose,

00:50:41.392 --> 00:50:44.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no ultimate meaning in life.

00:50:44.186 --> 00:50:46.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where does that leave them?

00:50:46.272 --> 00:50:49.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without reliable guidance.

00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:53.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, notice what Psalm 111:10

00:50:53.404 --> 00:50:57.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaches us about the effect of our faith.

00:50:57.658 --> 00:51:02.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 111:10 says:

00:51:02.663 --> 00:51:05.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah

00:51:05.082 --> 00:51:08.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the beginning of wisdom.

00:51:08.294 --> 00:51:10.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those observing his orders

00:51:10.838 --> 00:51:13.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“show good insight.

00:51:13.507 --> 00:51:16.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His praise endures forever.”

00:51:16.218 --> 00:51:20.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, clear thinking
and practical application of knowledge

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begin with regarding the Creator with awe

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and profound respect.

00:51:27.188 --> 00:51:29.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as indicated in the very next verse,

00:51:29.982 --> 00:51:32.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this makes us happier people.

00:51:32.485 --> 00:51:34.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we need to safeguard our faith.

00:51:34.946 --> 00:51:38.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the foundation
for our relationship with God,

00:51:38.324 --> 00:51:43.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basis for our hope,
the key to our future.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s remind ourselves

00:51:45.414 --> 00:51:49.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we can have faith in God’s existence.

00:51:49.377 --> 00:51:53.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to the chapter of the Bible
that defines faith

00:51:53.255 --> 00:51:56.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews chapter 11.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:1 tells us

00:51:59.053 --> 00:52:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faith is the convincing evidence

00:52:03.766 --> 00:52:06.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “realities that are not seen.”

00:52:06.852 --> 00:52:10.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what would be an example of that?

00:52:10.106 --> 00:52:13.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Hebrews 11:3.

00:52:15.444 --> 00:52:18.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “By faith we perceive

00:52:18.864 --> 00:52:23.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the systems of things
were put in order by God’s word,

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:27.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that what is seen has come into existence

00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:31.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from things that are not visible.”

00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:33.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The systems of things”

00:52:33.879 --> 00:52:37.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what might be some of those systems?

00:52:37.383 --> 00:52:40.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could this include our solar system

00:52:40.052 --> 00:52:42.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the galactic system that it’s a part of—

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:47.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the smaller cycles
that occur within our solar system?

00:52:47.435 --> 00:52:52.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about our earth’s atmosphere,
which protects us from the sun’s harmful rays

00:52:52.314 --> 00:52:57.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time allowing the entry
of essential heat and light.

00:52:57.194 --> 00:52:59.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think what would happen to us

00:52:59.196 --> 00:53:03.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were it not for our atmosphere’s
protective shield.

00:53:03.367 --> 00:53:05.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d burn up in seconds.

00:53:05.786 --> 00:53:09.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And besides blocking out harmful rays,

00:53:09.331 --> 00:53:12.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the atmosphere,
along with earth’s magnetic field,

00:53:12.501 --> 00:53:16.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also absorbs much of the debris
that flies through space.

00:53:16.672 --> 00:53:21.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By faith, we perceive that these “systems”

00:53:21.677 --> 00:53:24.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were put in order by God’s word.

00:53:24.972 --> 00:53:27.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or think about the earth’s amazing cycles.

00:53:27.808 --> 00:53:32.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine what would happen
if a city’s water supply

00:53:32.772 --> 00:53:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s fresh air, it’s water—

00:53:35.858 --> 00:53:39.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were disrupted and the sewers were blocked?

00:53:39.403 --> 00:53:43.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would be
the quality of life in that city?

00:53:43.365 --> 00:53:47.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, our planet is a closed system.

00:53:47.703 --> 00:53:51.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clean air and water
are not shipped in from outer space.

00:53:51.582 --> 00:53:54.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Waste matter is not rocketed out.

00:53:54.668 --> 00:53:59.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how does the earth
remain healthy and habitable?

00:53:59.381 --> 00:54:01.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The water cycle,

00:54:01.383 --> 00:54:05.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the carbon and oxygen cycles,
and the nitrogen cycle

00:54:05.304 --> 00:54:10.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are all tuned precisely to sustain life.

00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:14.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this doesn’t mean that we can be
careless stewards of our planet.

00:54:14.814 --> 00:54:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what remarkable systems!

00:54:17.233 --> 00:54:18.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And much more could be said

00:54:18.943 --> 00:54:22.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the earth’s perfect location
in our solar system

00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:25.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about the planet’s perfect orbit, tilt,

00:54:25.282 --> 00:54:28.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rotational speed, an unusual moon,

00:54:28.035 --> 00:54:32.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about our solar system’s perfect position
in the Milky Way.

00:54:32.665 --> 00:54:36.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are all of these precise locations
and elegant measurements

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:39.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the result of blind chance

00:54:39.004 --> 00:54:43.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or of purposeful design?

00:54:43.217 --> 00:54:45.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:54:45.886 --> 00:54:50.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note yet another example
of how the order evident in creation

00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:54.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly points to an all-wise Creator.

00:54:57.565 --> 00:55:01.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:55:02.987 --> 00:55:05.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, each individual cell

00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:08.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a marvel of design and organization.

00:55:09.952 --> 00:55:11.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside our cells,

00:55:11.954 --> 00:55:15.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
biological processes signal specific proteins

00:55:15.749 --> 00:55:18.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble themselves into tracks

00:55:18.127 --> 00:55:20.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called microtubules.

00:55:22.173 --> 00:55:25.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tiny molecular machines called kinesins

00:55:25.217 --> 00:55:27.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then transport various components

00:55:27.219 --> 00:55:29.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to different parts of the cell

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by “walking” along the tracks.

00:55:35.936 --> 00:55:38.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From microscopic proteins

00:55:41.901 --> 00:55:44.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enormous galaxies,

00:55:45.529 --> 00:55:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our organized universe abounds

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with examples of elegant design.

00:55:57.625 --> 00:56:02.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you strengthen your faith
in God’s existence?

00:56:02.171 --> 00:56:05.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider three things that we can do.

00:56:05.633 --> 00:56:09.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Romans chapter 1.

00:56:09.803 --> 00:56:12.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we consider examples like these,

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:14.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s power and wisdom,

00:56:14.975 --> 00:56:16.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t that make us wonder,

00:56:16.977 --> 00:56:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How could anyone deny the evidence

00:56:19.355 --> 00:56:22.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an intelligent and loving Designer?’

00:56:22.483 --> 00:56:24.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 1:18 indicates

00:56:24.735 --> 00:56:29.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that such denial
requires suppressing the truth.

00:56:29.573 --> 00:56:30.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:56:30.658 --> 00:56:34.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice what it says at Romans 1:19:

00:56:36.038 --> 00:56:40.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because what may be known about God

00:56:40.042 --> 00:56:43.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is clearly evident

00:56:43.295 --> 00:56:46.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[clearly evident] among them,

00:56:46.966 --> 00:56:49.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God made it clear to them.”

00:56:49.468 --> 00:56:53.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 20 says:
“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen

00:56:53.931 --> 00:56:56.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the world’s creation onward,

00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:59.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are perceived
by the things made,

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even his eternal power and Godship,

00:57:02.022 --> 00:57:06.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they
[namely those who suppress the truth]

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:08.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are inexcusable.”

00:57:08.946 --> 00:57:11.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s existence and his qualities

00:57:11.991 --> 00:57:16.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were apparent the moment
mankind first appeared on earth.

00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the evidence has only become clearer

00:57:18.914 --> 00:57:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the passage of time
and the advancement of technology

00:57:21.959 --> 00:57:25.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enables us to discover
what God has done.

00:57:25.963 --> 00:57:29.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first way that we strengthen
our faith in God’s existence

00:57:29.925 --> 00:57:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—through study and meditation—

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditating on the evidence.

00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to help us with this,

00:57:37.766 --> 00:57:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find an abundance of published material
about creation on jw.org,

00:57:42.771 --> 00:57:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we find brochures,
articles in the series “Was It Designed?”

00:57:47.443 --> 00:57:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and interviews with scientists.

00:57:50.362 --> 00:57:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second way that we strengthen our faith

00:57:53.073 --> 00:57:56.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by earnestly praying for more faith.

00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said, as recorded at Luke 11:13,

00:57:59.288 --> 00:58:03.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘God will give his holy spirit
to those asking him for it,’

00:58:03.167 --> 00:58:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and part of that spirit’s fruitage is faith.

00:58:07.296 --> 00:58:11.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, we strengthen our faith
by building the faith of others.

00:58:11.925 --> 00:58:12.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:58:12.968 --> 00:58:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By drawing attention to the evidence
that supports the truth.

00:58:17.139 --> 00:58:20.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, patiently build
the faith of your children.

00:58:20.642 --> 00:58:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they have doubts,
address them promptly, kindly, calmly.

00:58:24.229 --> 00:58:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t dismiss their questions,
and don’t get upset.

00:58:27.566 --> 00:58:29.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be glad they asked.

00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows they care,
and they want to understand.

00:58:31.487 --> 00:58:34.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept the challenge; present the evidence.

00:58:34.239 --> 00:58:37.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for it together
“when you sit in your house . . .

00:58:37.201 --> 00:58:41.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you walk on the road . . .
when you lie down and when you get up.”

00:58:41.538 --> 00:58:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note what strengthens the faith

00:58:45.042 --> 00:58:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one of our brothers who is a scientist.

00:58:50.297 --> 00:58:52.049 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As a mechanical design educator,

00:58:52.049 --> 00:58:53.675 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I view even natural things

00:58:53.675 --> 00:58:55.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from a design perspective.

00:58:55.677 --> 00:59:00.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mechanical design considers not only
the individual components of a machine

00:59:00.682 --> 00:59:03.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how they interact.

00:59:03.394 --> 00:59:06.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From this viewpoint, human vision

00:59:06.063 --> 00:59:09.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a magnificent example of design.

00:59:11.068 --> 00:59:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a single eye,
the cornea, the iris, and the lens

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:59:17.449 --> 00:59:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The light-sensitive cells of the retina,
called photoreceptors,

00:59:20.619 --> 00:59:22.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produce nerve signals.

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors

00:59:25.749 --> 00:59:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are transmitted by the optic nerve
to the brain,

00:59:29.086 --> 00:59:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they are processed
to produce a perceived image.

00:59:32.214 --> 00:59:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now just imagine

00:59:34.216 --> 00:59:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the multiplied complexity

00:59:36.593 --> 00:59:38.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when two eyes interact.

00:59:39.888 --> 00:59:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly mind-boggling is

00:59:42.391 --> 00:59:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the amount of information
being constantly processed

00:59:46.979 --> 00:59:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more than 130 million retinal receptors

00:59:50.399 --> 00:59:54.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then transmitted
through the 1.2 million nerve fibers

00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the optic nerve to the brain.

00:59:57.698 --> 01:00:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, the sheer complexity

01:00:00.075 --> 01:00:03.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how all these components
flawlessly interact

01:00:03.662 --> 01:00:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is evidence of a superior Designer.

01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some disagree.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They propose that the eye evolved

01:00:11.962 --> 01:00:14.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a light-sensitive patch
in some ancestral creature

01:00:14.798 --> 01:00:17.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through small random changes.

01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:21.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the proposed process unrealistic.

01:00:21.555 --> 01:00:23.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike design,

01:00:23.557 --> 01:00:27.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is unplanned and without a goal.

01:00:27.019 --> 01:00:29.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are asked to imagine that a complex system

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can develop without direction,

01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while in the natural world
things tend to become disorganized.

01:00:36.987 --> 01:00:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But consider something
even more mind-boggling:

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design of the eye,
the optic nerve, and the brain

01:00:43.785 --> 01:00:46.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they function and interact

01:00:46.413 --> 01:00:49.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are completely documented in our DNA.

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, our DNA
contains all the instructions

01:00:53.378 --> 01:00:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for building an entire human body.

01:00:56.423 --> 01:00:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While science relies

01:00:57.966 --> 01:01:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only on physical explanations,

01:01:00.969 --> 01:01:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many individual scientists reason

01:01:03.847 --> 01:01:06.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highly ordered natural systems

01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:08.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are evidence of a Designer.

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My personal conclusion is

01:01:11.104 --> 01:01:13.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is a God who is revealed

01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the magnificent designs of nature.

01:01:19.321 --> 01:01:23.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does faith in God’s existence benefit us?

01:01:23.242 --> 01:01:28.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having genuine faith in the loving,
intelligent Designer of this universe

01:01:28.205 --> 01:01:31.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives our lives meaning and purpose.

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:36.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That faith is the basis for obedience
to Jehovah’s righteous standards

01:01:36.129 --> 01:01:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—standards that benefit us.

01:01:38.507 --> 01:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we don’t fear the future,
because faith gives us hope.

01:01:42.886 --> 01:01:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t fear death,
because our hope is in the Source of life.

01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy we are that Jehovah has provided

01:01:50.727 --> 01:01:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
abundant evidence that he exists!

01:01:53.605 --> 01:01:58.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, are there facets
of Jehovah’s personality

01:01:58.610 --> 01:02:01.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we couldn’t fully comprehend
from a study of creation alone?

01:02:01.989 --> 01:02:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:07.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for this we need to study
his inspired Word.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen
our faith in God’s Word?

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:14.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay careful attention
to Brother Mark Noumair,

01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:02:16.503 --> 01:02:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he now presents
the next talk of this symposium,

01:02:19.756 --> 01:02:23.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Word.”

01:02:30.392 --> 01:02:34.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you experienced
an unexpected financial setback?

01:02:34.438 --> 01:02:37.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your child struggling
to resist peer pressure

01:02:37.149 --> 01:02:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unwholesome influences from the Internet?

01:02:40.402 --> 01:02:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been diagnosed
with a life-threatening disease?

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in this wicked system
can seem like a dark wilderness.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may feel alone, discouraged,

01:02:50.996 --> 01:02:53.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like we just don’t know where to turn.

01:02:53.582 --> 01:02:55.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is why more than ever,

01:02:55.584 --> 01:02:59.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to strengthen
our faith in God’s Word.

01:02:59.046 --> 01:03:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we study the Bible and take it to heart,

01:03:01.632 --> 01:03:05.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith in God grows
and something amazing happens.

01:03:05.886 --> 01:03:09.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out what that is
at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:12.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 13

01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Thessalonians 2:13:

01:03:16.104 --> 01:03:18.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, that is why

01:03:18.357 --> 01:03:21.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we also thank God unceasingly,

01:03:21.234 --> 01:03:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because when you received God’s word,

01:03:24.112 --> 01:03:26.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which you heard from us,

01:03:26.114 --> 01:03:29.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you accepted it not as the word of men

01:03:29.451 --> 01:03:32.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but, just as it truthfully is,

01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as the word of God,

01:03:34.623 --> 01:03:38.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is also at work in you believers.”

01:03:39.294 --> 01:03:42.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does God’s Word work in us?

01:03:42.547 --> 01:03:47.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has already transformed us
into faithful servants of Jehovah God,

01:03:47.552 --> 01:03:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also gives us
the power to remain strong

01:03:51.473 --> 01:03:53.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under difficult circumstances.

01:03:53.975 --> 01:03:56.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This subject is timely

01:03:56.186 --> 01:03:58.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we live in a world where so many

01:03:58.855 --> 01:04:01.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plant seeds of doubt about the Bible.

01:04:01.066 --> 01:04:04.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say it is something outdated
or inaccurate.

01:04:04.903 --> 01:04:09.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is our determination not to allow
the world’s mistaken views

01:04:09.825 --> 01:04:13.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to erode our faith in the Bible.

01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:16.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we’re going to look
at three proofs

01:04:16.248 --> 01:04:19.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us maintain our love and confidence

01:04:19.668 --> 01:04:21.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s inspired Word:

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
its prophecies,
what it says about the earth,

01:04:25.465 --> 01:04:28.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its survival against all odds.

01:04:28.301 --> 01:04:32.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take the first point
—Bible prophecies.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beyond man’s reach

01:04:34.182 --> 01:04:38.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the ability
to foresee the future in detail.

01:04:38.395 --> 01:04:40.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Almighty God can do this.

01:04:40.731 --> 01:04:43.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, secular history tells us

01:04:43.942 --> 01:04:47.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the year 539 B.C.E.,

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:50.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man named Cyrus
conquered the land of Babylon

01:04:50.407 --> 01:04:53.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowed thousands of Jewish captives
to return home

01:04:53.952 --> 01:04:56.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

01:04:56.913 --> 01:04:59.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also tells us about these events,

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:02.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one notable exception.

01:05:02.544 --> 01:05:07.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While secular history recounts these events
after they happened,

01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:11.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible foretold these events
before they took place

01:05:11.136 --> 01:05:14.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in fact, some 200 years before.

01:05:14.306 --> 01:05:17.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a closer look
and see for ourselves.

01:05:17.476 --> 01:05:21.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Isaiah chapter 44

01:05:21.271 --> 01:05:23.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 44—

01:05:23.273 --> 01:05:27.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 27 and 28.

01:05:27.986 --> 01:05:31.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read these verses,
please take special notice

01:05:31.782 --> 01:05:36.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how many times the word “will” appears.

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:40.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One saying to the deep waters,

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:45.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be evaporated,
and I will dry up all your rivers’;

01:05:45.337 --> 01:05:48.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,

01:05:48.423 --> 01:05:53.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will completely carry out
all my will’;

01:05:53.094 --> 01:05:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying of Jerusalem,
‘She will be rebuilt,’

01:05:57.265 --> 01:06:01.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the temple,
‘Your foundation will be laid.’”

01:06:01.895 --> 01:06:04.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t Jehovah God just guessing

01:06:04.439 --> 01:06:07.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or trying to figure out the future.

01:06:07.025 --> 01:06:09.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s decided what will happen,

01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:12.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will make it happen.

01:06:12.197 --> 01:06:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could the Bible predict
this kind of detail

01:06:15.158 --> 01:06:18.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 200 years in advance?

01:06:18.245 --> 01:06:20.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is only one explanation.

01:06:20.747 --> 01:06:24.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn a couple of chapters over
to Isaiah chapter 46,

01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:27.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 10.

01:06:28.922 --> 01:06:32.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From the beginning I foretell the outcome,

01:06:32.342 --> 01:06:36.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and from long ago
the things that have not yet been done.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I say, ‘My decision will stand,

01:06:40.475 --> 01:06:44.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will do whatever I please.’”

01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:47.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s fulfilled prophecies like these

01:06:47.566 --> 01:06:51.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that build trust and confidence
in God’s Word.

01:06:52.863 --> 01:06:55.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another reason
we have faith in the Bible

01:06:55.824 --> 01:06:58.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of what it says about the earth.

01:06:58.827 --> 01:07:02.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider an example at Job chapter 26,

01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:05.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 7.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 26:7:

01:07:11.423 --> 01:07:15.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He stretches out the northern sky
over empty space,

01:07:15.802 --> 01:07:20.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suspending the earth upon nothing.”

01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:25.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was stated some 3,500 years ago.

01:07:25.729 --> 01:07:28.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job’s statement
would have appeared ridiculous

01:07:28.607 --> 01:07:30.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Greek philosopher Aristotle,

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:33.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who taught that an object must rest upon

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be attached to something
or else it will fall.

01:07:36.865 --> 01:07:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not until 1687

01:07:39.367 --> 01:07:42.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the scientist Isaac Newton explained

01:07:42.329 --> 01:07:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the earth is held in orbit
by an invisible force

01:07:46.082 --> 01:07:50.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appearing as if it were suspended on nothing.

01:07:50.629 --> 01:07:54.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did the Bible know the truth
more than 3,000 years ago?

01:07:54.633 --> 01:07:56.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer:

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:01.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the Word of God,
and “God . . . cannot lie.”

01:08:02.182 --> 01:08:04.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take our third line of evidence,

01:08:04.351 --> 01:08:07.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is the Bible’s survival.

01:08:08.772 --> 01:08:12.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the original books of the Bible
have disappeared,

01:08:12.233 --> 01:08:16.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accurate copies of the Bible manuscripts
have survived to our day

01:08:16.821 --> 01:08:20.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite natural decay, fierce opposition,

01:08:20.075 --> 01:08:23.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deliberate tampering with its message.

01:08:23.244 --> 01:08:26.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:8 tells us:

01:08:26.206 --> 01:08:30.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of our God endures forever.”

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:34.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible has not endured
as a mere museum display;

01:08:34.714 --> 01:08:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
its message has endured.

01:08:37.133 --> 01:08:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That inspired message

01:08:39.135 --> 01:08:42.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been conveyed in over 3,000 languages.

01:08:42.305 --> 01:08:47.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is irrefutable proof
of its divine origin.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:50.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following video
presents additional evidence

01:08:50.855 --> 01:08:53.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible is God’s Word.

01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:55.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay attention to this.

01:08:58.822 --> 01:09:01.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is a book of facts.

01:09:01.449 --> 01:09:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about real people, real events,

01:09:04.327 --> 01:09:06.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real history in real places.

01:09:06.788 --> 01:09:08.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hebrew Scriptures,

01:09:08.873 --> 01:09:11.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are at least 53 people

01:09:11.543 --> 01:09:14.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confirmed archaeologically.

01:09:14.212 --> 01:09:17.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example is Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt.

01:09:17.882 --> 01:09:20.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible mentions his invasion of Judah,

01:09:20.552 --> 01:09:22.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
specifically dating it

01:09:22.721 --> 01:09:26.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the fifth year
of [Judean] King Rehoboam.”

01:09:26.766 --> 01:09:28.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a long time,

01:09:28.768 --> 01:09:31.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only record of that invasion

01:09:31.354 --> 01:09:33.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the one found in the Bible.

01:09:33.857 --> 01:09:37.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then a relief on the wall of a temple
at Karnak, Egypt,

01:09:37.902 --> 01:09:39.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was discovered, depicting

01:09:39.904 --> 01:09:42.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shishak with captives.

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:46.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also records names
of conquered Israelite towns,

01:09:46.536 --> 01:09:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of which have been identified
with Biblical sites.

01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:54.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also mentions the “Field of Abram,”

01:09:54.627 --> 01:09:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the earliest reference in Egyptian records

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Biblical patriarch Abraham.

01:10:01.885 --> 01:10:05.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strengthens our confidence and faith

01:10:05.013 --> 01:10:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible as God’s Word.

01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:10.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible was written
on perishable materials,

01:10:10.894 --> 01:10:14.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as papyrus and parchment.

01:10:14.314 --> 01:10:16.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While no originals are known to exist today,

01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:20.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of ancient copies available now

01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:25.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is staggering:
some 11,000 Hebrew and Greek manuscripts,

01:10:25.116 --> 01:10:29.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than for any other
ancient piece of literature.

01:10:29.537 --> 01:10:34.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By comparing the earliest,
most authoritative manuscripts,

01:10:34.209 --> 01:10:37.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scholars can identify inaccuracies

01:10:37.378 --> 01:10:40.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mistakes that have crept in.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the vast majority of differences

01:10:43.009 --> 01:10:45.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not change the meaning at all.

01:10:45.512 --> 01:10:48.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example is found at Luke 4:17,

01:10:48.306 --> 01:10:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jesus
“opened the scroll” of Isaiah.

01:10:52.727 --> 01:10:54.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some manuscripts say

01:10:54.729 --> 01:10:57.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he “unrolled the scroll.”

01:10:57.941 --> 01:11:00.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t the meaning the same?

01:11:01.569 --> 01:11:05.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s message has even survived
changes in language.

01:11:05.824 --> 01:11:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures
quoted the Hebrew Scriptures,

01:11:10.453 --> 01:11:13.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but often
from the <i>Greek Septuagint</i>  translation.

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:16.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, they paraphrased such quotations,

01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:18.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using slightly different wording.

01:11:18.753 --> 01:11:21.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the message remained the same.

01:11:21.673 --> 01:11:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of Jesus’ words,

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely spoken in first-century Hebrew,

01:11:26.052 --> 01:11:28.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were recorded in Greek.

01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, his message is clear.

01:11:31.641 --> 01:11:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, at least parts of God’s Word

01:11:34.644 --> 01:11:38.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be read in more than 3,000 languages.

01:11:39.065 --> 01:11:40.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible’s survival reveals

01:11:40.775 --> 01:11:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a puzzling paradox:

01:11:42.443 --> 01:11:44.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout history,

01:11:44.112 --> 01:11:46.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people were willing to die
to preserve the Bible

01:11:46.823 --> 01:11:49.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it available to everyone.

01:11:49.534 --> 01:11:51.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others were willing to kill

01:11:51.911 --> 01:11:55.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent access to it
and wipe it out of existence.

01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:56.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:11:56.958 --> 01:11:59.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the book’s content.

01:11:59.002 --> 01:12:02.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word “is alive and exerts power.”

01:12:02.297 --> 01:12:04.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It changes people’s lives

01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:06.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways that some welcome

01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:11.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but others resist—violently at times.

01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:15.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, responding
to Roman Emperor Diocletian’s edict

01:12:15.727 --> 01:12:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 303 C.E.

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:20.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to destroy the sacred Scriptures by fire,”

01:12:20.773 --> 01:12:25.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Felix, a bishop of Thibiuca, reportedly said,

01:12:25.028 --> 01:12:28.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is better for me to be burned
than the sacred Scriptures.”

01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:32.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He paid with his life.

01:12:32.076 --> 01:12:36.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Efforts to destroy God’s message for mankind
continue today,

01:12:36.831 --> 01:12:41.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the word of our God endures forever.”

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:44.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t that faith-strengthening

01:12:44.964 --> 01:12:48.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see more evidence
that the Bible is God’s Word?

01:12:48.635 --> 01:12:51.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen
our conviction in God’s Word?

01:12:51.846 --> 01:12:56.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do so by creating
study projects to build our faith.

01:12:56.142 --> 01:12:58.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One fascinating project involves

01:12:58.353 --> 01:13:01.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophecy at Genesis 3:15.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you can quote it by heart,

01:13:04.359 --> 01:13:08.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but have you ever sat down
and taken the time to make a timeline,

01:13:08.029 --> 01:13:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listing key scriptures that show
how God bit by bit shed light

01:13:12.408 --> 01:13:16.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the individuals and the arrangement
referred to in this verse?

01:13:16.329 --> 01:13:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we take time to really study the Bible

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:23.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on these golden threads
running through the Bible,

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith in God’s Word will be strengthened.

01:13:26.923 --> 01:13:29.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you had doubts about something?

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:30.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then write it down.

01:13:30.843 --> 01:13:34.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then use our research tools
such as the <i>Study Bible</i>,

01:13:34.055 --> 01:13:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>JW Library®</i>, <i>Watchtower ONLINE Library</i>®
to dig deeper.

01:13:38.726 --> 01:13:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s worth the effort.

01:13:40.728 --> 01:13:44.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’re a parent,
help your children come to know

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:48.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fall in love
with the Author of the Bible.

01:13:50.238 --> 01:13:53.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so close to begin
the real life in the new world.

01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:58.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is the time to strengthen
our trust and confidence in the Bible.

01:13:58.204 --> 01:14:00.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we have strong faith in God’s Word,

01:14:00.999 --> 01:14:05.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can feel as did our young brother Ruslan
from Turkmenistan

01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who faces his second prison term
because of his faith.

01:14:10.049 --> 01:14:12.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He declared:

01:14:12.093 --> 01:14:16.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have strong faith
that Jehovah will reward me. . . .

01:14:16.389 --> 01:14:20.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where there is a strong hope,
there is endless joy;

01:14:20.018 --> 01:14:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where there is joy,
there is strength and endurance.

01:14:23.479 --> 01:14:28.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a strong person can never be broken.”

01:14:28.276 --> 01:14:31.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too will never be broken

01:14:31.321 --> 01:14:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you maintain your faith in God’s Word.

01:14:35.783 --> 01:14:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Samuel Herd of the Governing Body

01:14:38.161 --> 01:14:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk in this symposium,

01:14:41.664 --> 01:14:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why We Have Faith
in . . . God’s Moral Standards.”

01:14:52.675 --> 01:14:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pressure from the world can erode
our determination to do what is right.

01:14:56.971 --> 01:14:59.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, even a mature Christian

01:14:59.307 --> 01:15:02.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be inclined to do what is bad.

01:15:02.101 --> 01:15:06.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Romans 7:21-23.

01:15:06.147 --> 01:15:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul was certainly mature,

01:15:09.233 --> 01:15:12.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice what he said of himself

01:15:12.153 --> 01:15:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read Romans 7:21-23:

01:15:18.242 --> 01:15:21.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I find, then, this law in my case:

01:15:21.454 --> 01:15:23.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I wish to do what is right,

01:15:23.748 --> 01:15:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what is bad is present in me.

01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:29.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I really delight in the law of God

01:15:29.003 --> 01:15:31.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the man I am within,

01:15:31.047 --> 01:15:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I see in my body another law

01:15:34.175 --> 01:15:36.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“warring against the law of my mind

01:15:36.928 --> 01:15:40.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and leading me captive to sin’s law

01:15:40.098 --> 01:15:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in my body.”

01:15:43.559 --> 01:15:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul, we might find that we have a war, 

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a struggle, inside us

01:15:49.816 --> 01:15:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we fight against the law of sin.

01:15:53.152 --> 01:15:55.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, like Paul,

01:15:55.196 --> 01:15:58.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that for us to please Jehovah,

01:15:58.366 --> 01:16:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must live in harmony with His standards.

01:16:03.329 --> 01:16:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10.

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of Jehovah’s moral standards?

01:16:12.296 --> 01:16:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the list of moral issues

01:16:14.424 --> 01:16:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we choose not to succumb to.

01:16:18.261 --> 01:16:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, it says:

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or do you not know that unrighteous people

01:16:27.645 --> 01:16:30.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will not inherit God’s Kingdom?

01:16:30.022 --> 01:16:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

01:16:32.024 --> 01:16:34.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who are sexually immoral,

01:16:34.318 --> 01:16:36.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“idolaters, adulterers,

01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:39.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men who submit to homosexual acts,

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men who practice homosexuality,

01:16:42.535 --> 01:16:45.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thieves, greedy people,

01:16:45.163 --> 01:16:48.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“drunkards, revilers, and extortioners

01:16:48.624 --> 01:16:51.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must be firmly convinced
that these moral standards

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah are right and beneficial.

01:17:01.053 --> 01:17:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we have faith in these standards?

01:17:04.056 --> 01:17:08.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find out, find Isaiah 48:17.

01:17:08.144 --> 01:17:12.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you will see
that we can have faith in God’s standards

01:17:12.732 --> 01:17:16.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they always benefit us.

01:17:18.029 --> 01:17:20.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17 says:

01:17:20.865 --> 01:17:23.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,

01:17:23.201 --> 01:17:25.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:29.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

01:17:29.165 --> 01:17:31.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:35.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.’”

01:17:36.589 --> 01:17:38.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the point?

01:17:38.633 --> 01:17:41.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is teaching us

01:17:41.302 --> 01:17:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to benefit ourselves.

01:17:44.013 --> 01:17:47.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can have faith
in his standards of right and wrong.

01:17:49.227 --> 01:17:52.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re unchanging,
and they produce good results

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under all circumstances and in all cultures.

01:17:57.193 --> 01:18:00.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider God’s standard for marriage.

01:18:00.738 --> 01:18:04.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created marriage as a permanent,

01:18:04.116 --> 01:18:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving union between a man and a woman.

01:18:08.371 --> 01:18:11.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave Adam a wife, Eve

01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:16.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not Eve and B and D—
just Eve.

01:18:16.003 --> 01:18:19.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told them:
“Be fruitful and become many . . .

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fill the . . . earth.”

01:18:21.717 --> 01:18:24.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at 1 Corinthians 6:18.

01:18:24.971 --> 01:18:27.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is making the point that sex

01:18:27.807 --> 01:18:32.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside of marriage
is prohibited by Jehovah.

01:18:32.562 --> 01:18:35.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 6:18 says:

01:18:35.856 --> 01:18:38.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Flee from sexual immorality!

01:18:38.442 --> 01:18:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every other sin that a man may commit

01:18:41.237 --> 01:18:43.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is outside his body,

01:18:43.364 --> 01:18:46.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whoever practices sexual immorality

01:18:46.534 --> 01:18:50.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

01:18:52.915 --> 01:18:55.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When family members
follow Jehovah’s standards,

01:18:55.418 --> 01:18:58.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the family is secure, stable, and happy.

01:18:58.838 --> 01:19:02.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how a couple

01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefited from applying
God’s moral standards.

01:19:07.513 --> 01:19:09.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met at a party when I was in the military.

01:19:12.435 --> 01:19:16.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was on the dance floor, and I saw Frenchie.

01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:17.898 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I was like, ‘Oh!

01:19:17.898 --> 01:19:19.900 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to talk to this girl right here.’

01:19:21.861 --> 01:19:24.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole time we were just smiling
at each other

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:26.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this instant attraction.

01:19:26.365 --> 01:19:28.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was mutual.

01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:31.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, we were living together.

01:19:31.829 --> 01:19:35.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a few months go by,

01:19:35.207 --> 01:19:37.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things are going well,

01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:39.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I find out I’m pregnant.

01:19:41.714 --> 01:19:43.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he left.

01:19:44.675 --> 01:19:46.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked

01:19:47.303 --> 01:19:50.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(though I shouldn’t have been),
but I was shocked.

01:19:50.806 --> 01:19:54.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And truthfully, I was scared,

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:56.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, ‘What am I going to do now?’

01:19:56.896 --> 01:19:59.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like a failure,

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:02.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I kept asking myself,
‘How did I let this happen?’

01:20:06.739 --> 01:20:10.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I had to be there,
and I wanted to be there.

01:20:10.576 --> 01:20:12.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t know how.

01:20:13.954 --> 01:20:17.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prayed together for the first time
as a couple.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:21.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a Friday night.

01:20:21.087 --> 01:20:24.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saturday morning, we had a knock on the door.

01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:27.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to have a Bible study.

01:20:27.259 --> 01:20:29.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had us study the chapter

01:20:29.261 --> 01:20:32.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on family life and marriage.

01:20:32.306 --> 01:20:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment,

01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I wanted to have our relationship

01:20:37.353 --> 01:20:40.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be honorable before Jehovah.

01:20:41.357 --> 01:20:43.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You learn that Jehovah

01:20:43.109 --> 01:20:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant for marriages to be a permanent bond.

01:20:46.195 --> 01:20:51.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The insecurities of every disagreement

01:20:51.033 --> 01:20:53.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ending in a breakup or a divorce

01:20:53.869 --> 01:20:55.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of that went away.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to see Jehovah’s training

01:21:00.334 --> 01:21:02.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in practical ways,

01:21:02.378 --> 01:21:04.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just learning

01:21:04.672 --> 01:21:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to be a husband

01:21:07.299 --> 01:21:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who respected and cared for his wife.

01:21:12.179 --> 01:21:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We became partners
—a team, a complement—

01:21:16.392 --> 01:21:18.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was only because Jehovah

01:21:18.894 --> 01:21:21.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught us how to do it.

01:21:21.939 --> 01:21:24.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though it was difficult at the outset,

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we made that decision
to dedicate our life to do Jehovah’s will,

01:21:30.197 --> 01:21:32.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we got baptized together.

01:21:35.411 --> 01:21:37.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been married 25 years,

01:21:37.204 --> 01:21:41.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the insecurities are gone.

01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:44.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I focus on all the blessings that have come

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just from keeping Jehovah in our life,

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:50.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the best feeling in the world.

01:21:57.016 --> 01:21:59.602 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You can go at it on your own,

01:22:00.394 --> 01:22:02.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll never find the joy,

01:22:02.396 --> 01:22:05.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll never find the peace,
you’ll never find the security

01:22:05.357 --> 01:22:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from doing it Jehovah’s way.

01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:15.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was only after coming to know Jehovah

01:22:15.576 --> 01:22:17.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having faith in his standards 

01:22:17.828 --> 01:22:20.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the couple came to have a stable

01:22:20.748 --> 01:22:25.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enduring marriage of 25 years.

01:22:25.461 --> 01:22:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about us?

01:22:27.463 --> 01:22:32.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen our faith
in God’s moral standards?

01:22:32.092 --> 01:22:34.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contemplate the benefits

01:22:34.428 --> 01:22:37.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of obeying God’s moral standards

01:22:37.473 --> 01:22:41.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the consequences of disobeying them.

01:22:42.561 --> 01:22:44.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note two Bible principles.

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:47.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:29 says:

01:22:47.733 --> 01:22:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Be] wise! . . .
Ponder over this . . .

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about [the] outcome.”

01:22:53.489 --> 01:22:56.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, contemplate the benefits

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of obeying God’s moral standards.

01:23:00.454 --> 01:23:03.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, the consequences of disobeying

01:23:03.707 --> 01:23:07.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s moral standards can be severe.

01:23:08.671 --> 01:23:11.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:8 says:

01:23:11.632 --> 01:23:14.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Sow] with a view to his flesh

01:23:14.885 --> 01:23:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and] reap corruption from [the] flesh.”

01:23:21.267 --> 01:23:25.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s entertainment industry
often ignores this fact.

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:28.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith in God’s standards will grow

01:23:28.649 --> 01:23:32.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you experience
the benefits of living by them.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obeying God’s moral standards
protects us physically,

01:23:36.657 --> 01:23:39.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

01:23:40.953 --> 01:23:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s standards make us wise

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:47.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we do not have to learn

01:23:47.751 --> 01:23:50.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from painful experiences.

01:23:50.671 --> 01:23:52.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate:

01:23:52.756 --> 01:23:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re driving, and you see a sign.

01:23:55.676 --> 01:23:59.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “School speed limit:

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:02.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
15 miles an hour.”

01:24:02.266 --> 01:24:05.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you do not adhere
to that standard of law?

01:24:07.021 --> 01:24:10.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose you are driving at 50 miles an hour.

01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:13.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You hit a child crossing the road.

01:24:13.193 --> 01:24:16.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The consequence for not obeying the standard—

01:24:16.864 --> 01:24:21.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be
an extremely painful experience.

01:24:21.827 --> 01:24:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s standards protect us from the pain.

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:32.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s conclude by sharing
some verses from Psalm 19.

01:24:32.421 --> 01:24:34.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there.

01:24:35.674 --> 01:24:38.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This psalm is speaking
about Jehovah’s standards,

01:24:38.761 --> 01:24:41.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his laws, and reminders.

01:24:41.847 --> 01:24:46.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will first read Psalm 19:7:

01:24:46.644 --> 01:24:50.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The law of Jehovah is perfect,

01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:52.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“restoring strength.

01:24:52.483 --> 01:24:55.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

01:24:55.527 --> 01:24:59.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the inexperienced one wise.”

01:25:01.492 --> 01:25:05.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not need
to remain naive and inexperienced.

01:25:05.996 --> 01:25:08.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We become wise.

01:25:08.082 --> 01:25:12.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now read with me verses 8 and 9:

01:25:12.211 --> 01:25:15.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The orders from Jehovah are righteous,

01:25:15.339 --> 01:25:18.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“causing the heart to rejoice;

01:25:18.133 --> 01:25:21.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the commandment of Jehovah is clean,

01:25:21.095 --> 01:25:23.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“making the eyes shine.

01:25:23.889 --> 01:25:26.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah is pure,

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“lasting forever.

01:25:28.978 --> 01:25:31.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The judgments of Jehovah are true,

01:25:31.438 --> 01:25:34.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
altogether righteous.”

01:25:35.567 --> 01:25:39.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living by God’s standards
brings approval from Jehovah.

01:25:39.822 --> 01:25:42.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy a clean conscience

01:25:42.157 --> 01:25:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a good relationship with him.

01:25:45.911 --> 01:25:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, verse 11 says:

01:25:48.664 --> 01:25:52.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By them your servant has been warned;

01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:57.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping them, there is a large reward.”

01:25:58.465 --> 01:26:02.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Have faith in God’s moral standards.

01:26:06.974 --> 01:26:10.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obey them and become wise.

01:26:10.728 --> 01:26:13.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will protect you physically, 

01:26:13.063 --> 01:26:16.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

01:26:16.442 --> 01:26:21.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will have a clean conscience
and Jehovah’s approval

01:26:21.447 --> 01:26:25.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and in the end, everlasting life.

01:26:27.953 --> 01:26:31.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body
will now present 

01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:34.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final talk of this symposium,

01:26:34.293 --> 01:26:38.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Love.”

01:26:45.846 --> 01:26:48.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people believe in God.

01:26:48.766 --> 01:26:50.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what sense?

01:26:50.768 --> 01:26:55.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They believe that there must exist
a God, a Creator.

01:26:55.314 --> 01:26:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sheer logic causes them to believe this.

01:26:58.734 --> 01:27:00.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:27:00.444 --> 01:27:04.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of being aware
that there is creation.

01:27:04.406 --> 01:27:07.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Creator would not exist,

01:27:07.242 --> 01:27:09.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no creation would exist.

01:27:09.661 --> 01:27:10.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:27:10.662 --> 01:27:13.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because nothing comes from nothing.

01:27:15.292 --> 01:27:20.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is also why we know
that God has always existed.

01:27:20.297 --> 01:27:24.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If there would have been a time
when he did not exist,

01:27:24.176 --> 01:27:26.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then nothing would exist today.

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:30.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that creation exists

01:27:30.808 --> 01:27:34.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves there must be a Creator.

01:27:34.853 --> 01:27:38.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also shows
that God exists from all eternity,

01:27:38.899 --> 01:27:41.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although with our imperfect human mind

01:27:41.735 --> 01:27:44.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have a hard time grasping this.

01:27:46.115 --> 01:27:49.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are the product of his creation.

01:27:49.618 --> 01:27:54.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it enough
to believe in him as the Creator

01:27:54.373 --> 01:27:58.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because without a Creator
there could be no creation?

01:27:58.544 --> 01:27:59.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:04.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it enough for a child to believe
he has a father

01:28:04.466 --> 01:28:07.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because without a father he would not exist?

01:28:07.511 --> 01:28:08.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:28:08.929 --> 01:28:12.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A child should love his father;

01:28:12.057 --> 01:28:16.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a father normally loves
and cares for his children.

01:28:16.979 --> 01:28:19.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Creator, our Father,

01:28:19.356 --> 01:28:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only cares about his creation,

01:28:22.151 --> 01:28:24.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also loves us

01:28:24.236 --> 01:28:27.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cares for us as individuals.

01:28:29.032 --> 01:28:31.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cares about you.

01:28:32.119 --> 01:28:34.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God loves you.

01:28:35.789 --> 01:28:38.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you love him?

01:28:38.167 --> 01:28:41.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a lover of God?

01:28:41.879 --> 01:28:44.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not automatic.

01:28:44.339 --> 01:28:48.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul says at 2 Timothy 3:4

01:28:48.969 --> 01:28:53.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that most people
in this time of the end would be

01:28:53.056 --> 01:28:57.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“lovers of pleasures
rather than lovers of God.”

01:28:59.354 --> 01:29:02.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we may have
feelings of worthlessness,

01:29:02.816 --> 01:29:07.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and such feelings could dampen
our zeal in serving Jehovah,

01:29:07.571 --> 01:29:10.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could dampen our love,
or even could cause us

01:29:10.282 --> 01:29:13.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stop serving him.

01:29:13.118 --> 01:29:16.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to build up and deepen

01:29:16.997 --> 01:29:20.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our love and trust in Jehovah.

01:29:22.085 --> 01:29:25.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves mankind.

01:29:25.088 --> 01:29:27.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What evidence is there for that?

01:29:27.925 --> 01:29:31.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see Jehovah’s love in nature.

01:29:31.303 --> 01:29:35.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He created numerous trees,
plants, and flowers

01:29:35.349 --> 01:29:37.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can enjoy them.

01:29:38.644 --> 01:29:43.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He created for us not only things
that we need to keep living

01:29:43.523 --> 01:29:45.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but things that impress our hearts

01:29:45.943 --> 01:29:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with awe and love for God,

01:29:49.071 --> 01:29:52.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Giver of “every good gift.”

01:29:53.909 --> 01:29:56.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man is not able to create one single animal

01:29:56.912 --> 01:29:59.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even a fruit or flower.

01:30:00.415 --> 01:30:03.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things God created help us to live

01:30:03.502 --> 01:30:07.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy living for as long as we do.

01:30:07.756 --> 01:30:11.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah loves mankind so much

01:30:11.385 --> 01:30:14.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave his firstborn spirit Son,

01:30:14.137 --> 01:30:16.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom we came to know as Jesus Christ,

01:30:16.556 --> 01:30:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a ransom for the sins
of us imperfect humans

01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:23.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(for those who love him)

01:30:23.647 --> 01:30:26.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they may live and enjoy

01:30:26.483 --> 01:30:29.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s love forever.

01:30:30.988 --> 01:30:35.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the first humans
rebelled against Jehovah God,

01:30:35.033 --> 01:30:38.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knew that there would be many others

01:30:38.662 --> 01:30:41.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would choose to serve him out of love.

01:30:42.833 --> 01:30:47.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to John chapter 6.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:52.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your listening in to this program is proof

01:30:52.175 --> 01:30:56.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only of your love
for Jehovah God and Jesus

01:30:56.138 --> 01:31:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also of their love

01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:03.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you as an individual.

01:31:03.437 --> 01:31:08.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 6:44, Jesus said:

01:31:10.235 --> 01:31:12.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No man can come to me

01:31:12.612 --> 01:31:16.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless the Father, who sent me, draws him.”

01:31:20.037 --> 01:31:24.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures show
that Jehovah has given humans free will.

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:27.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone has a choice

01:31:27.294 --> 01:31:29.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to serving him.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God gently draws to himself

01:31:32.924 --> 01:31:36.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who have a heart
that is “rightly disposed.”

01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:41.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does so through the Bible’s message

01:31:41.099 --> 01:31:43.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through his holy spirit.

01:31:43.977 --> 01:31:47.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah draw us?

01:31:47.356 --> 01:31:50.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Greek verb rendered “draw”

01:31:50.192 --> 01:31:55.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is used in reference
to hauling in a net of fishes.

01:31:55.197 --> 01:31:58.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah drag us against our will,

01:31:58.492 --> 01:32:00.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forcing us to serve him?

01:32:00.577 --> 01:32:01.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us free will,

01:32:04.247 --> 01:32:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he does not force our heart open.

01:32:08.585 --> 01:32:11.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scholar puts it this way:

01:32:11.505 --> 01:32:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no handle on the outside
of the door of the human heart.

01:32:16.259 --> 01:32:18.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must be opened from within.”

01:32:20.722 --> 01:32:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah searches through the billions
of hearts in this world,

01:32:25.394 --> 01:32:29.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking for individuals
who are inclined toward him.

01:32:31.566 --> 01:32:36.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he finds such a person,
he responds in a touching way.

01:32:36.321 --> 01:32:39.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you such a person?

01:32:39.574 --> 01:32:42.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We trust you are.

01:32:42.035 --> 01:32:45.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gently attracts, or tugs,

01:32:45.288 --> 01:32:50.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the hearts of ones
who are “rightly disposed.”

01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:53.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does so in two ways

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:56.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—through the Bible’s message of good news

01:32:56.758 --> 01:32:59.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through his holy spirit.

01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:04.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah sees a heart
that is responsive to Bible truth,

01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:07.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he uses his spirit to help the individual

01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:11.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grasp and apply that truth in his life.

01:33:12.691 --> 01:33:14.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without divine help,

01:33:14.693 --> 01:33:18.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could never become
genuine followers of Jesus

01:33:18.071 --> 01:33:21.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and devoted worshippers of Jehovah.

01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:25.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah draws people because he sees
something good in their heart

01:33:25.954 --> 01:33:29.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cares about them as individuals.

01:33:30.625 --> 01:33:35.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does knowing that Jehovah cares
about his worshippers as individuals

01:33:35.088 --> 01:33:39.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move you to want to open
that door of your heart

01:33:39.092 --> 01:33:41.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and open it wide?

01:33:41.970 --> 01:33:44.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

01:33:44.347 --> 01:33:47.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a brother named Carlos

01:33:47.392 --> 01:33:51.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to appreciate
that Jehovah is the loving Father

01:33:51.104 --> 01:33:53.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom he had always yearned for.

01:33:58.028 --> 01:34:01.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went through difficult times
during my childhood,

01:34:02.866 --> 01:34:04.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was like my Father.

01:34:07.746 --> 01:34:09.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was my refuge.

01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:16.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first memory I have of my dad

01:34:16.171 --> 01:34:19.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when I went to visit him

01:34:19.132 --> 01:34:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the prison where he was being held.

01:34:27.098 --> 01:34:30.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jehovah so many times
for my dad to come back home.

01:34:32.103 --> 01:34:33.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day,

01:34:33.563 --> 01:34:36.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mom said, “Dad’s coming home today.”

01:34:36.483 --> 01:34:39.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to school,
and when I came back, he was there.

01:34:40.654 --> 01:34:44.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that he was finally back for good
and that it would be forever.

01:34:50.789 --> 01:34:54.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But soon after that,
I heard my mom and my grandmother crying,

01:34:54.626 --> 01:34:58.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they started to explain
that my dad was back in prison.

01:35:01.758 --> 01:35:05.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From then on, I felt hatred,
resentment, and anger toward my dad

01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:08.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also toward Jehovah.

01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:17.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to take drugs

01:35:17.023 --> 01:35:19.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to lead an immoral and violent lifestyle.

01:35:25.865 --> 01:35:29.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a couple of sisters
gave me a magazine.

01:35:29.077 --> 01:35:31.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was looking through it,

01:35:31.037 --> 01:35:34.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the experience about Dustin.

01:35:36.668 --> 01:35:38.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to think about the times

01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:40.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during my childhood

01:35:40.213 --> 01:35:42.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I would take refuge in Jehovah

01:35:42.048 --> 01:35:43.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would feel the same way Dustin did.

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say: “Jehovah is there.

01:35:45.635 --> 01:35:47.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hasn’t abandoned me.”

01:35:48.638 --> 01:35:51.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin never doubted Jehovah’s love,

01:35:51.474 --> 01:35:53.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up until the day he died.

01:35:55.645 --> 01:35:59.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

01:35:59.566 --> 01:36:02.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him to forgive me because,

01:36:02.652 --> 01:36:04.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well,

01:36:04.821 --> 01:36:06.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wasn’t his fault.

01:36:09.409 --> 01:36:13.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night I poured out
all my feelings to Jehovah.

01:36:13.204 --> 01:36:17.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

01:36:23.757 --> 01:36:26.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt Jehovah’s love every step of the way.

01:36:26.885 --> 01:36:30.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed it through the brothers
who didn’t judge me for what I had done.

01:36:39.147 --> 01:36:41.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how many problems we have

01:36:41.483 --> 01:36:44.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how far we’ve drifted away from Jehovah.

01:36:46.613 --> 01:36:48.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never abandons us.

01:36:57.082 --> 01:37:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has lovingly helped
many brothers and sisters

01:37:01.044 --> 01:37:03.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of his love for them.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:08.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can reassure you
that Jehovah will help you as well

01:37:08.385 --> 01:37:11.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah loves you too.

01:37:12.889 --> 01:37:17.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Jehovah
demonstrated his love for Carlos?

01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:22.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through his worshippers,
Jehovah lovingly cared for this young man.

01:37:22.899 --> 01:37:27.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 119.

01:37:28.697 --> 01:37:31.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had not forgotten Carlos,

01:37:31.449 --> 01:37:34.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he had strayed for a time.

01:37:34.452 --> 01:37:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminds us of the words

01:37:36.746 --> 01:37:41.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 119:176:

01:37:42.252 --> 01:37:45.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have strayed like a lost sheep.

01:37:45.463 --> 01:37:47.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Search for your servant,

01:37:47.465 --> 01:37:50.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I have not forgotten your commandments.”

01:37:52.095 --> 01:37:56.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are indications that Psalm 119

01:37:56.099 --> 01:38:00.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have been written
by young Prince Hezekiah.

01:38:00.019 --> 01:38:03.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hezekiah poured out his heart to Jehovah,

01:38:03.148 --> 01:38:06.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah responded.

01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:10.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters, please pour out
your hearts to Jehovah,

01:38:10.822 --> 01:38:14.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note
of how he will answer your prayers.

01:38:16.536 --> 01:38:20.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3.

01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:24.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can and will

01:38:24.502 --> 01:38:28.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intervene positively in your life.

01:38:28.089 --> 01:38:32.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says at Ephesians 3:20:

01:38:33.595 --> 01:38:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now to the one who can,
according to his power

01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:38.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is operating in us,

01:38:38.892 --> 01:38:41.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do more than superabundantly

01:38:41.811 --> 01:38:45.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression
“his power that is operating in us”

01:38:52.197 --> 01:38:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—is this not something very encouraging
and faith-strengthening?

01:38:57.202 --> 01:39:00.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His power is not just “operating in us”

01:39:00.497 --> 01:39:04.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “operating in us . . . superabundantly”

01:39:04.834 --> 01:39:07.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no, but “more than superabundantly,”

01:39:07.712 --> 01:39:11.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond what we can envision or comprehend.

01:39:12.217 --> 01:39:14.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will draw close to you,”

01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:17.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says James 4:8.

01:39:17.847 --> 01:39:20.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether he wrote Psalm 119 or not,

01:39:20.725 --> 01:39:25.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hezekiah strengthened
his faith in Jehovah and trusted him.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:29.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did so even though he was surrounded
by false worshippers

01:39:29.442 --> 01:39:33.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may have been ridiculed
by members of the royal court.

01:39:35.114 --> 01:39:37.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed Hezekiah.

01:39:37.617 --> 01:39:42.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you trust Jehovah,
he will bless you as well.

01:39:42.038 --> 01:39:44.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With reliance on God,

01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:47.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you too can endure trials

01:39:47.293 --> 01:39:49.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as integrity-keepers.

01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apply Bible principles in your life,

01:39:53.049 --> 01:39:56.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how following Jehovah’s advice

01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will always work out for your good.

01:40:00.932 --> 01:40:05.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith in God’s love helps us
to see beyond our imperfections

01:40:05.645 --> 01:40:09.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the negative experiences
that we may have had in the past.

01:40:10.567 --> 01:40:13.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us

01:40:13.778 --> 01:40:17.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—as a cherished part of his household.

01:40:17.323 --> 01:40:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are a family member of Jehovah’s family.

01:40:23.121 --> 01:40:25.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the encouragement we receive

01:40:25.623 --> 01:40:27.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 119

01:40:27.625 --> 01:40:32.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 32.

01:40:33.131 --> 01:40:36.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in God’s love gives us the confidence

01:40:36.551 --> 01:40:39.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to keep going.

01:40:41.264 --> 01:40:46.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 119:32, it says:

01:40:49.606 --> 01:40:53.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will eagerly pursue
the way of your commandments

01:40:53.818 --> 01:40:57.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you make room for it in my heart.”

01:40:59.032 --> 01:41:04.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote says: “Or possibly,
‘you make my heart have the confidence.’”

01:41:04.662 --> 01:41:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be able to endure any trial.

01:41:08.625 --> 01:41:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there things that can separate us

01:41:11.127 --> 01:41:13.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah’s love toward us?

01:41:15.256 --> 01:41:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall what we are told
at Romans chapter 8?

01:41:19.969 --> 01:41:24.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing can separate us
from Jehovah’s love toward us.

01:41:25.725 --> 01:41:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this together,

01:41:28.144 --> 01:41:31.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans chapter 8

01:41:31.064 --> 01:41:35.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 35 to 39:

01:41:39.948 --> 01:41:43.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

01:41:43.534 --> 01:41:47.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will tribulation or distress or persecution

01:41:47.622 --> 01:41:50.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?

01:41:50.875 --> 01:41:52.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as it is written:

01:41:52.877 --> 01:41:56.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For your sake we are being put to death
all day long;

01:41:56.756 --> 01:42:01.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have been accounted
as sheep for slaughtering.’

01:42:01.052 --> 01:42:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary, in all these things

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are coming off completely victorious

01:42:08.059 --> 01:42:11.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the one who loved us.

01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:13.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am convinced
that neither death nor life

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor angels nor governments
nor things now here nor things to come

01:42:17.568 --> 01:42:21.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor powers nor height nor depth
nor any other creation

01:42:21.072 --> 01:42:24.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

01:42:24.951 --> 01:42:28.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

01:42:30.623 --> 01:42:35.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are things that can diminish
or kill our love for Jehovah,

01:42:35.294 --> 01:42:38.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we need to be careful.

01:42:39.799 --> 01:42:41.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium has reminded us

01:42:41.801 --> 01:42:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of why we have faith in God’s existence,

01:42:44.887 --> 01:42:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Word, his moral standards,

01:42:48.558 --> 01:42:50.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his love.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the world around us grows more hopeless,

01:42:53.896 --> 01:42:56.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are determined to become

01:42:56.524 --> 01:42:59.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more and more powerful by faith!

01:43:01.446 --> 01:43:05.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About Abraham, Romans 4:20 says:

01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:08.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

01:43:08.619 --> 01:43:11.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did not waver in a lack of faith;

01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:15.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he became powerful by his faith,
giving God glory.”

01:43:17.086 --> 01:43:21.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, Jehovah has also given
promises to us.

01:43:21.841 --> 01:43:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as he progressively fulfills them,

01:43:25.094 --> 01:43:29.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become
more and more “powerful by [our] faith”

01:43:29.974 --> 01:43:33.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give glory to Jehovah God!

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for highlighting our reasons for faith.

01:43:40.401 --> 01:43:42.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will now sing song number 37,

01:43:42.737 --> 01:43:46.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Serving Jehovah Whole-Souled.”

01:43:46.949 --> 01:43:50.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 37.
