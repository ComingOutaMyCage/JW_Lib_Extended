00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:21.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to this special edition
of JW Broadcasting®

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
originating from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:28.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our programs this month and next

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
will feature the entire
regional convention program for 2021.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body
and all the brothers and sisters working here

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
at world headquarters,

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s my pleasure
to welcome you to the convention.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s convention has the theme

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Powerful by Faith!”

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme scripture for today’s program

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Luke 17:5:

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
We begin this first session
with the music-video presentation.

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the video,
notice how Jehovah’s people show faith

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
by reaching out in his service

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how parents
can help their children to build faith.

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:17.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:26.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are delighted that you 
could join us for this opening session

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:30.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the “Powerful by Faith!”
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:33.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s sing together song number 5,

00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:36.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “God’s Wondrous Works.”

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:39.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, that’s song number 5.

00:13:09.108 --> 00:13:13.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is faith,
and why is it essential for us to have it?

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson,

00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:17.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:17.575 --> 00:13:20.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
will answer these questions in the talk

00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:22.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Powerful Is Faith?”

00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:31.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters:

00:13:31.297 --> 00:13:36.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to this 2021 “Powerful by Faith!”

00:13:36.135 --> 00:13:38.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let me begin by extending to all of you

00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:46.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
the warm Christian love and greetings
from the Governing Body

00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:49.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the United States Bethel family.

00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:54.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let me assure you
that we continue to pray on your behalf.

00:13:55.112 --> 00:13:57.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Powerful by Faith!”

00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:01.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what a motivating
and what an encouraging theme

00:14:01.327 --> 00:14:03.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this convention!

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:06.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we going to learn?

00:14:06.124 --> 00:14:08.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re going to concentrate

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:11.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
on answering three questions
at this convention.

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:15.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is, What is faith?

00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second one is, What can faith do for us?

00:14:19.262 --> 00:14:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the third is, How can we build our faith?

00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:28.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s appropriate, since this is
the introduction to the convention,

00:14:28.188 --> 00:14:30.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to spend some time

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking about each one of those questions.

00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:36.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s begin with that first question:

00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:38.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is faith?

00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:40.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, brothers and sisters, we know

00:14:40.909 --> 00:14:45.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
that faith is something that is produced
in us by God’s holy spirit.

00:14:45.497 --> 00:14:48.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Galatians chapter 5 says

00:14:48.249 --> 00:14:52.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
that faith is a part
of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.

00:14:52.545 --> 00:14:56.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we have God’s spirit,
we will have faith.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what exactly is faith?

00:15:00.262 --> 00:15:02.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go in our Bibles.

00:15:02.264 --> 00:15:04.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see the definition the Bible gives

00:15:04.683 --> 00:15:07.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 11:1.

00:15:07.394 --> 00:15:09.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you read it with me?

00:15:09.437 --> 00:15:12.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:1 says:

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:17.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:21.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the evident demonstration of realities

00:15:21.283 --> 00:15:23.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are not seen.”

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:28.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you’ll notice that the definition
of faith is given in two parts.

00:15:28.248 --> 00:15:30.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the first part?

00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first, it says:
“Faith is the assured expectation

00:15:35.464 --> 00:15:37.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what is hoped for.”

00:15:37.507 --> 00:15:39.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:42.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, faith is the conviction

00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:46.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we will have the things
that we hope for.

00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:48.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we could illustrate it this way:

00:15:48.435 --> 00:15:52.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, it’s like the conviction we have
when we go to bed at night

00:15:52.147 --> 00:15:55.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that the sun is going to rise
in the morning.

00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:58.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the conviction that the farmer has
when he sows his seed

00:15:58.987 --> 00:16:03.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that those seeds are going to sprout
and they’re going to grow.

00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:07.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith makes future things promised by God

00:16:07.663 --> 00:16:12.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
as real as if we already have them now.

00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:15.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that the person with faith

00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:20.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
firmly believes that everything
that Jehovah says is true

00:16:20.718 --> 00:16:24.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that all of the promises
that Jehovah has made

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
are going to come to reality.

00:16:28.434 --> 00:16:31.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the second part
of that definition?

00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:35.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith is “the evident demonstration

00:16:35.024 --> 00:16:37.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
of realities that are not seen.”

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:40.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:16:40.863 --> 00:16:45.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe we could illustrate it
with something simple like this cell phone.

00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:50.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you have a cell phone
and you have cell phone service,

00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:54.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
then wherever you may be on the earth,
I could call you right now.

00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:58.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, there are no wires
attached to this phone.

00:16:58.047 --> 00:17:00.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could that possibly work?

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:03.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, we know that this technology

00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:05.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
relies on radio waves.

00:17:05.763 --> 00:17:09.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you and I can’t see radio waves,

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
but every time we make a call
on our cell phones,

00:17:12.854 --> 00:17:17.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see the evidence,
or the “evident demonstration,”

00:17:17.733 --> 00:17:19.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
that radio waves are real,

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we cannot see them.

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:24.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:26.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we really have faith,

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:29.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means that we can believe in something

00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:33.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is verified by strong evidence,

00:17:33.082 --> 00:17:36.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though it is unseen.

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:40.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that means that faith
as described in the Bible

00:17:40.673 --> 00:17:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not unquestioning; it is not irrational;

00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:46.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is not foolish or gullible;

00:17:46.763 --> 00:17:49.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not being quick to believe something

00:17:49.057 --> 00:17:52.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
with little or no evidence.

00:17:52.143 --> 00:17:54.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
True faith comes

00:17:54.145 --> 00:17:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a careful analysis and study

00:17:58.274 --> 00:18:01.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s precious Word, the Bible.

00:18:01.486 --> 00:18:05.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
The accurate knowledge
that we gain from God’s Word

00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:07.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to build our faith.

00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:11.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s there in the Bible
that we learn about God,

00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:13.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn about his name,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn about his promises
that have already come true,

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:20.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we learn about promises that he’s made

00:18:20.046 --> 00:18:23.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
—exciting promises for our future.

00:18:23.842 --> 00:18:27.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
But faith is also built and established
by something else.

00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:29.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:18:29.055 --> 00:18:31.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s creation.

00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:33.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we look up into the night sky

00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:37.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we see the exact order in the universe,

00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:39.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does it make us feel?

00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:42.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or when we look at the human brain
and its complexity

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:45.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the complexity of the human eye,

00:18:45.405 --> 00:18:47.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to come to the conclusion

00:18:47.824 --> 00:18:50.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there must be a Designer.

00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:53.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is strong evidence

00:18:53.205 --> 00:18:56.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an intelligent Creator.

00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:58.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now,

00:18:58.335 --> 00:19:01.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
why is it so important that you and I

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow in our faith and develop faith?

00:19:04.842 --> 00:19:07.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible answers that question too.

00:19:07.094 --> 00:19:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you look with me at Hebrews 11:6?

00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:14.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 11:6, it says:

00:19:14.476 --> 00:19:18.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, without faith it is impossible

00:19:18.272 --> 00:19:21.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[isn’t that interesting? it is impossible]

00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to please God well,

00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:28.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for whoever approaches God
must believe that he is

00:19:28.198 --> 00:19:33.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he becomes the rewarder
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:19:33.203 --> 00:19:34.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did you see the point?

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Without faith it is impossible
to please God.”

00:19:38.834 --> 00:19:41.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
So faith is essential

00:19:41.795 --> 00:19:45.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are going to please God
and have his blessing.

00:19:45.257 --> 00:19:48.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve talked quite a bit
about what faith is,

00:19:48.427 --> 00:19:51.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here are two things that faith is not.

00:19:51.972 --> 00:19:56.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith is not simply believing
that God exists,

00:19:56.102 --> 00:20:00.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Bible says
that even ‘the demons believe in God,

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:02.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they shudder.’

00:20:02.358 --> 00:20:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves coming to know Jehovah,
coming to trust him,

00:20:07.363 --> 00:20:11.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
forming an unbreakable friendship with him,

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:15.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jehovah is so real to us

00:20:15.204 --> 00:20:17.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we sense his love

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sense his approval
in our day-to-day life.

00:20:22.003 --> 00:20:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the other thing that faith is not?

00:20:25.047 --> 00:20:28.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith is not simply hoping for something.

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:31.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible uses the example of Abraham.

00:20:31.721 --> 00:20:33.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Abraham had

00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:37.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
the demonstration of the things
that he hoped for;

00:20:37.226 --> 00:20:40.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had evidence that God was real.

00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:42.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did that affect Abraham?

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result?

00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:46.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read together this important scripture

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:51.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 4:20.

00:20:52.408 --> 00:20:55.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Romans 4:20, it says:

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

00:20:58.665 --> 00:21:00.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he [that is, Abraham]

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:04.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“did not waver in a lack of faith;

00:21:04.337 --> 00:21:06.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but [notice, what did he do?]

00:21:06.673 --> 00:21:10.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he became powerful by his faith,

00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:12.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving God glory.”

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:15.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Abraham was moved;

00:21:15.849 --> 00:21:19.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was motivated; he was empowered.

00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:23.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He became powerful by his faith.”

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:26.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how appropriately, then,

00:21:26.192 --> 00:21:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Romans 4:20 has been chosen

00:21:30.864 --> 00:21:34.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the theme text for this convention.

00:21:34.618 --> 00:21:37.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in a moment, we are going to talk

00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:40.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the power of faith,

00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:44.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
but before we do,
we have a wonderful treat now.

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:46.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please give your attention
to a recorded message

00:21:46.671 --> 00:21:50.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our dear Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body,

00:21:50.675 --> 00:21:55.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he explains to us
how important faith is for Christians today.

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:10.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to the “Powerful by Faith!”

00:22:10.988 --> 00:22:13.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:15.325 line:10% position:50% align:center
You’ll certainly be happy

00:22:15.325 --> 00:22:16.994 line:10% position:50% align:center
that you made the effort to attend

00:22:16.994 --> 00:22:19.454 line:10% position:50% align:center
all three days of this convention.

00:22:20.414 --> 00:22:23.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expression “powerful by faith”

00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
is drawn from the apostle Paul’s words

00:22:26.628 --> 00:22:29.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 4:20.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did the Governing Body choose faith

00:22:32.843 --> 00:22:36.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:38.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we need strong faith

00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:42.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal successfully with our present trials

00:22:42.144 --> 00:22:45.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with those we’ll face in the near future.

00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 17:20,

00:22:49.652 --> 00:22:52.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus assured his disciples:

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:55.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you have faith

00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:57.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the size of a mustard grain,

00:22:57.785 --> 00:23:00.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will say to this mountain,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move,

00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:07.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:23:07.294 --> 00:23:10.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, faith enables us

00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:13.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do things we could never imagine
doing on our own.

00:23:14.635 --> 00:23:19.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Christians, faith is essential.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:23:23.185 --> 00:23:27.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 John 3:23, we read:

00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:31.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, this is his commandment:

00:23:31.694 --> 00:23:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we have faith

00:23:33.696 --> 00:23:36.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the name of his Son Jesus Christ

00:23:36.324 --> 00:23:38.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and love one another,

00:23:38.326 --> 00:23:41.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he gave us a commandment.”

00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:46.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Hebrews 11:6 tells us:

00:23:46.918 --> 00:23:48.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Without faith

00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:51.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

00:23:51.672 --> 00:23:54.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for whoever approaches God

00:23:54.008 --> 00:23:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“must believe that he is

00:23:56.219 --> 00:23:58.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:23:58.554 --> 00:24:01.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:24:02.433 --> 00:24:05.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, to receive Jehovah’s blessing

00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:08.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gain the reward of everlasting life,

00:24:08.648 --> 00:24:13.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to build and maintain faith.

00:24:14.362 --> 00:24:17.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Romans 1:17,

00:24:17.574 --> 00:24:20.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
quoting the prophet Habakkuk, Paul wrote:

00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:24.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous one will live

00:24:24.122 --> 00:24:26.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
by reason of faith.”

00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:30.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
With these words, Paul emphasized

00:24:30.086 --> 00:24:34.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will reward
all who show real faith.

00:24:34.632 --> 00:24:37.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on our faith in Jesus’ ransom,

00:24:37.135 --> 00:24:39.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah forgives our sins

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:43.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grants us a righteous standing
with him even now.

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:44.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during Armageddon,

00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:47.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will protect God’s people

00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:50.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then give them the opportunity

00:24:50.315 --> 00:24:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live forever in Paradise.

00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:56.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we want for all of you.

00:24:56.196 --> 00:24:58.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us here today

00:24:58.323 --> 00:25:01.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
already have a large measure of faith,

00:25:01.034 --> 00:25:03.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as Paul wrote

00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:06.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Corinthians 1:24:

00:25:07.332 --> 00:25:11.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is by your faith that you are standing.”

00:25:12.003 --> 00:25:14.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reports from around the globe

00:25:14.172 --> 00:25:16.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
testify to your genuine faith

00:25:16.383 --> 00:25:20.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing
through you

00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:22.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of your faith.

00:25:22.764 --> 00:25:25.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel as Paul expressed

00:25:25.392 --> 00:25:29.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Colossians 1:3, 4:

00:25:29.646 --> 00:25:32.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We always thank God,

00:25:32.482 --> 00:25:35.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when we pray for you,

00:25:37.196 --> 00:25:40.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

00:25:40.324 --> 00:25:44.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love you have for all the holy ones.”

00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:48.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
But constant pressure
from Satan and the demons,

00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:52.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
the old world, and our own imperfections

00:25:52.169 --> 00:25:56.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:25:56.423 --> 00:25:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose of this convention

00:25:58.634 --> 00:26:01.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to strengthen that faith.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how to cultivate true faith,

00:26:04.932 --> 00:26:07.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to exercise it in our daily lives,

00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:11.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to maintain it
during difficult times.

00:26:11.438 --> 00:26:13.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please

00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:17.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
pay close attention
to each part of the program.

00:26:17.653 --> 00:26:21.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
As scriptures are read,
follow along in the Bible.

00:26:21.907 --> 00:26:24.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may God’s Word empower you

00:26:24.743 --> 00:26:29.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be a man, woman, or child of faith!

00:26:31.375 --> 00:26:34.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Jackson.

00:26:34.128 --> 00:26:37.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s come back now
to the point we were discussing.

00:26:37.256 --> 00:26:41.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the power of faith?

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, to open this discussion,
let’s open our Bibles

00:26:44.639 --> 00:26:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s go to Matthew chapter 17

00:26:48.184 --> 00:26:51.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together verses 19 and 20.

00:26:51.938 --> 00:26:55.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Matthew 17:19, 20:

00:26:56.651 --> 00:27:00.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the disciples came to Jesus privately
and said:

00:27:00.988 --> 00:27:03.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Why could we not expel it?’

00:27:03.574 --> 00:27:08.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to them:
‘Because of your little faith.

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:10.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For truly I say to you,

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:15.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘if you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:27:15.044 --> 00:27:17.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you will say to this mountain,

00:27:17.338 --> 00:27:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Move from here to there,”

00:27:20.299 --> 00:27:23.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and it will move,

00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:27.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.’”

00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:28.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:27:28.641 --> 00:27:32.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that faith is powerful.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:
“Nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:27:36.858 --> 00:27:38.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just as Peter

00:27:38.902 --> 00:27:41.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his faith
was able to get out of the boat

00:27:41.362 --> 00:27:43.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and walk on the water,

00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:46.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith can enable us to do things

00:27:46.576 --> 00:27:48.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that from a human perspective

00:27:48.578 --> 00:27:52.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
seem to be completely impossible.

00:27:52.373 --> 00:27:56.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider six different things.

00:27:56.044 --> 00:27:58.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the first one:

00:27:58.588 --> 00:28:03.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith opens up the privilege
of being able to walk

00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:07.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our wonderful, amazing God, Jehovah.

00:28:07.722 --> 00:28:09.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:28:09.724 --> 00:28:13.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible says
that men of faith like Noah

00:28:13.186 --> 00:28:15.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“walked with the true God.”

00:28:15.188 --> 00:28:18.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does it mean when it says that?

00:28:18.358 --> 00:28:23.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Noah followed
Jehovah’s commandments and instructions

00:28:23.363 --> 00:28:25.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
so carefully

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Noah loved Jehovah so much

00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:33.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was just as though Noah and Jehovah

00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:36.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
were walking down the street together

00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:40.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the closest and most intimate of friends.

00:28:40.422 --> 00:28:45.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is something that faith
made possible for Noah.

00:28:45.427 --> 00:28:50.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
But brothers and sisters, here’s
the really wonderful and amazing thing:

00:28:50.265 --> 00:28:52.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was true for Noah,

00:28:52.851 --> 00:28:57.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s also true for you,
and it’s also true for me.

00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:01.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
We too can experience what seems impossible

00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:06.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be actually walking
with our heavenly Father day by day.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the power of faith.

00:29:09.118 --> 00:29:11.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at a second one:

00:29:11.954 --> 00:29:16.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith moves us to obey the commands of God

00:29:16.083 --> 00:29:18.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
without hesitation.

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:21.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as an example, we think of Abraham.

00:29:21.338 --> 00:29:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s called in the scriptures
“the father of all those having faith.”

00:29:26.844 --> 00:29:29.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how is Abraham an example?

00:29:29.263 --> 00:29:32.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he was quick to obey Jehovah

00:29:32.683 --> 00:29:35.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when Jehovah asked him to do things

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were very difficult, like leaving Ur

00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:42.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and offering up his only son.

00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:46.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham was willing to obey
because of his faith.

00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:48.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, brothers, think

00:29:48.783 --> 00:29:52.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
—think about what this makes possible today.

00:29:53.204 --> 00:29:57.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
People who have been addicted
to drugs, to tobacco,

00:29:57.208 --> 00:30:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
to alcohol, to gambling, to pornography;

00:30:01.671 --> 00:30:05.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who have been living
immoral lifestyles of all sorts;

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who have said they would
never be able to give up those habits

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that they would never be able
to change their lifestyle—

00:30:12.765 --> 00:30:14.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened?

00:30:14.809 --> 00:30:16.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
As they developed faith,

00:30:16.936 --> 00:30:20.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
through their faith and through their desire
to please Jehovah,

00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:24.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
they broke free from all of those things.

00:30:24.861 --> 00:30:27.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have seen people like that.

00:30:27.196 --> 00:30:29.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have seen them.
I have seen them.

00:30:29.574 --> 00:30:32.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that people like this

00:30:32.452 --> 00:30:35.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
have conquered all of these bad things

00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:37.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of their faith.

00:30:37.582 --> 00:30:41.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you are one of those people.

00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:43.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:30:43.087 --> 00:30:46.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is the real power of faith

00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:50.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not something theoretical,
not something imagined,

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in action.

00:30:52.263 --> 00:30:55.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
People experience that power

00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:57.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their own lives.

00:30:57.936 --> 00:31:00.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to the third one:

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:03.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith in the fulfillment
of Jehovah’s promises

00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:08.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
moves us to want to go out
and preach the good news of God’s Kingdom.

00:31:08.696 --> 00:31:11.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, let’s read
what the Scriptures say about this.

00:31:11.324 --> 00:31:16.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Corinthians 4:13,

00:31:17.414 --> 00:31:19.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says there:

00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:23.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now because we have the same spirit of faith

00:31:23.003 --> 00:31:25.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as that of which it is written:

00:31:25.171 --> 00:31:27.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I exercised faith,

00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:29.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“therefore I spoke’;

00:31:29.968 --> 00:31:32.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we too exercise faith

00:31:32.596 --> 00:31:35.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore we speak.”

00:31:35.432 --> 00:31:37.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does it mean?

00:31:37.726 --> 00:31:42.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without faith, without exercising faith
in the promises of God,

00:31:42.522 --> 00:31:45.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would never ever be able to do
the preaching work.

00:31:45.859 --> 00:31:50.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, maybe when you were first studying
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:31:50.864 --> 00:31:55.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe you said something like this:
‘I’ll never go from door to door.

00:31:55.786 --> 00:32:00.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll never see me walking down the street,
knocking on doors.’

00:32:00.165 --> 00:32:02.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened?

00:32:02.167 --> 00:32:04.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you grew in your faith,

00:32:04.753 --> 00:32:07.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
you wanted to share
the things that you were learning

00:32:07.297 --> 00:32:11.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you wanted to talk
about all the wonderful things

00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:13.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you were hearing about Jehovah.

00:32:13.345 --> 00:32:16.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, faith helps us conquer our fears.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us overcome shyness.

00:32:18.642 --> 00:32:22.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us overcome indifference
in the territory.

00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:25.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us overcome opposition

00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:27.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even government bans.

00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:30.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hitler, Stalin,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Soviet Union, and even Russia today

00:32:33.615 --> 00:32:38.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of them have said that they
would crush Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they would put an end
to our preaching.

00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:44.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened?

00:32:44.668 --> 00:32:48.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters kept on preaching

00:32:48.339 --> 00:32:51.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite whatever opposition came,

00:32:51.342 --> 00:32:53.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our brothers today

00:32:53.344 --> 00:32:56.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are living
under similar circumstances under ban

00:32:56.472 --> 00:32:58.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue preaching also.

00:32:58.808 --> 00:33:01.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
They do not give up.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:33:02.478 --> 00:33:05.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are they able to keep going?

00:33:05.147 --> 00:33:08.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the power of faith.

00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:11.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith moves them to action

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to continue telling the good news,

00:33:14.281 --> 00:33:16.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what the circumstances may be.

00:33:17.785 --> 00:33:19.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go on to the fourth point:

00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:24.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith moves us to act in ways

00:33:24.584 --> 00:33:26.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
that bring blessings to us.

00:33:26.877 --> 00:33:28.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about this:

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people who saw and heard

00:33:31.632 --> 00:33:33.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
the teaching of Jesus and his works

00:33:33.968 --> 00:33:36.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
put faith in him.

00:33:36.262 --> 00:33:40.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
They believed that Jesus
was able to heal them,

00:33:40.475 --> 00:33:43.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so that faith led to blessings.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in what way?

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, sometimes when Jesus
healed individuals, what did he say?

00:33:49.901 --> 00:33:53.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Your faith has made you well.”

00:33:53.529 --> 00:33:55.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, if those people

00:33:55.865 --> 00:33:58.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
had not exercised faith in Jesus,

00:33:58.493 --> 00:34:00.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would not have come to him

00:34:00.662 --> 00:34:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they would never have experienced

00:34:02.705 --> 00:34:05.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
the healing that he gave them.

00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:07.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:34:07.961 --> 00:34:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we are not looking
to be physically healed

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
through our faith in Jesus,

00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:18.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
but many of us have made major decisions

00:34:18.513 --> 00:34:21.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
—made major changes in our lives—

00:34:21.182 --> 00:34:24.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to become disciples of Christ.

00:34:24.185 --> 00:34:28.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we left promising careers;
perhaps we left fame;

00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:33.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps we gave up higher education,
or whatever it may be.

00:34:33.194 --> 00:34:37.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is the promise
that Jesus made to all of us

00:34:37.866 --> 00:34:41.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have made these decisions
based on faith?

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:46.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Mark 10:29, look what Jesus said:

00:34:47.459 --> 00:34:50.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No one has left house

00:34:50.503 --> 00:34:53.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or brothers or sisters

00:34:53.423 --> 00:34:56.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or mother or father or children

00:34:56.635 --> 00:35:01.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or fields for my sake
and for the sake of the good news

00:35:01.014 --> 00:35:05.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who will not get 100 times more

00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:08.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now in this period of time

00:35:09.773 --> 00:35:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—houses, brothers, sisters,

00:35:13.068 --> 00:35:15.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“mothers, children, and fields,

00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:18.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with persecutions—

00:35:18.031 --> 00:35:21.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the coming system of things,
everlasting life.”

00:35:21.952 --> 00:35:23.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:25.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we’ve made these decisions.

00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:28.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may have walked away
from many things in the world,

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:32.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by putting faith in Christ Jesus,

00:35:32.045 --> 00:35:36.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
what amazing blessings have come to us,
just like Jesus said

00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:41.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“100 times more”
than what we have given up!

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:44.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the power of faith.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at number five:

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:50.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith helps us to win our struggle

00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:54.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
against the superhuman spirit forces.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, how so?

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:59.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read together Ephesians 6

00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:04.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 16.

00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:09.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 6:16,

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:12.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Besides all of this,

00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:16.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“take up the large shield of faith,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with which you will be able to extinguish

00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:23.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the wicked one’s burning arrows.”

00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:25.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, what is the point?

00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:29.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that here
in Ephesians chapter 6,

00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:32.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
faith is compared to a “large shield”?

00:36:32.064 --> 00:36:36.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like a large shield
that covers most of the body,

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:41.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
faith in Jehovah God
and his promises for the future

00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:45.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
can shield us from
—what does it say in verse 16?—

00:36:45.494 --> 00:36:50.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all the wicked one’s burning arrows.”

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:53.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be completely protected.

00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:55.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:59.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that through our faith,
we have the power

00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get up and turn off that television.

00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:06.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the power to walk out
of that movie theater.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:11.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the power to unplug
that computer, if necessary,

00:37:11.187 --> 00:37:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get rid of those temptations or bad ideas

00:37:15.692 --> 00:37:20.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could motivate us to enter
into a course of wrongdoing.

00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:25.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is no wonder that 1 Thessalonians 5:8

00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:28.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
compares faith to a “breastplate”

00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:30.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can protect our figurative heart

00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:34.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
from temptation and from the power of sin.

00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:38.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is real power.

00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:40.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s go to our sixth point:

00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:44.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith moves us to trust

00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:48.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our prayers to Jehovah God are heard

00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:50.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Jehovah will answer them

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they are in harmony with his will.

00:37:53.647 --> 00:37:55.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jesus said.

00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:57.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you read it with me?

00:37:57.108 --> 00:38:01.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Mark 11:24.

00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:06.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “This is why I tell you,

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:10.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all the things you pray and ask for,

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:13.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have faith that you have received them,

00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:16.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have them.”

00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:20.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, brothers, when we have that faith

00:38:20.841 --> 00:38:23.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the things we are asking Jehovah,

00:38:23.427 --> 00:38:26.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s hearing us and he’s listening to us,

00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:30.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially during these troubled times
—in the midst of this pandemic—

00:38:30.392 --> 00:38:33.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we have many anxieties and concerns.

00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:36.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful that we can believe

00:38:36.231 --> 00:38:38.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah God is hearing us

00:38:38.442 --> 00:38:41.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he is going to provide
an answer to us,

00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:46.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
just exactly in harmony with what we need!

00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:48.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after considering

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:51.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
these six different factors,

00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:56.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
wouldn’t you agree with me
that faith is powerful?

00:38:56.168 --> 00:38:58.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has real power

00:38:58.212 --> 00:39:01.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make things that seem impossible to men

00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:06.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
become realities for those
who have faith in Jehovah.

00:39:07.763 --> 00:39:12.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how thankful we can be
that Jehovah is helping us

00:39:12.017 --> 00:39:15.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
to develop this wonderful quality

00:39:15.187 --> 00:39:17.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
through solid evidence,

00:39:17.356 --> 00:39:19.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
through accurate knowledge,

00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:23.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and through his precious holy spirit!

00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:26.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that brings us to that third question:

00:39:26.866 --> 00:39:29.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we build up our faith?

00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:32.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe more specifically,
How is this convention

00:39:32.955 --> 00:39:35.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
going to help us to build our faith?

00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:38.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, the convention
is going to include many talks,

00:39:38.794 --> 00:39:41.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
symposiums, interviews,

00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:43.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to have
a two-part Bible drama.

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:47.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there is much to look forward to.

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:49.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
But maybe just for a few minutes,

00:39:49.221 --> 00:39:51.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you open up your program,
perhaps on your device

00:39:51.932 --> 00:39:54.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I’m using here today?

00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:56.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s consider some of the highlights

00:39:56.979 --> 00:40:00.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can expect to see in our convention.

00:40:00.316 --> 00:40:03.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’ll notice that on day one,

00:40:03.027 --> 00:40:07.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
the theme for the day is from Luke 17:5:

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:40:10.076 --> 00:40:14.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to strengthen
your relationship with Jehovah?

00:40:14.122 --> 00:40:17.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, pay attention
to the dramatic Bible reading.

00:40:17.416 --> 00:40:21.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where we’re going to learn
about how faith

00:40:21.087 --> 00:40:24.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved Noah to be able to obey Jehovah,

00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:28.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though the things Jehovah
asked of him were very, very large.

00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:32.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take notice of that audio drama.

00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:34.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in the afternoon—

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:38.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a person
that loves Jehovah’s creation?

00:40:38.146 --> 00:40:40.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the second symposium of our convention,

00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:44.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith,”

00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:46.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to show us how Jehovah’s love,

00:40:46.988 --> 00:40:49.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
his wisdom, and his power

00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:52.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
are reflected in all the beautiful things
that he made.

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:54.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s going to show us also

00:40:54.746 --> 00:40:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah not only has the ability
but the desire

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:01.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fulfill his promises for the future.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then how about this?

00:41:03.797 --> 00:41:06.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
How strong is your faith?

00:41:06.716 --> 00:41:10.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, take notice of the final talk
on Friday afternoon.

00:41:10.095 --> 00:41:12.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where we’re going to hear the talk

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Keep Testing Whether You Are in the Faith’
—How?”

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:19.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll give us an opportunity
to look at our own faith

00:41:19.729 --> 00:41:22.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see just how strong it is.

00:41:22.691 --> 00:41:25.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to day two.

00:41:25.318 --> 00:41:29.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we see that the theme for the day
is going to be Jude 3:

00:41:29.197 --> 00:41:32.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith.”

00:41:32.909 --> 00:41:36.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you begun to use
our new study publication,

00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:38.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>?

00:41:38.707 --> 00:41:41.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll all want
to listen carefully to the talk

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:45.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Build Faith Using <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>”

00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:49.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s going to discuss
how we can use this new study publication

00:41:49.634 --> 00:41:52.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach the heart of our student

00:41:52.012 --> 00:41:56.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to help our student to build faith.

00:41:57.643 --> 00:41:59.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within Jehovah’s organization,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:04.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have many brothers and sisters
who have unbelieving mates,

00:42:04.024 --> 00:42:07.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have many who are part
of single-parent families,

00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:10.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have many who are single.

00:42:11.073 --> 00:42:13.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
The symposium entitled

00:42:13.117 --> 00:42:16.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith”

00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:19.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to show us what we can learn

00:42:19.331 --> 00:42:21.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
from these faithful Christians.

00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:23.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take note!

00:42:23.085 --> 00:42:25.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then looking in the afternoon,

00:42:25.754 --> 00:42:28.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
although we can’t travel right now,

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to have the opportunity
to go on an around-the-world tour

00:42:32.553 --> 00:42:35.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the video
<i>How Our Brothers Are Showing Faith in . . .</i>

00:42:35.723 --> 00:42:38.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to take us all around the world

00:42:38.183 --> 00:42:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and show us how our brothers
are manifesting faith

00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:45.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many, many different parts
of this beautiful earth.

00:42:45.691 --> 00:42:50.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then you are all in for an amazing treat

00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:53.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Part I of the Bible drama

00:42:53.574 --> 00:42:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:42:56.285 --> 00:42:59.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I think I can say confidently

00:42:59.538 --> 00:43:03.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is absolutely the best drama

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have ever produced.

00:43:05.086 --> 00:43:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are going to love it!

00:43:07.755 --> 00:43:10.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the last talk on day two
is a serious one.

00:43:10.925 --> 00:43:15.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to contrast faith destroyers
with faith builders,

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s going to show us
how we can strengthen our trust

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:24.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s Word
and also in his organization.

00:43:24.146 --> 00:43:26.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, finally, on day three,

00:43:26.274 --> 00:43:29.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
our theme is going to be Matthew 21:21:

00:43:29.861 --> 00:43:33.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

00:43:33.322 --> 00:43:35.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to look at what we can learn

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
from faithful women of God.

00:43:39.036 --> 00:43:42.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll notice,
there is an eight-part symposium

00:43:42.415 --> 00:43:47.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows us how the women
featured in each talk showed faith

00:43:47.337 --> 00:43:51.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also how we can imitate their faith.

00:43:51.174 --> 00:43:54.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in the afternoon,
we have the thrilling finale

00:43:54.677 --> 00:43:59.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
of that Bible drama
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, then, the convention
will conclude all too soon

00:44:03.895 --> 00:44:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the very motivating and moving talk

00:44:06.689 --> 00:44:10.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Become Powerful by Your Faith!”

00:44:10.568 --> 00:44:12.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers, would you like to see

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
just a taste of what’s in store

00:44:14.823 --> 00:44:16.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of the videos
we’re going to be seeing?

00:44:16.866 --> 00:44:18.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:44:23.581 --> 00:44:25.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:44:26.167 --> 00:44:30.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:44:32.007 --> 00:44:35.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:44:35.552 --> 00:44:37.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:44:40.223 --> 00:44:43.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:44:43.602 --> 00:44:44.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
But

00:44:44.895 --> 00:44:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:44:49.065 --> 00:44:52.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was as if a veil had been lifted
from my eyes.

00:44:52.986 --> 00:44:54.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the moment

00:44:54.696 --> 00:44:56.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:44:58.867 --> 00:45:01.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my darkest times,

00:45:01.244 --> 00:45:03.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:45:09.586 --> 00:45:10.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew these words

00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:12.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
would build my faith.

00:45:14.299 --> 00:45:16.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

00:45:16.677 --> 00:45:17.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do what is good.”

00:45:21.515 --> 00:45:25.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, doesn’t that whet your appetite
for what is coming at this convention?

00:45:25.727 --> 00:45:30.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, keep in mind that some of the videos
at the convention present real accounts,

00:45:30.482 --> 00:45:33.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
but many others are just dramatizations.

00:45:33.527 --> 00:45:35.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:45:35.529 --> 00:45:39.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the dramatizations don’t portray
real people or real events,

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they depict situations
that help to teach us the truth.

00:45:45.998 --> 00:45:49.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God loves and appreciates

00:45:49.209 --> 00:45:51.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
men and women of faith

00:45:51.211 --> 00:45:54.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
—men and women just like you.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is determined to reward
men and women like that

00:45:58.385 --> 00:46:00.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an amazing reward.

00:46:00.387 --> 00:46:01.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you read it with me?

00:46:01.597 --> 00:46:05.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at John 6:40.

00:46:06.185 --> 00:46:09.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 6:40, it says:

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this is the will of my Father,

00:46:12.399 --> 00:46:15.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that everyone who recognizes the Son

00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:18.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and exercises faith in him

00:46:18.239 --> 00:46:21.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should have everlasting life,

00:46:21.867 --> 00:46:26.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will resurrect him on the last day.”

00:46:26.288 --> 00:46:29.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those “[exercising] faith”

00:46:29.208 --> 00:46:32.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be certain of receiving this reward.

00:46:32.378 --> 00:46:35.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 3:36, Jesus said:

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who exercises faith in the Son

00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:43.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
has [has] everlasting life.”

00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:46.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
So dear brothers and sisters,

00:46:46.184 --> 00:46:49.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we begin this wonderful convention,

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
please be determined to take notes.

00:46:53.441 --> 00:46:55.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be determined to meditate

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the things that you will hear

00:46:58.029 --> 00:47:01.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you may cultivate, maintain,

00:47:01.657 --> 00:47:04.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthen your faith.

00:47:04.535 --> 00:47:07.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you do, you too will become

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:10.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
powerful by faith

00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:13.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and receive the wonderful, amazing reward

00:47:13.294 --> 00:47:15.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
of everlasting life!

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Sanderson,
for laying a foundation

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the program parts to follow.

00:47:23.054 --> 00:47:27.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are confident that each session
will help us strengthen our faith.

00:47:28.685 --> 00:47:31.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Real faith is based on evidence.

00:47:31.729 --> 00:47:34.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first symposium of this convention,

00:47:34.149 --> 00:47:38.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will examine evidence
that provides the basis for our faith.

00:47:39.154 --> 00:47:40.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother David Schafer,

00:47:40.488 --> 00:47:43.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Teaching
Committee of the Governing Body,

00:47:43.533 --> 00:47:45.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
will begin with the talk

00:47:45.869 --> 00:47:50.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Existence.”

00:47:50.665 --> 00:47:53.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each speaker will then introduce
the one to follow.

00:48:00.258 --> 00:48:04.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does something exist
because you believe it does?

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does something not exist
simply because you don’t believe in it?

00:48:09.684 --> 00:48:10.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:13.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is based on evidence.

00:48:13.772 --> 00:48:18.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what kind of evidence convinces you
that something exists?

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
We believe in many things we can’t see

00:48:21.613 --> 00:48:25.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
—air, wind, atoms, electricity,
gravity, time.

00:48:25.534 --> 00:48:28.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we believe in things we can’t hear

00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:32.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
—galaxies, dog whistles, microorganisms.

00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:35.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also believe in things we can’t feel,

00:48:35.794 --> 00:48:39.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as our brain
or the rotation of the earth.

00:48:39.339 --> 00:48:40.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why?

00:48:40.924 --> 00:48:43.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
What convinces you?

00:48:43.552 --> 00:48:48.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
The effects
—effects that you can see, hear,

00:48:48.557 --> 00:48:51.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel, and measure—

00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:54.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the testimony
from those who know the facts.

00:48:54.605 --> 00:48:59.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidence
—evidence is the basis for faith.

00:49:00.569 --> 00:49:05.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, many people don’t believe
that God exists.

00:49:05.574 --> 00:49:07.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their lack of faith can affect us.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, our faith is under attack.

00:49:10.579 --> 00:49:14.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium will remind us
of our reasons for faith

00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:17.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will help us to strengthen our faith.

00:49:17.795 --> 00:49:22.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll consider why we have faith
in God’s existence,

00:49:22.591 --> 00:49:26.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his Word, in his moral standards,

00:49:26.137 --> 00:49:28.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in his love.

00:49:28.681 --> 00:49:33.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, why is faith in God’s existence
important?

00:49:33.686 --> 00:49:37.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please find Ephesians chapter 2,

00:49:37.857 --> 00:49:42.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice how the apostle Paul describes
Christians in Ephesus

00:49:42.653 --> 00:49:45.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
before they knew the true God.

00:49:45.823 --> 00:49:50.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 2:1 reads:

00:49:50.786 --> 00:49:53.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, God made you alive,

00:49:53.956 --> 00:49:58.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
though you were dead
in your trespasses and sins.”

00:49:58.419 --> 00:50:00.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 12 continues:

00:50:00.421 --> 00:50:04.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time you were without Christ,

00:50:04.425 --> 00:50:07.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“alienated from the state of Israel,

00:50:07.512 --> 00:50:11.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“strangers to the covenants of the promise;

00:50:11.516 --> 00:50:16.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
you had no hope
and were without God in the world.”

00:50:16.521 --> 00:50:18.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same was true for us.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:22.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
But faith in the existence of the Creator

00:50:22.276 --> 00:50:25.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
has given our lives meaning and purpose.

00:50:25.196 --> 00:50:28.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has unlocked the answers
to such questions as,

00:50:28.324 --> 00:50:33.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why does the universe exist?’
and ‘What does the future hold?’

00:50:33.288 --> 00:50:35.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, there are people
who shy away from such questions,

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:39.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking that the answers are just beyond us.

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:41.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even teach that there is no purpose,

00:50:41.379 --> 00:50:44.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
no ultimate meaning in life.

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:46.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But where does that leave them?

00:50:46.259 --> 00:50:49.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without reliable guidance.

00:50:49.053 --> 00:50:53.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, notice what Psalm 111:10

00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:57.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
teaches us about the effect of our faith.

00:50:57.645 --> 00:51:02.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 111:10 says:

00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:05.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fear of Jehovah

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the beginning of wisdom.

00:51:08.281 --> 00:51:10.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All those observing his orders

00:51:10.825 --> 00:51:13.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“show good insight.

00:51:13.495 --> 00:51:16.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
His praise endures forever.”

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:20.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, clear thinking
and practical application of knowledge

00:51:20.627 --> 00:51:24.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
begin with regarding the Creator with awe

00:51:24.798 --> 00:51:27.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
and profound respect.

00:51:27.175 --> 00:51:29.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as indicated in the very next verse,

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:32.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
this makes us happier people.

00:51:32.472 --> 00:51:34.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need to safeguard our faith.

00:51:34.933 --> 00:51:38.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the foundation
for our relationship with God,

00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:43.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
the basis for our hope,
the key to our future.

00:51:43.108 --> 00:51:45.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s remind ourselves

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we can have faith in God’s existence.

00:51:49.364 --> 00:51:53.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to the chapter of the Bible
that defines faith

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:56.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Hebrews chapter 11.

00:51:56.038 --> 00:51:59.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:1 tells us

00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:03.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
that faith is the convincing evidence

00:52:03.754 --> 00:52:06.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
of “realities that are not seen.”

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what would be an example of that?

00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:13.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read together Hebrews 11:3.

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:18.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “By faith we perceive

00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:23.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the systems of things
were put in order by God’s word,

00:52:23.107 --> 00:52:27.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that what is seen has come into existence

00:52:27.319 --> 00:52:31.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
from things that are not visible.”

00:52:31.824 --> 00:52:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The systems of things”

00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:37.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what might be some of those systems?

00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:40.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could this include our solar system

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and the galactic system that it’s a part of—

00:52:42.668 --> 00:52:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the smaller cycles
that occur within our solar system?

00:52:47.423 --> 00:52:52.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about our earth’s atmosphere,
which protects us from the sun’s harmful rays

00:52:52.303 --> 00:52:57.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
while at the same time allowing the entry
of essential heat and light.

00:52:57.183 --> 00:52:59.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think what would happen to us

00:52:59.185 --> 00:53:03.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
were it not for our atmosphere’s
protective shield.

00:53:03.356 --> 00:53:05.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d burn up in seconds.

00:53:05.775 --> 00:53:09.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
And besides blocking out harmful rays,

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
the atmosphere,
along with earth’s magnetic field,

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:16.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
also absorbs much of the debris
that flies through space.

00:53:16.661 --> 00:53:21.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
By faith, we perceive that these “systems”

00:53:21.666 --> 00:53:24.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
were put in order by God’s word.

00:53:24.961 --> 00:53:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or think about the earth’s amazing cycles.

00:53:27.797 --> 00:53:32.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine what would happen
if a city’s water supply

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s fresh air, it’s water—

00:53:35.847 --> 00:53:39.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
were disrupted and the sewers were blocked?

00:53:39.392 --> 00:53:43.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would be
the quality of life in that city?

00:53:43.354 --> 00:53:47.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, our planet is a closed system.

00:53:47.692 --> 00:53:51.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clean air and water
are not shipped in from outer space.

00:53:51.571 --> 00:53:54.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Waste matter is not rocketed out.

00:53:54.657 --> 00:53:59.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does the earth
remain healthy and habitable?

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
The water cycle,

00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:05.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
the carbon and oxygen cycles,
and the nitrogen cycle

00:54:05.293 --> 00:54:10.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all tuned precisely to sustain life.

00:54:10.298 --> 00:54:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, this doesn’t mean that we can be
careless stewards of our planet.

00:54:14.803 --> 00:54:17.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what remarkable systems!

00:54:17.222 --> 00:54:18.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
And much more could be said

00:54:18.932 --> 00:54:22.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the earth’s perfect location
in our solar system

00:54:22.185 --> 00:54:25.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
or about the planet’s perfect orbit, tilt,

00:54:25.272 --> 00:54:28.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
rotational speed, an unusual moon,

00:54:28.024 --> 00:54:32.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
or about our solar system’s perfect position
in the Milky Way.

00:54:32.654 --> 00:54:36.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are all of these precise locations
and elegant measurements

00:54:36.449 --> 00:54:38.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
the result of blind chance

00:54:38.994 --> 00:54:43.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
or of purposeful design?

00:54:43.206 --> 00:54:45.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:54:45.876 --> 00:54:50.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
note yet another example
of how the order evident in creation

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
clearly points to an all-wise Creator.

00:54:57.554 --> 00:55:01.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:55:02.976 --> 00:55:05.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, each individual cell

00:55:05.729 --> 00:55:08.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a marvel of design and organization.

00:55:09.942 --> 00:55:11.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inside our cells,

00:55:11.944 --> 00:55:15.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
biological processes signal specific proteins

00:55:15.739 --> 00:55:18.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assemble themselves into tracks

00:55:18.116 --> 00:55:20.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
called microtubules.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tiny molecular machines called kinesins

00:55:25.207 --> 00:55:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
then transport various components

00:55:27.209 --> 00:55:29.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
to different parts of the cell

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:33.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
by “walking” along the tracks.

00:55:35.968 --> 00:55:38.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
From microscopic proteins

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:44.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enormous galaxies,

00:55:45.519 --> 00:55:48.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
our organized universe abounds

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
with examples of elegant design.

00:55:57.615 --> 00:56:02.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you strengthen your faith
in God’s existence?

00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:05.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider three things that we can do.

00:56:05.623 --> 00:56:09.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles to Romans chapter 1.

00:56:09.794 --> 00:56:12.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we consider examples like these,

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s power and wisdom,

00:56:14.965 --> 00:56:16.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t that make us wonder,

00:56:16.967 --> 00:56:19.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How could anyone deny the evidence

00:56:19.345 --> 00:56:22.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an intelligent and loving Designer?’

00:56:22.473 --> 00:56:24.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 1:18 indicates

00:56:24.725 --> 00:56:29.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
that such denial
requires suppressing the truth.

00:56:29.564 --> 00:56:30.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:56:30.648 --> 00:56:34.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what it says at Romans 1:19:

00:56:36.028 --> 00:56:40.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because what may be known about God

00:56:40.032 --> 00:56:43.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is clearly evident

00:56:43.286 --> 00:56:46.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[clearly evident] among them,

00:56:46.956 --> 00:56:49.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God made it clear to them.”

00:56:49.459 --> 00:56:53.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 20 says:
“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen

00:56:53.921 --> 00:56:56.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the world’s creation onward,

00:56:56.049 --> 00:56:59.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they are perceived
by the things made,

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:02.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even his eternal power and Godship,

00:57:02.013 --> 00:57:06.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they
[namely those who suppress the truth]

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
are inexcusable.”

00:57:08.937 --> 00:57:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s existence and his qualities

00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:16.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
were apparent the moment
mankind first appeared on earth.

00:57:16.819 --> 00:57:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the evidence has only become clearer

00:57:18.905 --> 00:57:21.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the passage of time
and the advancement of technology

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:25.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
that enables us to discover
what God has done.

00:57:25.954 --> 00:57:29.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the first way that we strengthen
our faith in God’s existence

00:57:29.916 --> 00:57:33.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
—through study and meditation—

00:57:33.211 --> 00:57:35.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditating on the evidence.

00:57:35.672 --> 00:57:37.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to help us with this,

00:57:37.757 --> 00:57:42.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find an abundance of published material
about creation on jw.org,

00:57:42.762 --> 00:57:47.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we find brochures,
articles in the series “Was It Designed?”

00:57:47.434 --> 00:57:50.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and interviews with scientists.

00:57:50.353 --> 00:57:53.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second way that we strengthen our faith

00:57:53.064 --> 00:57:56.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by earnestly praying for more faith.

00:57:56.651 --> 00:57:59.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said, as recorded at Luke 11:13,

00:57:59.279 --> 00:58:03.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘God will give his holy spirit
to those asking him for it,’

00:58:03.158 --> 00:58:07.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and part of that spirit’s fruitage is faith.

00:58:07.287 --> 00:58:11.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we strengthen our faith
by building the faith of others.

00:58:11.917 --> 00:58:12.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:17.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
By drawing attention to the evidence
that supports the truth.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:20.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, patiently build
the faith of your children.

00:58:20.634 --> 00:58:24.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they have doubts,
address them promptly, kindly, calmly.

00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:27.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t dismiss their questions,
and don’t get upset.

00:58:27.558 --> 00:58:29.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be glad they asked.

00:58:29.101 --> 00:58:31.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows they care,
and they want to understand.

00:58:31.478 --> 00:58:34.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Accept the challenge; present the evidence.

00:58:34.231 --> 00:58:37.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look for it together
“when you sit in your house . . .

00:58:37.192 --> 00:58:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you walk on the road . . .
when you lie down and when you get up.”

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,
note what strengthens the faith

00:58:45.033 --> 00:58:48.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
of one of our brothers who is a scientist.

00:58:50.289 --> 00:58:52.041 line:10% position:50% align:center
As a mechanical design educator,

00:58:52.041 --> 00:58:53.667 line:10% position:50% align:center
I view even natural things

00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
from a design perspective.

00:58:55.669 --> 00:59:00.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mechanical design considers not only
the individual components of a machine

00:59:00.674 --> 00:59:03.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also how they interact.

00:59:03.385 --> 00:59:06.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
From this viewpoint, human vision

00:59:06.138 --> 00:59:09.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a magnificent example of design.

00:59:11.143 --> 00:59:14.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a single eye,
the cornea, the iris, and the lens

00:59:14.522 --> 00:59:17.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:20.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
The light-sensitive cells of the retina,
called photoreceptors,

00:59:20.611 --> 00:59:22.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
produce nerve signals.

00:59:22.822 --> 00:59:25.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors

00:59:25.741 --> 00:59:29.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
are transmitted by the optic nerve
to the brain,

00:59:29.161 --> 00:59:32.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they are processed
to produce a perceived image.

00:59:32.289 --> 00:59:34.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now just imagine

00:59:34.291 --> 00:59:36.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
the multiplied complexity

00:59:36.669 --> 00:59:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
when two eyes interact.

00:59:39.964 --> 00:59:42.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Particularly mind-boggling is

00:59:42.466 --> 00:59:47.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
the amount of information
being constantly processed

00:59:47.054 --> 00:59:50.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
by more than 130 million retinal receptors

00:59:50.474 --> 00:59:54.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then transmitted
through the 1.2 million nerve fibers

00:59:54.187 --> 00:59:56.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the optic nerve to the brain.

00:59:57.773 --> 01:00:00.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
To me, the sheer complexity

01:00:00.151 --> 01:00:03.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how all these components
flawlessly interact

01:00:03.738 --> 01:00:06.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
is evidence of a superior Designer.

01:00:07.784 --> 01:00:09.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some disagree.

01:00:09.535 --> 01:00:12.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
They propose that the eye evolved

01:00:12.038 --> 01:00:14.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a light-sensitive patch
in some ancestral creature

01:00:14.874 --> 01:00:17.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
through small random changes.

01:00:17.877 --> 01:00:21.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
I find the proposed process unrealistic.

01:00:21.631 --> 01:00:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike design,

01:00:23.633 --> 01:00:27.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is unplanned and without a goal.

01:00:27.095 --> 01:00:30.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are asked to imagine that a complex system

01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:32.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
can develop without direction,

01:00:32.767 --> 01:00:37.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
while in the natural world
things tend to become disorganized.

01:00:37.063 --> 01:00:40.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
But consider something
even more mind-boggling:

01:00:40.275 --> 01:00:43.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
The design of the eye,
the optic nerve, and the brain

01:00:43.862 --> 01:00:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they function and interact

01:00:46.489 --> 01:00:49.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
are completely documented in our DNA.

01:00:49.284 --> 01:00:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, our DNA
contains all the instructions

01:00:53.455 --> 01:00:56.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
for building an entire human body.

01:00:56.499 --> 01:00:58.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
While science relies

01:00:58.043 --> 01:01:01.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
only on physical explanations,

01:01:01.046 --> 01:01:03.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
many individual scientists reason

01:01:03.924 --> 01:01:06.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
that highly ordered natural systems

01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:08.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
are evidence of a Designer.

01:01:08.887 --> 01:01:11.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
My personal conclusion is

01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:13.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is a God who is revealed

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the magnificent designs of nature.

01:01:19.397 --> 01:01:23.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does faith in God’s existence benefit us?

01:01:23.318 --> 01:01:28.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having genuine faith in the loving,
intelligent Designer of this universe

01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:31.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives our lives meaning and purpose.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:36.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
That faith is the basis for obedience
to Jehovah’s righteous standards

01:01:36.206 --> 01:01:38.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—standards that benefit us.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:42.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t fear the future,
because faith gives us hope.

01:01:42.963 --> 01:01:47.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t fear death,
because our hope is in the Source of life.

01:01:47.426 --> 01:01:50.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
How happy we are that Jehovah has provided

01:01:50.804 --> 01:01:53.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
abundant evidence that he exists!

01:01:53.682 --> 01:01:58.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, are there facets
of Jehovah’s personality

01:01:58.687 --> 01:02:02.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we couldn’t fully comprehend
from a study of creation alone?

01:02:02.065 --> 01:02:03.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

01:02:03.066 --> 01:02:07.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for this we need to study
his inspired Word.

01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:11.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we strengthen
our faith in God’s Word?

01:02:11.867 --> 01:02:14.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay careful attention
to Brother Mark Noumair,

01:02:14.953 --> 01:02:16.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he now presents
the next talk of this symposium,

01:02:19.833 --> 01:02:23.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Word.”

01:02:30.469 --> 01:02:34.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you experienced
an unexpected financial setback?

01:02:34.515 --> 01:02:37.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your child struggling
to resist peer pressure

01:02:37.226 --> 01:02:40.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
or unwholesome influences from the Internet?

01:02:40.479 --> 01:02:44.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you been diagnosed
with a life-threatening disease?

01:02:44.817 --> 01:02:48.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life in this wicked system
can seem like a dark wilderness.

01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:51.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may feel alone, discouraged,

01:02:51.073 --> 01:02:53.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
and like we just don’t know where to turn.

01:02:53.659 --> 01:02:55.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is why more than ever,

01:02:55.661 --> 01:02:59.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to strengthen
our faith in God’s Word.

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:01.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we study the Bible and take it to heart,

01:03:01.709 --> 01:03:05.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith in God grows
and something amazing happens.

01:03:05.963 --> 01:03:10.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out what that is
at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

01:03:10.009 --> 01:03:12.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 13

01:03:12.386 --> 01:03:14.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Thessalonians 2:13:

01:03:16.182 --> 01:03:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, that is why

01:03:18.434 --> 01:03:21.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we also thank God unceasingly,

01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:24.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because when you received God’s word,

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:26.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which you heard from us,

01:03:26.192 --> 01:03:29.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you accepted it not as the word of men

01:03:29.529 --> 01:03:32.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but, just as it truthfully is,

01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as the word of God,

01:03:34.701 --> 01:03:38.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is also at work in you believers.”

01:03:39.372 --> 01:03:42.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does God’s Word work in us?

01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:47.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has already transformed us
into faithful servants of Jehovah God,

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:51.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it also gives us
the power to remain strong

01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:54.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
under difficult circumstances.

01:03:54.053 --> 01:03:56.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
This subject is timely

01:03:56.264 --> 01:03:58.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we live in a world where so many

01:03:58.933 --> 01:04:01.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
plant seeds of doubt about the Bible.

01:04:01.144 --> 01:04:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say it is something outdated
or inaccurate.

01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:09.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our determination not to allow
the world’s mistaken views

01:04:09.903 --> 01:04:13.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
to erode our faith in the Bible.

01:04:13.239 --> 01:04:16.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this talk, we’re going to look
at three proofs

01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:19.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us maintain our love and confidence

01:04:19.746 --> 01:04:21.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s inspired Word:

01:04:21.998 --> 01:04:25.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
its prophecies,
what it says about the earth,

01:04:25.544 --> 01:04:28.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its survival against all odds.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take the first point
—Bible prophecies.

01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:34.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beyond man’s reach

01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:38.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the ability
to foresee the future in detail.

01:04:38.473 --> 01:04:40.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only Almighty God can do this.

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, secular history tells us

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in the year 539 B.C.E.,

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:50.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
a man named Cyrus
conquered the land of Babylon

01:04:50.485 --> 01:04:54.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed thousands of Jewish captives
to return home

01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:56.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

01:04:56.992 --> 01:04:59.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible also tells us about these events,

01:04:59.661 --> 01:05:02.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
with one notable exception.

01:05:02.623 --> 01:05:07.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
While secular history recounts these events
after they happened,

01:05:07.502 --> 01:05:11.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible foretold these events
before they took place

01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:14.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in fact, some 200 years before.

01:05:14.384 --> 01:05:17.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a closer look
and see for ourselves.

01:05:17.554 --> 01:05:21.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to Isaiah chapter 44

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah chapter 44—

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:28.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 27 and 28.

01:05:28.065 --> 01:05:31.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read these verses,
please take special notice

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how many times the word “will” appears.

01:05:38.409 --> 01:05:40.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The One saying to the deep waters,

01:05:40.452 --> 01:05:45.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Be evaporated,
and I will dry up all your rivers’;

01:05:45.416 --> 01:05:48.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,

01:05:48.502 --> 01:05:53.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will completely carry out
all my will’;

01:05:53.174 --> 01:05:57.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One saying of Jerusalem,
‘She will be rebuilt,’

01:05:57.344 --> 01:06:01.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of the temple,
‘Your foundation will be laid.’”

01:06:01.974 --> 01:06:04.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t Jehovah God just guessing

01:06:04.518 --> 01:06:07.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
or trying to figure out the future.

01:06:07.104 --> 01:06:09.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s decided what will happen,

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:12.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will make it happen.

01:06:12.276 --> 01:06:15.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could the Bible predict
this kind of detail

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:18.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 200 years in advance?

01:06:18.324 --> 01:06:20.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is only one explanation.

01:06:20.826 --> 01:06:24.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn a couple of chapters over
to Isaiah chapter 46,

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 10.

01:06:29.001 --> 01:06:32.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From the beginning I foretell the outcome,

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:36.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and from long ago
the things that have not yet been done.

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:40.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I say, ‘My decision will stand,

01:06:40.555 --> 01:06:44.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will do whatever I please.’”

01:06:44.851 --> 01:06:47.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s fulfilled prophecies like these

01:06:47.645 --> 01:06:51.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
that build trust and confidence
in God’s Word.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another reason
we have faith in the Bible

01:06:55.903 --> 01:06:58.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because of what it says about the earth.

01:06:58.906 --> 01:07:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider an example at Job chapter 26,

01:07:02.911 --> 01:07:05.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 7.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:09.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job 26:7:

01:07:11.503 --> 01:07:15.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He stretches out the northern sky
over empty space,

01:07:15.882 --> 01:07:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
suspending the earth upon nothing.”

01:07:20.929 --> 01:07:25.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was stated some 3,500 years ago.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:28.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job’s statement
would have appeared ridiculous

01:07:28.687 --> 01:07:30.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Greek philosopher Aristotle,

01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
who taught that an object must rest upon

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be attached to something
or else it will fall.

01:07:36.945 --> 01:07:39.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not until 1687

01:07:39.447 --> 01:07:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the scientist Isaac Newton explained

01:07:42.409 --> 01:07:46.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the earth is held in orbit
by an invisible force

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:50.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
appearing as if it were suspended on nothing.

01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did the Bible know the truth
more than 3,000 years ago?

01:07:54.713 --> 01:07:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer:

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the Word of God,
and “God . . . cannot lie.”

01:08:02.262 --> 01:08:04.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take our third line of evidence,

01:08:04.431 --> 01:08:07.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is the Bible’s survival.

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:12.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the original books of the Bible
have disappeared,

01:08:12.314 --> 01:08:16.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
accurate copies of the Bible manuscripts
have survived to our day

01:08:16.902 --> 01:08:20.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite natural decay, fierce opposition,

01:08:20.155 --> 01:08:23.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deliberate tampering with its message.

01:08:23.325 --> 01:08:26.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 40:8 tells us:

01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:30.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The word of our God endures forever.”

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:34.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible has not endured
as a mere museum display;

01:08:34.795 --> 01:08:37.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
its message has endured.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:39.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
That inspired message

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:42.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been conveyed in over 3,000 languages.

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:47.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is irrefutable proof
of its divine origin.

01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:50.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video
presents additional evidence

01:08:50.936 --> 01:08:53.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible is God’s Word.

01:08:53.731 --> 01:08:55.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay attention to this.

01:08:58.903 --> 01:09:01.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is a book of facts.

01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:04.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s about real people, real events,

01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
real history in real places.

01:09:06.869 --> 01:09:08.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Hebrew Scriptures,

01:09:08.954 --> 01:09:11.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are at least 53 people

01:09:11.624 --> 01:09:14.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
confirmed archaeologically.

01:09:14.293 --> 01:09:17.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example is Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt.

01:09:17.963 --> 01:09:20.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible mentions his invasion of Judah,

01:09:20.633 --> 01:09:22.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifically dating it

01:09:22.802 --> 01:09:26.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the fifth year
of [Judean] King Rehoboam.”

01:09:26.847 --> 01:09:28.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a long time,

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:31.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
the only record of that invasion

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:33.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the one found in the Bible.

01:09:33.938 --> 01:09:37.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a relief on the wall of a temple
at Karnak, Egypt,

01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:39.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
was discovered, depicting

01:09:39.986 --> 01:09:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shishak with captives.

01:09:42.572 --> 01:09:46.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also records names
of conquered Israelite towns,

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:50.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of which have been identified
with Biblical sites.

01:09:50.413 --> 01:09:54.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also mentions the “Field of Abram,”

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:57.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
the earliest reference in Egyptian records

01:09:57.462 --> 01:10:01.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Biblical patriarch Abraham.

01:10:01.966 --> 01:10:05.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
This strengthens our confidence and faith

01:10:05.094 --> 01:10:08.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible as God’s Word.

01:10:08.473 --> 01:10:10.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible was written
on perishable materials,

01:10:10.975 --> 01:10:14.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as papyrus and parchment.

01:10:14.395 --> 01:10:17.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
While no originals are known to exist today,

01:10:17.023 --> 01:10:20.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of ancient copies available now

01:10:20.193 --> 01:10:25.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
is staggering:
some 11,000 Hebrew and Greek manuscripts,

01:10:25.198 --> 01:10:29.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than for any other
ancient piece of literature.

01:10:29.619 --> 01:10:34.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
By comparing the earliest,
most authoritative manuscripts,

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:37.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
scholars can identify inaccuracies

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and mistakes that have crept in.

01:10:40.422 --> 01:10:43.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the vast majority of differences

01:10:43.091 --> 01:10:45.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not change the meaning at all.

01:10:45.593 --> 01:10:48.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example is found at Luke 4:17,

01:10:48.388 --> 01:10:52.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says that Jesus
“opened the scroll” of Isaiah.

01:10:52.809 --> 01:10:54.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some manuscripts say

01:10:54.811 --> 01:10:58.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he “unrolled the scroll.”

01:10:58.023 --> 01:11:00.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t the meaning the same?

01:11:01.651 --> 01:11:05.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s message has even survived
changes in language.

01:11:05.906 --> 01:11:10.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures
quoted the Hebrew Scriptures,

01:11:10.535 --> 01:11:13.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
but often
from the <i>Greek Septuagint</i>  translation.

01:11:13.872 --> 01:11:16.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, they paraphrased such quotations,

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:18.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
using slightly different wording.

01:11:18.835 --> 01:11:21.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the message remained the same.

01:11:21.755 --> 01:11:23.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most of Jesus’ words,

01:11:23.882 --> 01:11:26.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely spoken in first-century Hebrew,

01:11:26.134 --> 01:11:28.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
were recorded in Greek.

01:11:28.553 --> 01:11:31.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, his message is clear.

01:11:31.723 --> 01:11:34.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, at least parts of God’s Word

01:11:34.726 --> 01:11:38.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be read in more than 3,000 languages.

01:11:39.147 --> 01:11:40.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible’s survival reveals

01:11:40.857 --> 01:11:42.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
a puzzling paradox:

01:11:42.526 --> 01:11:44.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout history,

01:11:44.194 --> 01:11:46.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
people were willing to die
to preserve the Bible

01:11:46.905 --> 01:11:49.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make it available to everyone.

01:11:49.616 --> 01:11:51.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others were willing to kill

01:11:51.994 --> 01:11:55.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent access to it
and wipe it out of existence.

01:11:55.247 --> 01:11:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the book’s content.

01:11:59.084 --> 01:12:02.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word “is alive and exerts power.”

01:12:02.379 --> 01:12:04.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
It changes people’s lives

01:12:04.673 --> 01:12:06.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that some welcome

01:12:06.925 --> 01:12:11.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
but others resist—violently at times.

01:12:11.263 --> 01:12:15.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, responding
to Roman Emperor Diocletian’s edict

01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 303 C.E.

01:12:17.853 --> 01:12:20.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to destroy the sacred Scriptures by fire,”

01:12:20.856 --> 01:12:25.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Felix, a bishop of Thibiuca, reportedly said,

01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is better for me to be burned
than the sacred Scriptures.”

01:12:29.031 --> 01:12:32.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
He paid with his life.

01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:36.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Efforts to destroy God’s message for mankind
continue today,

01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:41.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the word of our God endures forever.”

01:12:43.045 --> 01:12:45.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that faith-strengthening

01:12:45.047 --> 01:12:48.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to see more evidence
that the Bible is God’s Word?

01:12:48.718 --> 01:12:51.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we strengthen
our conviction in God’s Word?

01:12:51.929 --> 01:12:56.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do so by creating
study projects to build our faith.

01:12:56.225 --> 01:12:58.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
One fascinating project involves

01:12:58.436 --> 01:13:02.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophecy at Genesis 3:15.

01:13:02.023 --> 01:13:04.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can quote it by heart,

01:13:04.442 --> 01:13:08.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have you ever sat down
and taken the time to make a timeline,

01:13:08.112 --> 01:13:12.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
listing key scriptures that show
how God bit by bit shed light

01:13:12.492 --> 01:13:16.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the individuals and the arrangement
referred to in this verse?

01:13:16.412 --> 01:13:19.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we take time to really study the Bible

01:13:19.374 --> 01:13:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditate on these golden threads
running through the Bible,

01:13:23.586 --> 01:13:27.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith in God’s Word will be strengthened.

01:13:27.006 --> 01:13:29.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you had doubts about something?

01:13:29.133 --> 01:13:30.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then write it down.

01:13:30.927 --> 01:13:34.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then use our research tools
such as the <i>Study Bible</i>,

01:13:34.138 --> 01:13:38.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>JW Library®</i>, <i>Watchtower ONLINE Library</i>®
to dig deeper.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:40.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s worth the effort.

01:13:40.812 --> 01:13:44.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’re a parent,
help your children come to know

01:13:44.274 --> 01:13:48.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fall in love
with the Author of the Bible.

01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so close to begin
the real life in the new world.

01:13:53.616 --> 01:13:58.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to strengthen
our trust and confidence in the Bible.

01:13:58.288 --> 01:14:01.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we have strong faith in God’s Word,

01:14:01.082 --> 01:14:05.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can feel as did our young brother Ruslan
from Turkmenistan

01:14:05.754 --> 01:14:10.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
who faces his second prison term
because of his faith.

01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:12.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
He declared:

01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:16.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have strong faith
that Jehovah will reward me. . . .

01:14:16.473 --> 01:14:20.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where there is a strong hope,
there is endless joy;

01:14:20.101 --> 01:14:23.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where there is joy,
there is strength and endurance.

01:14:23.563 --> 01:14:28.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a strong person can never be broken.”

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too will never be broken

01:14:31.404 --> 01:14:35.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you maintain your faith in God’s Word.

01:14:35.867 --> 01:14:38.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Samuel Herd of the Governing Body

01:14:38.245 --> 01:14:41.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk in this symposium,

01:14:41.748 --> 01:14:46.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why We Have Faith
in . . . God’s Moral Standards.”

01:14:52.759 --> 01:14:57.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pressure from the world can erode
our determination to do what is right.

01:14:57.055 --> 01:14:59.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, even a mature Christian

01:14:59.391 --> 01:15:02.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be inclined to do what is bad.

01:15:02.186 --> 01:15:06.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please find Romans 7:21-23.

01:15:06.231 --> 01:15:09.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul was certainly mature,

01:15:09.318 --> 01:15:12.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
but notice what he said of himself

01:15:12.237 --> 01:15:16.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we read Romans 7:21-23:

01:15:18.327 --> 01:15:21.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I find, then, this law in my case:

01:15:21.538 --> 01:15:23.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I wish to do what is right,

01:15:23.832 --> 01:15:26.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what is bad is present in me.

01:15:26.627 --> 01:15:29.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I really delight in the law of God

01:15:29.088 --> 01:15:31.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to the man I am within,

01:15:31.131 --> 01:15:34.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I see in my body another law

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“warring against the law of my mind

01:15:37.012 --> 01:15:40.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and leading me captive to sin’s law

01:15:40.182 --> 01:15:42.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is in my body.”

01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:47.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Paul, we might find that we have a war, 

01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:49.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a struggle, inside us

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we fight against the law of sin.

01:15:53.237 --> 01:15:55.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, like Paul,

01:15:55.281 --> 01:15:58.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that for us to please Jehovah,

01:15:58.451 --> 01:16:01.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must live in harmony with His standards.

01:16:03.414 --> 01:16:07.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10.

01:16:07.168 --> 01:16:10.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some of Jehovah’s moral standards?

01:16:12.381 --> 01:16:14.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the list of moral issues

01:16:14.508 --> 01:16:17.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we choose not to succumb to.

01:16:18.346 --> 01:16:22.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, it says:

01:16:24.685 --> 01:16:27.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or do you not know that unrighteous people

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:30.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will not inherit God’s Kingdom?

01:16:30.108 --> 01:16:32.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be misled.

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:34.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those who are sexually immoral,

01:16:34.404 --> 01:16:36.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“idolaters, adulterers,

01:16:36.906 --> 01:16:39.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“men who submit to homosexual acts,

01:16:39.826 --> 01:16:42.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“men who practice homosexuality,

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“thieves, greedy people,

01:16:45.248 --> 01:16:48.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“drunkards, revilers, and extortioners

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”

01:16:52.755 --> 01:16:56.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must be firmly convinced
that these moral standards

01:16:56.426 --> 01:16:59.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah are right and beneficial.

01:17:01.139 --> 01:17:04.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we have faith in these standards?

01:17:04.142 --> 01:17:08.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find out, find Isaiah 48:17.

01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:12.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you will see
that we can have faith in God’s standards

01:17:12.817 --> 01:17:16.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they always benefit us.

01:17:18.114 --> 01:17:20.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 48:17 says:

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:23.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,

01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:25.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:

01:17:25.956 --> 01:17:29.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:31.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:17:31.795 --> 01:17:35.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.’”

01:17:36.675 --> 01:17:38.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see the point?

01:17:38.718 --> 01:17:41.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is teaching us

01:17:41.388 --> 01:17:44.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
to benefit ourselves.

01:17:44.099 --> 01:17:48.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can have faith
in his standards of right and wrong.

01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:52.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re unchanging,
and they produce good results

01:17:52.816 --> 01:17:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
under all circumstances and in all cultures.

01:17:57.279 --> 01:18:00.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider God’s standard for marriage.

01:18:00.824 --> 01:18:04.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created marriage as a permanent,

01:18:04.202 --> 01:18:08.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving union between a man and a woman.

01:18:08.457 --> 01:18:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave Adam a wife, Eve

01:18:11.627 --> 01:18:16.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not Eve and B and D—
just Eve.

01:18:16.089 --> 01:18:19.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told them:
“Be fruitful and become many . . .

01:18:19.676 --> 01:18:21.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fill the . . . earth.”

01:18:21.803 --> 01:18:25.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at 1 Corinthians 6:18.

01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:27.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is making the point that sex

01:18:27.893 --> 01:18:32.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
outside of marriage
is prohibited by Jehovah.

01:18:32.648 --> 01:18:35.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 6:18 says:

01:18:35.943 --> 01:18:38.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Flee from sexual immorality!

01:18:38.529 --> 01:18:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Every other sin that a man may commit

01:18:41.323 --> 01:18:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is outside his body,

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:46.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but whoever practices sexual immorality

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:50.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

01:18:53.002 --> 01:18:55.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
When family members
follow Jehovah’s standards,

01:18:55.504 --> 01:18:58.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
the family is secure, stable, and happy.

01:18:58.924 --> 01:19:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video, note how a couple

01:19:02.178 --> 01:19:06.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefited from applying
God’s moral standards.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
We met at a party when I was in the military.

01:19:12.521 --> 01:19:16.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was on the dance floor, and I saw Frenchie.

01:19:16.776 --> 01:19:17.985 line:10% position:50% align:center
And I was like, ‘Oh!

01:19:17.985 --> 01:19:19.987 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m going to talk to this girl right here.’

01:19:21.947 --> 01:19:24.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole time we were just smiling
at each other

01:19:24.617 --> 01:19:26.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this instant attraction.

01:19:26.452 --> 01:19:28.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was mutual.

01:19:28.454 --> 01:19:31.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gradually, we were living together.

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:35.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a few months go by,

01:19:35.294 --> 01:19:37.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and things are going well,

01:19:37.296 --> 01:19:39.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I find out I’m pregnant.

01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:43.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he left.

01:19:44.762 --> 01:19:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was shocked

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:50.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
(though I shouldn’t have been),
but I was shocked.

01:19:50.893 --> 01:19:54.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And truthfully, I was scared,

01:19:54.397 --> 01:19:56.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
like, ‘What am I going to do now?’

01:19:56.983 --> 01:20:00.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like a failure,

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:02.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I kept asking myself,
‘How did I let this happen?’

01:20:06.826 --> 01:20:10.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that I had to be there,
and I wanted to be there.

01:20:10.663 --> 01:20:12.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t know how.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:17.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayed together for the first time
as a couple.

01:20:17.921 --> 01:20:21.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a Friday night.

01:20:21.174 --> 01:20:24.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saturday morning, we had a knock on the door.

01:20:24.177 --> 01:20:27.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided to have a Bible study.

01:20:27.347 --> 01:20:29.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had us study the chapter

01:20:29.349 --> 01:20:32.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
on family life and marriage.

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment,

01:20:34.437 --> 01:20:37.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that I wanted to have our relationship

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
be honorable before Jehovah.

01:20:41.444 --> 01:20:43.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
You learn that Jehovah

01:20:43.196 --> 01:20:46.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
meant for marriages to be a permanent bond.

01:20:46.283 --> 01:20:51.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
The insecurities of every disagreement

01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
ending in a breakup or a divorce

01:20:53.957 --> 01:20:56.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of that went away.

01:20:56.668 --> 01:21:00.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started to see Jehovah’s training

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
in practical ways,

01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:04.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
just learning

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:07.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to be a husband

01:21:07.387 --> 01:21:12.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
who respected and cared for his wife.

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:16.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
We became partners
—a team, a complement—

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was only because Jehovah

01:21:18.982 --> 01:21:22.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
taught us how to do it.

01:21:22.027 --> 01:21:24.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though it was difficult at the outset,

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:30.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
we made that decision
to dedicate our life to do Jehovah’s will,

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:32.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we got baptized together.

01:21:35.499 --> 01:21:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been married 25 years,

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the insecurities are gone.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
I focus on all the blessings that have come

01:21:44.758 --> 01:21:47.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
just from keeping Jehovah in our life,

01:21:47.678 --> 01:21:50.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s the best feeling in the world.

01:21:57.104 --> 01:21:59.690 line:10% position:50% align:center
You can go at it on your own,

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’ll never find the joy,

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:05.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll never find the peace,
you’ll never find the security

01:22:05.446 --> 01:22:08.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from doing it Jehovah’s way.

01:22:12.912 --> 01:22:15.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was only after coming to know Jehovah

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and having faith in his standards 

01:22:17.917 --> 01:22:20.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the couple came to have a stable

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:25.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enduring marriage of 25 years.

01:22:25.549 --> 01:22:27.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about us?

01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:32.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we strengthen our faith
in God’s moral standards?

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Contemplate the benefits

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
of obeying God’s moral standards

01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:41.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the consequences of disobeying them.

01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:44.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note two Bible principles.

01:22:44.819 --> 01:22:47.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 32:29 says:

01:22:47.822 --> 01:22:51.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Be] wise! . . .
Ponder over this . . .

01:22:51.409 --> 01:22:53.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about [the] outcome.”

01:22:53.578 --> 01:22:56.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, contemplate the benefits

01:22:56.789 --> 01:22:59.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
of obeying God’s moral standards.

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:03.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, the consequences of disobeying

01:23:03.796 --> 01:23:07.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s moral standards can be severe.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 6:8 says:

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:14.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Sow] with a view to his flesh

01:23:14.974 --> 01:23:19.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
[and] reap corruption from [the] flesh.”

01:23:21.356 --> 01:23:25.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world’s entertainment industry
often ignores this fact.

01:23:25.109 --> 01:23:28.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your faith in God’s standards will grow

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:32.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you experience
the benefits of living by them.

01:23:32.909 --> 01:23:36.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obeying God’s moral standards
protects us physically,

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:39.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:44.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s standards make us wise

01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:47.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we do not have to learn

01:23:47.841 --> 01:23:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
from painful experiences.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:

01:23:52.846 --> 01:23:55.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re driving, and you see a sign.

01:23:55.765 --> 01:23:59.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “School speed limit:

01:23:59.519 --> 01:24:02.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
15 miles an hour.”

01:24:02.355 --> 01:24:05.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you do not adhere
to that standard of law?

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:10.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose you are driving at 50 miles an hour.

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
You hit a child crossing the road.

01:24:13.283 --> 01:24:16.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
The consequence for not obeying the standard—

01:24:16.953 --> 01:24:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be
an extremely painful experience.

01:24:21.917 --> 01:24:26.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s standards protect us from the pain.

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:32.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s conclude by sharing
some verses from Psalm 19.

01:24:32.511 --> 01:24:34.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn there.

01:24:35.764 --> 01:24:38.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
This psalm is speaking
about Jehovah’s standards,

01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:41.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
his laws, and reminders.

01:24:41.937 --> 01:24:46.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will first read Psalm 19:7:

01:24:46.733 --> 01:24:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The law of Jehovah is perfect,

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“restoring strength.

01:24:52.573 --> 01:24:55.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

01:24:55.617 --> 01:24:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the inexperienced one wise.”

01:25:01.582 --> 01:25:06.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not need
to remain naive and inexperienced.

01:25:06.086 --> 01:25:08.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
We become wise.

01:25:08.172 --> 01:25:12.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now read with me verses 8 and 9:

01:25:12.301 --> 01:25:15.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The orders from Jehovah are righteous,

01:25:15.429 --> 01:25:18.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“causing the heart to rejoice;

01:25:18.223 --> 01:25:21.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the commandment of Jehovah is clean,

01:25:21.185 --> 01:25:23.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making the eyes shine.

01:25:23.979 --> 01:25:26.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fear of Jehovah is pure,

01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“lasting forever.

01:25:29.068 --> 01:25:31.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The judgments of Jehovah are true,

01:25:31.529 --> 01:25:34.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
altogether righteous.”

01:25:35.658 --> 01:25:39.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living by God’s standards
brings approval from Jehovah.

01:25:39.912 --> 01:25:42.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoy a clean conscience

01:25:42.248 --> 01:25:44.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a good relationship with him.

01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:48.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, verse 11 says:

01:25:48.754 --> 01:25:52.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By them your servant has been warned;

01:25:52.842 --> 01:25:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
in keeping them, there is a large reward.”

01:25:58.556 --> 01:26:02.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says “a large reward” awaits us.

01:26:02.685 --> 01:26:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have faith in God’s moral standards.

01:26:07.064 --> 01:26:10.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obey them and become wise.

01:26:10.818 --> 01:26:13.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will protect you physically, 

01:26:13.154 --> 01:26:16.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

01:26:16.532 --> 01:26:21.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will have a clean conscience
and Jehovah’s approval

01:26:21.537 --> 01:26:25.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and in the end, everlasting life.

01:26:28.044 --> 01:26:31.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body
will now present 

01:26:31.422 --> 01:26:34.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
the final talk of this symposium,

01:26:34.384 --> 01:26:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Love.”

01:26:45.937 --> 01:26:48.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people believe in God.

01:26:48.856 --> 01:26:50.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what sense?

01:26:50.859 --> 01:26:55.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
They believe that there must exist
a God, a Creator.

01:26:55.405 --> 01:26:58.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sheer logic causes them to believe this.

01:26:58.825 --> 01:27:00.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:27:00.535 --> 01:27:04.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of being aware
that there is creation.

01:27:04.497 --> 01:27:07.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the Creator would not exist,

01:27:07.333 --> 01:27:09.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
no creation would exist.

01:27:09.753 --> 01:27:10.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:27:10.754 --> 01:27:13.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because nothing comes from nothing.

01:27:15.383 --> 01:27:20.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is also why we know
that God has always existed.

01:27:20.388 --> 01:27:24.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there would have been a time
when he did not exist,

01:27:24.267 --> 01:27:26.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
then nothing would exist today.

01:27:28.271 --> 01:27:30.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that creation exists

01:27:30.899 --> 01:27:34.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
proves there must be a Creator.

01:27:34.945 --> 01:27:38.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also shows
that God exists from all eternity,

01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:41.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
although with our imperfect human mind

01:27:41.827 --> 01:27:44.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a hard time grasping this.

01:27:46.206 --> 01:27:49.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are the product of his creation.

01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:54.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it enough
to believe in him as the Creator

01:27:54.464 --> 01:27:58.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
because without a Creator
there could be no creation?

01:27:58.635 --> 01:27:59.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:28:00.512 --> 01:28:04.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it enough for a child to believe
he has a father

01:28:04.558 --> 01:28:07.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
because without a father he would not exist?

01:28:07.603 --> 01:28:09.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:12.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
A child should love his father;

01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:16.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
a father normally loves
and cares for his children.

01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Creator, our Father,

01:28:19.448 --> 01:28:22.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only cares about his creation,

01:28:22.242 --> 01:28:24.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also loves us

01:28:24.328 --> 01:28:27.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cares for us as individuals.

01:28:29.124 --> 01:28:31.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
He cares about you.

01:28:32.211 --> 01:28:35.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God loves you.

01:28:35.881 --> 01:28:38.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you love him?

01:28:38.258 --> 01:28:41.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a lover of God?

01:28:41.971 --> 01:28:44.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not automatic.

01:28:44.431 --> 01:28:49.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul says at 2 Timothy 3:4

01:28:49.061 --> 01:28:53.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
that most people
in this time of the end would be

01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:57.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“lovers of pleasures
rather than lovers of God.”

01:28:59.447 --> 01:29:02.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we may have
feelings of worthlessness,

01:29:02.908 --> 01:29:07.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such feelings could dampen
our zeal in serving Jehovah,

01:29:07.663 --> 01:29:10.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
could dampen our love,
or even could cause us

01:29:10.374 --> 01:29:13.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stop serving him.

01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:17.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we need to build up and deepen

01:29:17.089 --> 01:29:20.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love and trust in Jehovah.

01:29:22.178 --> 01:29:25.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves mankind.

01:29:25.181 --> 01:29:28.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
What evidence is there for that?

01:29:28.017 --> 01:29:31.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see Jehovah’s love in nature.

01:29:31.395 --> 01:29:35.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
He created numerous trees,
plants, and flowers

01:29:35.441 --> 01:29:37.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can enjoy them.

01:29:38.736 --> 01:29:43.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
He created for us not only things
that we need to keep living

01:29:43.616 --> 01:29:46.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
but things that impress our hearts

01:29:46.035 --> 01:29:49.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
with awe and love for God,

01:29:49.163 --> 01:29:52.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Giver of “every good gift.”

01:29:54.002 --> 01:29:57.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man is not able to create one single animal

01:29:57.005 --> 01:29:59.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even a fruit or flower.

01:30:00.508 --> 01:30:03.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things God created help us to live

01:30:03.595 --> 01:30:07.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy living for as long as we do.

01:30:07.849 --> 01:30:11.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah loves mankind so much

01:30:11.477 --> 01:30:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he gave his firstborn spirit Son,

01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:16.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom we came to know as Jesus Christ,

01:30:16.649 --> 01:30:21.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a ransom for the sins
of us imperfect humans

01:30:21.362 --> 01:30:23.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
(for those who love him)

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they may live and enjoy

01:30:26.576 --> 01:30:29.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s love forever.

01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:35.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the first humans
rebelled against Jehovah God,

01:30:35.126 --> 01:30:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew that there would be many others

01:30:38.755 --> 01:30:42.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would choose to serve him out of love.

01:30:42.926 --> 01:30:47.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to John chapter 6.

01:30:48.974 --> 01:30:52.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your listening in to this program is proof

01:30:52.269 --> 01:30:56.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only of your love
for Jehovah God and Jesus

01:30:56.231 --> 01:31:00.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also of their love

01:31:00.444 --> 01:31:03.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you as an individual.

01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:08.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 6:44, Jesus said:

01:31:10.329 --> 01:31:12.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No man can come to me

01:31:12.706 --> 01:31:16.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
unless the Father, who sent me, draws him.”

01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures show
that Jehovah has given humans free will.

01:31:24.927 --> 01:31:27.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone has a choice

01:31:27.387 --> 01:31:29.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to serving him.

01:31:29.973 --> 01:31:33.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
God gently draws to himself

01:31:33.018 --> 01:31:36.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who have a heart
that is “rightly disposed.”

01:31:38.315 --> 01:31:41.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does so through the Bible’s message

01:31:41.193 --> 01:31:44.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and through his holy spirit.

01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:47.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah draw us?

01:31:47.449 --> 01:31:50.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek verb rendered “draw”

01:31:50.285 --> 01:31:55.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
is used in reference
to hauling in a net of fishes.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:58.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah drag us against our will,

01:31:58.586 --> 01:32:00.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
forcing us to serve him?

01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:01.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:32:01.755 --> 01:32:04.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave us free will,

01:32:04.341 --> 01:32:07.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he does not force our heart open.

01:32:08.679 --> 01:32:11.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
One scholar puts it this way:

01:32:11.599 --> 01:32:16.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no handle on the outside
of the door of the human heart.

01:32:16.353 --> 01:32:18.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must be opened from within.”

01:32:20.816 --> 01:32:25.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah searches through the billions
of hearts in this world,

01:32:25.488 --> 01:32:29.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for individuals
who are inclined toward him.

01:32:31.661 --> 01:32:36.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he finds such a person,
he responds in a touching way.

01:32:36.415 --> 01:32:39.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you such a person?

01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:42.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust you are.

01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:45.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gently attracts, or tugs,

01:32:45.383 --> 01:32:50.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the hearts of ones
who are “rightly disposed.”

01:32:51.556 --> 01:32:53.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does so in two ways

01:32:53.975 --> 01:32:56.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
—through the Bible’s message of good news

01:32:56.853 --> 01:32:59.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
and through his holy spirit.

01:33:00.064 --> 01:33:04.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah sees a heart
that is responsive to Bible truth,

01:33:04.485 --> 01:33:07.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
he uses his spirit to help the individual

01:33:07.655 --> 01:33:11.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
to grasp and apply that truth in his life.

01:33:12.785 --> 01:33:14.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without divine help,

01:33:14.787 --> 01:33:18.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could never become
genuine followers of Jesus

01:33:18.166 --> 01:33:21.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and devoted worshippers of Jehovah.

01:33:22.253 --> 01:33:26.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah draws people because he sees
something good in their heart

01:33:26.049 --> 01:33:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cares about them as individuals.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:35.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does knowing that Jehovah cares
about his worshippers as individuals

01:33:35.183 --> 01:33:39.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
move you to want to open
that door of your heart

01:33:39.187 --> 01:33:42.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and open it wide?

01:33:42.065 --> 01:33:44.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

01:33:44.442 --> 01:33:47.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a brother named Carlos

01:33:47.487 --> 01:33:51.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
came to appreciate
that Jehovah is the loving Father

01:33:51.199 --> 01:33:53.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom he had always yearned for.

01:33:58.123 --> 01:34:01.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I went through difficult times
during my childhood,

01:34:02.961 --> 01:34:05.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was like my Father.

01:34:07.841 --> 01:34:09.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was my refuge.

01:34:13.096 --> 01:34:16.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first memory I have of my dad

01:34:16.266 --> 01:34:19.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when I went to visit him

01:34:19.227 --> 01:34:21.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the prison where he was being held.

01:34:27.194 --> 01:34:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Jehovah so many times
for my dad to come back home.

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:33.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,

01:34:33.659 --> 01:34:36.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mom said, “Dad’s coming home today.”

01:34:36.578 --> 01:34:39.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went to school,
and when I came back, he was there.

01:34:40.749 --> 01:34:44.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that he was finally back for good
and that it would be forever.

01:34:50.884 --> 01:34:54.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
But soon after that,
I heard my mom and my grandmother crying,

01:34:54.721 --> 01:34:58.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they started to explain
that my dad was back in prison.

01:35:01.854 --> 01:35:06.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
From then on, I felt hatred,
resentment, and anger toward my dad

01:35:06.066 --> 01:35:09.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also toward Jehovah.

01:35:14.116 --> 01:35:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to take drugs

01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:19.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to lead an immoral and violent lifestyle.

01:35:25.961 --> 01:35:29.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, a couple of sisters
gave me a magazine.

01:35:29.173 --> 01:35:31.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was looking through it,

01:35:31.133 --> 01:35:34.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw the experience about Dustin.

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:38.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began to think about the times

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
during my childhood

01:35:40.309 --> 01:35:42.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I would take refuge in Jehovah

01:35:42.144 --> 01:35:43.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would feel the same way Dustin did.

01:35:43.896 --> 01:35:45.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say: “Jehovah is there.

01:35:45.731 --> 01:35:47.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t abandoned me.”

01:35:48.734 --> 01:35:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dustin never doubted Jehovah’s love,

01:35:51.570 --> 01:35:53.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
right up until the day he died.

01:35:55.741 --> 01:35:59.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

01:35:59.662 --> 01:36:02.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked him to forgive me because,

01:36:02.748 --> 01:36:04.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
well,

01:36:04.917 --> 01:36:06.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
it wasn’t his fault.

01:36:09.505 --> 01:36:13.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
That night I poured out
all my feelings to Jehovah.

01:36:13.301 --> 01:36:17.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

01:36:23.853 --> 01:36:26.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt Jehovah’s love every step of the way.

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:30.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed it through the brothers
who didn’t judge me for what I had done.

01:36:39.244 --> 01:36:41.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t matter how many problems we have

01:36:41.579 --> 01:36:44.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
or how far we’ve drifted away from Jehovah.

01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:48.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
He never abandons us.

01:36:57.178 --> 01:37:01.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has lovingly helped
many brothers and sisters

01:37:01.141 --> 01:37:03.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his love for them.

01:37:03.476 --> 01:37:08.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can reassure you
that Jehovah will help you as well

01:37:08.481 --> 01:37:11.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah loves you too.

01:37:12.986 --> 01:37:17.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how Jehovah
demonstrated his love for Carlos?

01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:22.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through his worshippers,
Jehovah lovingly cared for this young man.

01:37:22.996 --> 01:37:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 119.

01:37:28.794 --> 01:37:31.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had not forgotten Carlos,

01:37:31.546 --> 01:37:34.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though he had strayed for a time.

01:37:34.549 --> 01:37:36.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds us of the words

01:37:36.843 --> 01:37:41.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 119:176:

01:37:42.349 --> 01:37:45.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have strayed like a lost sheep.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Search for your servant,

01:37:47.562 --> 01:37:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I have not forgotten your commandments.”

01:37:52.192 --> 01:37:56.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are indications that Psalm 119

01:37:56.196 --> 01:38:00.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have been written
by young Prince Hezekiah.

01:38:00.117 --> 01:38:03.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah poured out his heart to Jehovah,

01:38:03.245 --> 01:38:06.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah responded.

01:38:06.165 --> 01:38:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, please pour out
your hearts to Jehovah,

01:38:10.919 --> 01:38:15.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take note
of how he will answer your prayers.

01:38:16.633 --> 01:38:20.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3.

01:38:21.555 --> 01:38:24.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can and will

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
intervene positively in your life.

01:38:28.187 --> 01:38:32.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says at Ephesians 3:20:

01:38:33.692 --> 01:38:36.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now to the one who can,
according to his power

01:38:36.987 --> 01:38:38.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is operating in us,

01:38:38.989 --> 01:38:41.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do more than superabundantly

01:38:41.909 --> 01:38:45.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”

01:38:47.498 --> 01:38:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expression
“his power that is operating in us”

01:38:52.294 --> 01:38:57.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
—is this not something very encouraging
and faith-strengthening?

01:38:57.299 --> 01:39:00.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
His power is not just “operating in us”

01:39:00.594 --> 01:39:04.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
but “operating in us . . . superabundantly”

01:39:04.932 --> 01:39:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no, but “more than superabundantly,”

01:39:07.810 --> 01:39:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
beyond what we can envision or comprehend.

01:39:12.315 --> 01:39:14.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will draw close to you,”

01:39:14.859 --> 01:39:17.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
says James 4:8.

01:39:17.945 --> 01:39:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether he wrote Psalm 119 or not,

01:39:20.823 --> 01:39:25.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah strengthened
his faith in Jehovah and trusted him.

01:39:25.578 --> 01:39:29.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did so even though he was surrounded
by false worshippers

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may have been ridiculed
by members of the royal court.

01:39:35.213 --> 01:39:37.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah blessed Hezekiah.

01:39:37.715 --> 01:39:42.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you trust Jehovah,
he will bless you as well.

01:39:42.136 --> 01:39:44.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
With reliance on God,

01:39:44.389 --> 01:39:47.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
you too can endure trials

01:39:47.392 --> 01:39:49.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
as integrity-keepers.

01:39:50.728 --> 01:39:53.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apply Bible principles in your life,

01:39:53.147 --> 01:39:56.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how following Jehovah’s advice

01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:59.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
will always work out for your good.

01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:05.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strong faith in God’s love helps us
to see beyond our imperfections

01:40:05.743 --> 01:40:09.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the negative experiences
that we may have had in the past.

01:40:10.665 --> 01:40:13.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us

01:40:13.877 --> 01:40:17.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as a cherished part of his household.

01:40:17.422 --> 01:40:22.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are a family member of Jehovah’s family.

01:40:23.219 --> 01:40:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the encouragement we receive

01:40:25.722 --> 01:40:27.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 119

01:40:27.724 --> 01:40:32.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 32.

01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:36.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith in God’s love gives us the confidence

01:40:36.650 --> 01:40:39.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to keep going.

01:40:41.363 --> 01:40:46.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 119:32, it says:

01:40:49.704 --> 01:40:53.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will eagerly pursue
the way of your commandments

01:40:53.917 --> 01:40:57.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you make room for it in my heart.”

01:40:59.131 --> 01:41:04.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote says: “Or possibly,
‘you make my heart have the confidence.’”

01:41:04.761 --> 01:41:08.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will be able to endure any trial.

01:41:08.724 --> 01:41:11.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are there things that can separate us

01:41:11.226 --> 01:41:13.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s love toward us?

01:41:15.355 --> 01:41:20.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall what we are told
at Romans chapter 8?

01:41:20.068 --> 01:41:24.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing can separate us
from Jehovah’s love toward us.

01:41:25.824 --> 01:41:28.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read this together,

01:41:28.243 --> 01:41:31.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans chapter 8

01:41:31.163 --> 01:41:35.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 35 to 39:

01:41:40.047 --> 01:41:43.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

01:41:43.634 --> 01:41:47.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Will tribulation or distress or persecution

01:41:47.721 --> 01:41:50.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?

01:41:50.975 --> 01:41:52.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as it is written:

01:41:52.977 --> 01:41:56.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For your sake we are being put to death
all day long;

01:41:56.855 --> 01:42:01.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have been accounted
as sheep for slaughtering.’

01:42:01.151 --> 01:42:03.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the contrary, in all these things

01:42:03.779 --> 01:42:08.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are coming off completely victorious

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:11.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through the one who loved us.

01:42:11.370 --> 01:42:14.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I am convinced
that neither death nor life

01:42:14.039 --> 01:42:17.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor angels nor governments
nor things now here nor things to come

01:42:17.668 --> 01:42:21.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor powers nor height nor depth
nor any other creation

01:42:21.172 --> 01:42:25.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

01:42:25.051 --> 01:42:28.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

01:42:30.723 --> 01:42:35.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are things that can diminish
or kill our love for Jehovah,

01:42:35.394 --> 01:42:38.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we need to be careful.

01:42:39.899 --> 01:42:41.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium has reminded us

01:42:41.901 --> 01:42:44.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
of why we have faith in God’s existence,

01:42:44.987 --> 01:42:48.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
his Word, his moral standards,

01:42:48.658 --> 01:42:50.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his love.

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the world around us grows more hopeless,

01:42:53.996 --> 01:42:56.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are determined to become

01:42:56.624 --> 01:42:59.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
more and more powerful by faith!

01:43:01.546 --> 01:43:06.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
About Abraham, Romans 4:20 says:

01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:08.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he did not waver in a lack of faith;

01:43:11.431 --> 01:43:16.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he became powerful by his faith,
giving God glory.”

01:43:17.187 --> 01:43:21.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Jehovah has also given
promises to us.

01:43:21.941 --> 01:43:25.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as he progressively fulfills them,

01:43:25.195 --> 01:43:30.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become
more and more “powerful by [our] faith”

01:43:30.074 --> 01:43:33.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give glory to Jehovah God!

01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:39.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for highlighting our reasons for faith.

01:43:40.502 --> 01:43:42.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will now sing song number 37,

01:43:42.587 --> 01:43:47.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Serving Jehovah Whole-Souled.”

01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:50.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, that’s song number 37.
