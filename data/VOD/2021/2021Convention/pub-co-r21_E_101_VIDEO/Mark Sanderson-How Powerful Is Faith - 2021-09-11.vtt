Dear brothers and sisters:

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:08.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this 2021 “Powerful by Faith!”

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me begin by extending to all of you

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the warm Christian love and greetings
from the Governing Body

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the United States Bethel family.

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me assure you
that we continue to pray on your behalf.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Powerful by Faith!”

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what a motivating
and what an encouraging theme

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this convention!

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we going to learn?

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re going to concentrate

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on answering three questions
at this convention.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:47.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is, What is faith?

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second one is, What can faith do for us?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the third is, How can we build our faith?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s appropriate, since this is
the introduction to the convention,

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to spend some time

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about each one of those questions.

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s begin with that first question:

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is faith?

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers and sisters, we know

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:17.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faith is something that is produced
in us by God’s holy spirit.

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Galatians chapter 5 says

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faith is a part
of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we have God’s spirit,
we will have faith.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what exactly is faith?

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go in our Bibles.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see the definition the Bible gives

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 11:1.

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you read it with me?

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:1 says:

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:53.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the evident demonstration of realities

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not seen.”

00:01:55.427 --> 00:02:00.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice that the definition
of faith is given in two parts.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the first part?

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first, it says:
“Faith is the assured expectation

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is hoped for.”

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, faith is the conviction

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:18.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will have the things
that we hope for.

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we could illustrate it this way:

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it’s like the conviction we have
when we go to bed at night

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that the sun is going to rise
in the morning.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the conviction that the farmer has
when he sows his seed

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that those seeds are going to sprout
and they’re going to grow.

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith makes future things promised by God

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as real as if we already have them now.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that the person with faith

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
firmly believes that everything
that Jehovah says is true

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that all of the promises
that Jehovah has made

00:02:56.697 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to come to reality.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s the second part
of that definition?

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:07.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is “the evident demonstration

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of realities that are not seen.”

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:10.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe we could illustrate it
with something simple like this cell phone.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have a cell phone
and you have cell phone service,

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then wherever you may be on the earth,
I could call you right now.

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, there are no wires
attached to this phone.

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could that possibly work?

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, we know that this technology

00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relies on radio waves.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you and I can’t see radio waves,

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but every time we make a call
on our cell phones,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see the evidence,
or the “evident demonstration,”

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that radio waves are real,

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:54.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we cannot see them.

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:58.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we really have faith,

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it means that we can believe in something

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:05.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is verified by strong evidence,

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it is unseen.

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that means that faith
as described in the Bible

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not unquestioning; it is not irrational;

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:18.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is not foolish or gullible;

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not being quick to believe something

00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with little or no evidence.

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True faith comes

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:30.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a careful analysis and study

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s precious Word, the Bible.

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:37.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The accurate knowledge
that we gain from God’s Word

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:39.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to build our faith.

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:43.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s there in the Bible
that we learn about God,

00:04:43.387 --> 00:04:45.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn about his name,

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:49.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn about his promises
that have already come true,

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we learn about promises that he’s made

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—exciting promises for our future.

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:59.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But faith is also built and established
by something else.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:03.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s creation.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:05.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look up into the night sky

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:09.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see the exact order in the universe,

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how does it make us feel?

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when we look at the human brain
and its complexity

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the complexity of the human eye,

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:19.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to come to the conclusion

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there must be a Designer.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:25.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is strong evidence

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an intelligent Creator.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why is it so important that you and I

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:36.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grow in our faith and develop faith?

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:39.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible answers that question too.

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:43.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you look with me at Hebrews 11:6?

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:6, it says:

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:50.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, without faith it is impossible

00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:53.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[isn’t that interesting? it is impossible]

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:55.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to please God well,

00:05:55.209 --> 00:06:00.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God
must believe that he is

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he becomes the rewarder
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:06.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you see the point?

00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:10.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Without faith it is impossible
to please God.”

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So faith is essential

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we are going to please God
and have his blessing.

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:20.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve talked quite a bit
about what faith is,

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:23.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here are two things that faith is not.

00:06:23.987 --> 00:06:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is not simply believing
that God exists,

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:32.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Bible says
that even ‘the demons believe in God,

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:34.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they shudder.’

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:39.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involves coming to know Jehovah,
coming to trust him,

00:06:39.378 --> 00:06:43.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forming an unbreakable friendship with him,

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Jehovah is so real to us

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we sense his love

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:54.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sense his approval
in our day-to-day life.

00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:57.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the other thing that faith is not?

00:06:57.062 --> 00:07:00.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is not simply hoping for something.

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible uses the example of Abraham.

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:05.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Abraham had

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:09.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the demonstration of the things
that he hoped for;

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:12.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had evidence that God was real.

00:07:12.452 --> 00:07:14.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did that affect Abraham?

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:16.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the result?

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together this important scripture

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:23.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 4:20.

00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:27.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 4:20, it says:

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:30.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he [that is, Abraham]

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not waver in a lack of faith;

00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but [notice, what did he do?]

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:42.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he became powerful by his faith,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving God glory.”

00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:47.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Abraham was moved;

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:51.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was motivated; he was empowered.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He became powerful by his faith.”

00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:58.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how appropriately, then,

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:02.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Romans 4:20 has been chosen

00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:06.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme text for this convention.

00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:09.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in a moment, we are going to talk

00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the power of faith,

00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:16.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but before we do,
we have a wonderful treat now.

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:18.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give your attention
to a recorded message

00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:22.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our dear Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body,

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:27.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he explains to us
how important faith is for Christians today.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the “Powerful by Faith!”

00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:45.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:08:45.587 --> 00:08:47.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’ll certainly be happy

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:49.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you made the effort to attend

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:51.468 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all three days of this convention.

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “powerful by faith”

00:08:55.931 --> 00:08:58.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is drawn from the apostle Paul’s words

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:01.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 4:20.

00:09:01.603 --> 00:09:04.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did the Governing Body choose faith

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:08.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:09:08.068 --> 00:09:10.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we need strong faith

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal successfully with our present trials

00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:17.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with those we’ll face in the near future.

00:09:17.452 --> 00:09:21.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 17:20,

00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:24.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus assured his disciples:

00:09:25.252 --> 00:09:27.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith

00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:29.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the size of a mustard grain,

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:32.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will say to this mountain,

00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:36.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move,

00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:39.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, faith enables us

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do things we could never imagine
doing on our own.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:51.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Christians, faith is essential.

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:55.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:59.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 John 3:23, we read:

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:03.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, this is his commandment:

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:05.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have faith

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:08.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the name of his Son Jesus Christ

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:10.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and love one another,

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:13.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he gave us a commandment.”

00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:18.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 11:6 tells us:

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Without faith

00:10:20.682 --> 00:10:23.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

00:10:23.685 --> 00:10:26.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must believe that he is

00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:33.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:10:34.446 --> 00:10:37.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, to receive Jehovah’s blessing

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gain the reward of everlasting life,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to build and maintain faith.

00:10:46.374 --> 00:10:49.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 1:17,

00:10:49.586 --> 00:10:52.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quoting the prophet Habakkuk, Paul wrote:

00:10:53.423 --> 00:10:56.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous one will live

00:10:56.134 --> 00:10:58.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reason of faith.”

00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:02.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With these words, Paul emphasized

00:11:02.098 --> 00:11:06.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will reward
all who show real faith.

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:09.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on our faith in Jesus’ ransom,

00:11:09.147 --> 00:11:11.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah forgives our sins

00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grants us a righteous standing
with him even now.

00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:16.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during Armageddon,

00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:19.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will protect God’s people

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:22.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then give them the opportunity

00:11:22.327 --> 00:11:25.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live forever in Paradise.

00:11:25.205 --> 00:11:28.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we want for all of you.

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:30.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us here today

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:33.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already have a large measure of faith,

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:35.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as Paul wrote

00:11:35.048 --> 00:11:38.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 1:24:

00:11:39.344 --> 00:11:43.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is by your faith that you are standing.”

00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:46.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reports from around the globe

00:11:46.184 --> 00:11:48.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
testify to your genuine faith

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:52.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing
through you

00:11:52.732 --> 00:11:54.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your faith.

00:11:54.776 --> 00:11:57.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel as Paul expressed

00:11:57.404 --> 00:12:01.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Colossians 1:3, 4:

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We always thank God,

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:07.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:09.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when we pray for you,

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:16.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love you have for all the holy ones.”

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But constant pressure
from Satan and the demons,

00:12:20.927 --> 00:12:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the old world, and our own imperfections

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:30.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The purpose of this convention

00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:33.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strengthen that faith.

00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:36.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how to cultivate true faith,

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:39.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to exercise it in our daily lives,

00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:43.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to maintain it
during difficult times.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:49.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay close attention
to each part of the program.

00:12:49.664 --> 00:12:53.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As scriptures are read,
follow along in the Bible.

00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:56.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may God’s Word empower you

00:12:56.755 --> 00:13:01.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a man, woman, or child of faith!

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:06.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Jackson.

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:09.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s come back now
to the point we were discussing.

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:13.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the power of faith?

00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, to open this discussion,
let’s open our Bibles

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s go to Matthew chapter 17

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:23.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together verses 19 and 20.

00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:27.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Matthew 17:19, 20:

00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:32.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the disciples came to Jesus privately
and said:

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Why could we not expel it?’

00:13:35.585 --> 00:13:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:
‘Because of your little faith.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For truly I say to you,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:49.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will say to this mountain,

00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:52.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Move from here to there,”

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and it will move,

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:59.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.’”

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:00.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:04.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that faith is powerful.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“Nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:10.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as Peter

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:13.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of his faith
was able to get out of the boat

00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:15.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walk on the water,

00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:18.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith can enable us to do things

00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:20.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from a human perspective

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:24.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seem to be completely impossible.

00:14:24.384 --> 00:14:28.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider six different things.

00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:30.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first one:

00:14:30.598 --> 00:14:35.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith opens up the privilege
of being able to walk

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:39.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our wonderful, amazing God, Jehovah.

00:14:39.733 --> 00:14:41.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:45.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible says
that men of faith like Noah

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:47.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“walked with the true God.”

00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:50.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean when it says that?

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:55.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Noah followed
Jehovah’s commandments and instructions

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so carefully

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Noah loved Jehovah so much

00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:05.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was just as though Noah and Jehovah

00:15:05.675 --> 00:15:08.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were walking down the street together

00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:12.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the closest and most intimate of friends.

00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:17.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is something that faith
made possible for Noah.

00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:22.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But brothers and sisters, here’s
the really wonderful and amazing thing:

00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was true for Noah,

00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:29.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also true for you,
and it’s also true for me.

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:33.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can experience what seems impossible

00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:38.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be actually walking
with our heavenly Father day by day.

00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:41.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the power of faith.

00:15:41.127 --> 00:15:43.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at a second one:

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:48.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moves us to obey the commands of God

00:15:48.092 --> 00:15:50.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without hesitation.

00:15:50.428 --> 00:15:53.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as an example, we think of Abraham.

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:58.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s called in the scriptures
“the father of all those having faith.”

00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:01.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how is Abraham an example?

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was quick to obey Jehovah

00:16:04.692 --> 00:16:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when Jehovah asked him to do things

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were very difficult, like leaving Ur

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:14.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offering up his only son.

00:16:14.118 --> 00:16:18.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham was willing to obey
because of his faith.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, brothers, think

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:24.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—think about what this makes possible today.

00:16:25.213 --> 00:16:29.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who have been addicted
to drugs, to tobacco,

00:16:29.217 --> 00:16:33.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to alcohol, to gambling, to pornography;

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who have been living
immoral lifestyles of all sorts;

00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who have said they would
never be able to give up those habits

00:16:41.729 --> 00:16:44.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that they would never be able
to change their lifestyle—

00:16:44.774 --> 00:16:46.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened?

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:48.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they developed faith,

00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:52.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through their faith and through their desire
to please Jehovah,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they broke free from all of those things.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have seen people like that.

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have seen them.
I have seen them.

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that people like this

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have conquered all of these bad things

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:09.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their faith.

00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:13.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you are one of those people.

00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:15.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is the real power of faith

00:17:18.641 --> 00:17:22.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not something theoretical,
not something imagined,

00:17:22.228 --> 00:17:24.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in action.

00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:27.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People experience that power

00:17:27.442 --> 00:17:29.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own lives.

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:32.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to the third one:

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:35.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in the fulfillment
of Jehovah’s promises

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moves us to want to go out
and preach the good news of God’s Kingdom.

00:17:40.705 --> 00:17:43.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, let’s read
what the Scriptures say about this.

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:48.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 4:13,

00:17:49.422 --> 00:17:51.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says there:

00:17:51.424 --> 00:17:55.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now because we have the same spirit of faith

00:17:55.011 --> 00:17:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as that of which it is written:

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I exercised faith,

00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:01.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“therefore I spoke’;

00:18:01.976 --> 00:18:04.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we too exercise faith

00:18:04.604 --> 00:18:07.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and therefore we speak.”

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does it mean?

00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without faith, without exercising faith
in the promises of God,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never ever be able to do
the preaching work.

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, maybe when you were first studying
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:18:22.872 --> 00:18:27.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe you said something like this:
‘I’ll never go from door to door.

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:32.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll never see me walking down the street,
knocking on doors.’

00:18:32.173 --> 00:18:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:36.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you grew in your faith,

00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:39.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you wanted to share
the things that you were learning

00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:43.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you wanted to talk
about all the wonderful things

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:45.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you were hearing about Jehovah.

00:18:45.353 --> 00:18:48.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, faith helps us conquer our fears.

00:18:48.648 --> 00:18:50.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us overcome shyness.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us overcome indifference
in the territory.

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:57.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us overcome opposition

00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even government bans.

00:18:59.742 --> 00:19:02.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hitler, Stalin,

00:19:02.328 --> 00:19:05.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union, and even Russia today

00:19:05.623 --> 00:19:10.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of them have said that they
would crush Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:19:10.628 --> 00:19:14.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they would put an end
to our preaching.

00:19:14.674 --> 00:19:16.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:20.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters kept on preaching

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:23.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite whatever opposition came,

00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:25.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers today

00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are living
under similar circumstances under ban

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:30.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue preaching also.

00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not give up.

00:19:33.317 --> 00:19:34.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:37.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are they able to keep going?

00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:40.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the power of faith.

00:19:40.575 --> 00:19:43.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moves them to action

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to continue telling the good news,

00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:49.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what the circumstances may be.

00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go on to the fourth point:

00:19:52.962 --> 00:19:56.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our faith moves us to act in ways

00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:58.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that bring blessings to us.

00:19:58.885 --> 00:20:00.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about this:

00:20:00.887 --> 00:20:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people who saw and heard

00:20:03.639 --> 00:20:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the teaching of Jesus and his works

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:08.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put faith in him.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They believed that Jesus
was able to heal them,

00:20:12.482 --> 00:20:15.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so that faith led to blessings.

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in what way?

00:20:17.487 --> 00:20:21.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes when Jesus
healed individuals, what did he say?

00:20:21.908 --> 00:20:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Your faith has made you well.”

00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:27.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, if those people

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:30.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had not exercised faith in Jesus,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would not have come to him

00:20:32.668 --> 00:20:34.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would never have experienced

00:20:34.712 --> 00:20:37.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the healing that he gave them.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:44.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we are not looking
to be physically healed

00:20:44.347 --> 00:20:46.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through our faith in Jesus,

00:20:46.557 --> 00:20:50.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many of us have made major decisions

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—made major changes in our lives—

00:20:53.189 --> 00:20:56.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to become disciples of Christ.

00:20:56.192 --> 00:21:00.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we left promising careers;
perhaps we left fame;

00:21:00.822 --> 00:21:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps we gave up higher education,
or whatever it may be.

00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is the promise
that Jesus made to all of us

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:13.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have made these decisions
based on faith?

00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:18.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Mark 10:29, look what Jesus said:

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:22.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one has left house

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or brothers or sisters

00:21:25.429 --> 00:21:28.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or mother or father or children

00:21:28.641 --> 00:21:33.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or fields for my sake
and for the sake of the good news

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who will not get 100 times more

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“now in this period of time

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:45.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—houses, brothers, sisters,

00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:47.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“mothers, children, and fields,

00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:50.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with persecutions—

00:21:50.037 --> 00:21:53.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the coming system of things,
everlasting life.”

00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:57.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we’ve made these decisions.

00:21:57.837 --> 00:22:00.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have walked away
from many things in the world,

00:22:00.882 --> 00:22:04.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by putting faith in Christ Jesus,

00:22:04.051 --> 00:22:08.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what amazing blessings have come to us,
just like Jesus said

00:22:08.723 --> 00:22:13.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“100 times more”
than what we have given up!

00:22:13.144 --> 00:22:16.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the power of faith.

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:18.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at number five:

00:22:19.483 --> 00:22:22.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith helps us to win our struggle

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the superhuman spirit forces.

00:22:26.365 --> 00:22:28.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, how so?

00:22:28.492 --> 00:22:31.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Ephesians 6

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:36.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 16.

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:41.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ephesians 6:16,

00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Besides all of this,

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:48.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“take up the large shield of faith,

00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:51.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with which you will be able to extinguish

00:22:51.057 --> 00:22:55.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the wicked one’s burning arrows.”

00:22:55.102 --> 00:22:57.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what is the point?

00:22:57.563 --> 00:23:01.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that here
in Ephesians chapter 6,

00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:04.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith is compared to a “large shield”?

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a large shield
that covers most of the body,

00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith in Jehovah God
and his promises for the future

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can shield us from
—what does it say in verse 16?—

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the wicked one’s burning arrows.”

00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:25.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be completely protected.

00:23:25.466 --> 00:23:27.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:23:27.468 --> 00:23:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that through our faith,
we have the power

00:23:31.347 --> 00:23:34.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get up and turn off that television.

00:23:34.183 --> 00:23:38.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the power to walk out
of that movie theater.

00:23:38.562 --> 00:23:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the power to unplug
that computer, if necessary,

00:23:43.192 --> 00:23:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get rid of those temptations or bad ideas

00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could motivate us to enter
into a course of wrongdoing.

00:23:52.201 --> 00:23:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is no wonder that 1 Thessalonians 5:8

00:23:57.206 --> 00:24:00.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compares faith to a “breastplate”

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:03.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can protect our figurative heart

00:24:03.004 --> 00:24:06.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from temptation and from the power of sin.

00:24:06.674 --> 00:24:10.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is real power.

00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:12.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s go to our sixth point:

00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:16.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moves us to trust

00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:20.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our prayers to Jehovah God are heard

00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:22.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah will answer them

00:24:22.815 --> 00:24:25.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are in harmony with his will.

00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:27.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jesus said.

00:24:27.653 --> 00:24:29.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you read it with me?

00:24:29.113 --> 00:24:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Mark 11:24.

00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:38.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “This is why I tell you,

00:24:38.831 --> 00:24:42.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the things you pray and ask for,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have faith that you have received them,

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:48.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will have them.”

00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:52.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers, when we have that faith

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:55.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the things we are asking Jehovah,

00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:58.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s hearing us and he’s listening to us,

00:24:58.642 --> 00:25:02.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially during these troubled times
—in the midst of this pandemic—

00:25:02.396 --> 00:25:05.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we have many anxieties and concerns.

00:25:05.399 --> 00:25:08.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful that we can believe

00:25:08.235 --> 00:25:10.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God is hearing us

00:25:10.446 --> 00:25:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he is going to provide
an answer to us,

00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:18.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just exactly in harmony with what we need!

00:25:18.037 --> 00:25:20.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after considering

00:25:20.623 --> 00:25:23.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these six different factors,

00:25:23.542 --> 00:25:28.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t you agree with me
that faith is powerful?

00:25:28.172 --> 00:25:30.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has real power

00:25:30.216 --> 00:25:33.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make things that seem impossible to men

00:25:33.677 --> 00:25:38.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become realities for those
who have faith in Jehovah.

00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:44.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how thankful we can be
that Jehovah is helping us

00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:47.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop this wonderful quality

00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:49.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through solid evidence,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through accurate knowledge,

00:25:51.612 --> 00:25:55.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through his precious holy spirit!

00:25:55.574 --> 00:25:58.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that brings us to that third question:

00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:01.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we build up our faith?

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe more specifically,
How is this convention

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:07.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going to help us to build our faith?

00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:10.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the convention
is going to include many talks,

00:26:10.798 --> 00:26:13.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symposiums, interviews,

00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:15.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to have
a two-part Bible drama.

00:26:15.803 --> 00:26:19.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is much to look forward to.

00:26:19.223 --> 00:26:21.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe just for a few minutes,

00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:23.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you open up your program,
perhaps on your device

00:26:23.936 --> 00:26:26.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like I’m using here today?

00:26:26.021 --> 00:26:28.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s consider some of the highlights

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can expect to see in our convention.

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:35.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ll notice that on day one,

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the theme for the day is from Luke 17:5:

00:26:39.243 --> 00:26:42.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:46.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to strengthen
your relationship with Jehovah?

00:26:46.125 --> 00:26:49.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, pay attention
to the dramatic Bible reading.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where we’re going to learn
about how faith

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved Noah to be able to obey Jehovah,

00:26:56.427 --> 00:27:00.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though the things Jehovah
asked of him were very, very large.

00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:04.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take notice of that audio drama.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the afternoon—

00:27:06.812 --> 00:27:10.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a person
that loves Jehovah’s creation?

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the second symposium of our convention,

00:27:12.902 --> 00:27:16.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith,”

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:18.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to show us how Jehovah’s love,

00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:21.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wisdom, and his power

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are reflected in all the beautiful things
that he made.

00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to show us also

00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:30.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah not only has the ability
but the desire

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:33.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill his promises for the future.

00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:35.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then how about this?

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:38.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How strong is your faith?

00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:42.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, take notice of the final talk
on Friday afternoon.

00:27:42.097 --> 00:27:44.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where we’re going to hear the talk

00:27:44.183 --> 00:27:48.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Keep Testing Whether You Are in the Faith’
—How?”

00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll give us an opportunity
to look at our own faith

00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:54.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see just how strong it is.

00:27:54.693 --> 00:27:57.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to day two.

00:27:57.321 --> 00:28:01.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we see that the theme for the day
is going to be Jude 3:

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith.”

00:28:04.912 --> 00:28:08.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you begun to use
our new study publication,

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:10.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>?

00:28:10.709 --> 00:28:13.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll all want
to listen carefully to the talk

00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:17.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Build Faith Using <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>”

00:28:17.424 --> 00:28:21.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s going to discuss
how we can use this new study publication

00:28:21.637 --> 00:28:24.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the heart of our student

00:28:24.014 --> 00:28:28.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to help our student to build faith.

00:28:29.645 --> 00:28:31.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within Jehovah’s organization,

00:28:31.772 --> 00:28:36.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have many brothers and sisters
who have unbelieving mates,

00:28:36.026 --> 00:28:39.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have many who are part
of single-parent families,

00:28:39.613 --> 00:28:42.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have many who are single.

00:28:43.075 --> 00:28:45.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The symposium entitled

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:48.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith”

00:28:48.455 --> 00:28:51.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to show us what we can learn

00:28:51.333 --> 00:28:53.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these faithful Christians.

00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:55.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take note!

00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:57.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then looking in the afternoon,

00:28:57.756 --> 00:29:00.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although we can’t travel right now,

00:29:00.342 --> 00:29:04.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to have the opportunity
to go on an around-the-world tour

00:29:04.555 --> 00:29:07.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the video
<i>How Our Brothers Are Showing Faith in . . .</i>

00:29:07.725 --> 00:29:10.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to take us all around the world

00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:14.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show us how our brothers
are manifesting faith

00:29:14.148 --> 00:29:17.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in many, many different parts
of this beautiful earth.

00:29:17.693 --> 00:29:22.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you are all in for an amazing treat

00:29:22.573 --> 00:29:25.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Part I of the Bible drama

00:29:25.576 --> 00:29:28.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:29:28.287 --> 00:29:31.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I think I can say confidently

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is absolutely the best drama

00:29:35.252 --> 00:29:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have ever produced.

00:29:37.087 --> 00:29:39.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are going to love it!

00:29:39.757 --> 00:29:42.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the last talk on day two
is a serious one.

00:29:42.926 --> 00:29:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to contrast faith destroyers
with faith builders,

00:29:47.931 --> 00:29:51.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s going to show us
how we can strengthen our trust

00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:56.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s Word
and also in his organization.

00:29:56.148 --> 00:29:58.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, finally, on day three,

00:29:58.275 --> 00:30:01.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our theme is going to be Matthew 21:21:

00:30:01.862 --> 00:30:05.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:07.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to look at what we can learn

00:30:07.951 --> 00:30:11.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from faithful women of God.

00:30:11.038 --> 00:30:14.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice,
there is an eight-part symposium

00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:19.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that shows us how the women
featured in each talk showed faith

00:30:19.338 --> 00:30:23.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also how we can imitate their faith.

00:30:23.175 --> 00:30:26.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the afternoon,
we have the thrilling finale

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:31.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that Bible drama
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:30:31.392 --> 00:30:35.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, then, the convention
will conclude all too soon

00:30:35.896 --> 00:30:38.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the very motivating and moving talk

00:30:38.691 --> 00:30:42.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become Powerful by Your Faith!”

00:30:42.569 --> 00:30:44.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers, would you like to see

00:30:44.571 --> 00:30:46.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a taste of what’s in store

00:30:46.824 --> 00:30:48.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of the videos
we’re going to be seeing?

00:30:48.867 --> 00:30:50.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:55.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:30:55.582 --> 00:30:57.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:30:58.168 --> 00:31:02.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:31:04.007 --> 00:31:07.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:31:07.553 --> 00:31:09.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:31:12.224 --> 00:31:15.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:16.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But

00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:19.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:31:21.233 --> 00:31:23.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really want fear of man to stop me

00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:25.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from becoming Jesus’ disciple?

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if a veil had been lifted
from my eyes.

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:31.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my darkest times,

00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:40.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:42.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew these words

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would build my faith.

00:31:46.341 --> 00:31:48.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:50.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do what is good.”

00:31:53.557 --> 00:31:57.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, doesn’t that whet your appetite
for what is coming at this convention?

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:02.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep in mind that some of the videos
at the convention present real accounts,

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:05.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many others are just dramatizations.

00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:07.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
