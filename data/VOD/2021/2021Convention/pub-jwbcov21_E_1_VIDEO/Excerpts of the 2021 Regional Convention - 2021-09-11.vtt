I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

If a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:26.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really want fear of man to stop me

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from becoming Jesus’ disciple?

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if a veil had been lifted
from my eyes.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my darkest times,

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew these words

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would build my faith.

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do what is good.”
