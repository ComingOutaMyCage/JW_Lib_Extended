I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:06.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:11.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:17.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:25.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
But

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:29.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:34.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was as if a veil had been lifted
from my eyes.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the moment

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my darkest times,

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:45.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew these words

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
would build my faith.

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:00.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do what is good.”
