00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We warmly welcome all of you

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:08.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this month’s broadcast.

00:00:08.158 --> 00:00:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is just a taste

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:14.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we can look forward to on the program.

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A life spent in the full-time ministry

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:20.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is both exciting and challenging.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet a brother and his wife

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have spent decades 
in various forms of this service.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn from their experiences?

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we’ll hear the story of a woman

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:38.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who struggled for years 
with severe drug addiction.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would help her eventually break free?

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new music video

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:49.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us feel the brotherly love we enjoy

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:51.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a part of Jehovah’s organization.

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s certainly plenty to enjoy

00:00:55.905 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this August 2018 edition

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:25.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme for this month’s program is

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:29.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:34.177 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Who of us does not enjoy being given

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fine, well-chosen gift?

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you brothers,

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you not take pleasure in receiving

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a colorful but tasteful,

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
100 percent silk tie?

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, you sisters, 
do you not delight in being given

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:55.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an exquisite, charming silk scarf?

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you took that silk tie

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or silk scarf

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and used it to polish your shoes?

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think 
the giver of your gift would feel

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:12.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he saw you using his gift in that way?

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, it would be misuse

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:20.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and disrespect for the gift 
and would insult the giver.

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:24.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the point of our illustration?

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah and Jesus have given us

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fine, well-chosen gift 
in the form of the elders.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we will discuss,

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:38.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us must make sure

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:43.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we always show appreciation and respect

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this divine provision.

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Ephesians 4:8,

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read about this gift

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:59.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah and Jesus have given us.

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:01.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:03.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For it says:

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘When he ascended on high

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘he carried away captives;

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave gifts in men.’”

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:17.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice, by means 
of Jesus’ perfect integrity,

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus conquered Satan and his world.

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a world conqueror,

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:27.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
figuratively He has plundered captives

00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has given them 
as gifts to the congregations.

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How useful are these “gifts in men”?

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:40.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, please look 
at verses 11 and 12 for the answer:

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he gave some as apostles,

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some as prophets,

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some as evangelizers,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some as shepherds and teachers,

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:55.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with a view 
to the readjustment of the holy ones,

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for ministerial work,

00:03:57.287 --> 00:04:00.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build up the body of the Christ.”

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, they would be “evangelizers”

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—taking the lead

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:11.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the all-important preaching 
and disciple-making work.

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:13.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not simply say to the publishers,

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go in the preaching work.”

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say: “Come. 
Come with us.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:26.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s work together 
in this never-to-be-repeated work.”

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also “shepherds”

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:31.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—protecting the flock from Satan

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “murderer,” 
“serpent,” “dragon,” and “lion.”

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:38.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, they are “teachers”

00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:43.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feeding the flock 
with nourishing spiritual food.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah tell us

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should feel 
about these hardworking “gifts in men”?

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:55.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

00:04:55.812 --> 00:04:58.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s get the answer.

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

00:05:00.483 --> 00:05:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning in verse number 12,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what Jehovah says:

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now we request you, brothers,

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to show respect

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for those who are working hard among you

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and presiding over you in the Lord

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and admonishing you;

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to give them extraordinary consideration

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:28.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in love because of their work.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be peaceable with one another.”

00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, we’re told to “show respect”

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:39.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these dear brothers.

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s move to a vital question,

00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we show, demonstrate,

00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do deeply respect

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciate these dear brothers?

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first way:

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:59.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by wholeheartedly cooperating with them.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Hebrews 13:17,

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this scripture describes how deep

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:13.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our cooperation should be, verse 17:

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be obedient

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who are taking the lead among you

00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and be submissive,

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for they are keeping watch over you

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as those who will render an account,

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:32.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they may do this 
with joy and not with sighing,

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:36.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this would be damaging to you.”

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:41.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, we are told to “be obedient.”

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, this means 
that we’re supposed to comply with,

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or obey, what they tell us.

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, that would be with the proviso:

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:53.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless they tell us to do 
something that is unscriptural.

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, that would be extremely rare.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:01.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re also told to “be submissive.”

00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes the attitude

00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:06.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with which we’re to be obedient

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:11.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—doing so with a yielding, positive attitude.

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would it be possible to be obedient

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not submissive?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what if we said:

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“OK. I’ll do what the elders suggest.

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:29.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to do it, but I’ll do it.”

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:33.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would be obedient but not submissive.

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jehovah tells us

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to display both of these qualities.

00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should be obedient and submissive

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if what the elders are asking us to do

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:50.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not the best, 
most efficient way to do something.

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:53.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Permit me to illustrate this point.

00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Admittedly, the illustration 
is somewhat exaggerated,

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but hopefully it will make the point.

00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:05.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please imagine that the elders decide

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the outside of the Kingdom Hall

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs to be painted 
and that all the publishers

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be given 
a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush

00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with which to paint.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what could happen?

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:22.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers could get all upset

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:24.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning this request of the elders,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying, “It is ridiculous 
that the elders want us

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to paint 
with a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush!”

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:36.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consequently, some could start campaigning

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the right for everyone 
to use a six-inch (15 cm) paintbrush.

00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:46.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others might campaign for using paint rollers

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to roll the paint on the Kingdom Hall.

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still others 
might start trying to build support

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for renting and using a paint sprayer

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spray the paint on the Kingdom Hall.

00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:04.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In another camp, 
ones might champion the idea

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of hiring out to a contractor

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the painting of the Kingdom Hall,

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while another group is promoting the idea

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:17.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Kingdom Hall 
doesn’t even need to be painted.

00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:20.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what would be the outcome?

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation would be divided,

00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:26.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom Hall would never get painted,

00:09:26.349 --> 00:09:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publishers could end up 
stumbled right out of the truth,

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:33.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders would be very discouraged,

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:35.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would be sad,

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:40.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Satan would be made very happy.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:47.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what if everyone humbly supported 
the elders, perhaps thinking:

00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:49.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There’s no scripture

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that says we can’t paint 
with a two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:57.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘In fact, Hebrews 13:17 tells us

00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:01.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to “be obedient” 
and “submissive” to the elders.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why don’t we go ahead 
and support the elders?’

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:08.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what would be the outcome?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom Hall would get painted,

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publishers would get to enjoy

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of good association

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:20.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’d be working together 
for a long time,

00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:23.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders would be very encouraged,

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:26.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan would be sad,

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah’s heart would be made glad.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:36.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is the point 
of this hyperbole illustration?

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being obedient and submissive 
to those taking the lead

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is much more important 
than how something is done.

00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the attitude

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:50.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will richly bless.

00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:54.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, a second way we can demonstrate

00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:57.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we deeply appreciate these dear brothers

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to pray for them.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note what the elder Paul urged

00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers to do for him

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:10.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 15:30.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Paul said:

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:17.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I urge you, brothers,

00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through our Lord Jesus Christ

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through the love of the spirit,

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:26.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you exert yourselves with me

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:31.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in prayers to God for me.”

00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:34.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul recognized

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:36.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power that he would derive

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:40.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of others praying for him,

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your local elders feel the same way.

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:46.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:49.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your personal, private prayers,

00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:52.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you regularly thank Jehovah

00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:54.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your “gifts in men” and entreat Jehovah

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to richly supply them 
with his powerful holy spirit?

00:11:59.502 --> 00:12:04.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our answer to that question can reveal much

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:08.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our appreciation 
for these hardworking elders.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:12.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s move to a third way

00:12:12.782 --> 00:12:16.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can demonstrate deep appreciation:

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do so by commending the elders.

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:24.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a soul-searching question:

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you periodically go up

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to various elders and say something like,

00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brother Elder,

00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:35.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we just want 
to thank you for your hard work.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:39.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be assured that we appreciate it”?

00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:42.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, it seems

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:46.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some publishers 
never ever commend the elders

00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:49.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or express appreciation.

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might this not indicate 
that we are taking them

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their hard work for granted?

00:12:55.758 --> 00:12:59.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they will not quit 
if you do not give them commendation;

00:12:59.995 --> 00:13:03.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they primarily do their work for Jehovah.

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you do express appreciation,

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
believe me,
it will be most encouraging to them.

00:13:11.507 --> 00:13:15.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though 
it may really surprise the elder

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the very first time you do this,

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:19.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please do not hold back

00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:24.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this “good from those to whom it is owing.”

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appropriately,

00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells us at Proverbs 3:27:

00:13:30.826 --> 00:13:35.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not withhold good 
from those to whom you should give it

00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it is within your power to help.”

00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one thing 
that will move us to be more aware

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of commending the elders is to remember 
all the good work they are doing.

00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many elders are family men

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who must work secularly 
to provide for their families.

00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he has children,

00:13:57.953 --> 00:14:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these young ones need time 
and attention from their father.

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may need to help 
them with their schoolwork

00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as schedule time for them

00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy wholesome recreation.

00:14:11.734 --> 00:14:16.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most important, he cares 
for the spiritual needs of his family

00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:19.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—regularly conducting family worship,

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working with them in the ministry,

00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking them to meetings.

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:27.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in addition 
to these numerous responsibilities

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
common to many of us,

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:33.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have voluminous additional responsibilities

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:35.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as elders.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And much of the elders’ hard work

00:14:37.493 --> 00:14:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our behalf 
is not seen by the congregation.

00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:44.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may see

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an elder giving a part on the meeting.

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you didn’t see

00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:52.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the hours he spent preparing that part.

00:14:52.841 --> 00:14:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long does it take you

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:58.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare a student assignment

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the midweek meeting?

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:03.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some elders have a part every week,

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes more than one.

00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While gaining experience 
in speaking is certainly helpful,

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fact remains

00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:17.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that good talks require hard work.

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:20.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not all that the elders do.

00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:23.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have shepherding calls to make

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:26.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and judicial cases to handle.

00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:30.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some elders are also busy 
helping to build Kingdom Halls

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and branch facilities,

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving on Hospital Liaison Committees,

00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:38.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
volunteering at assemblies and conventions

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:41.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and elders do many other things

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are too numerous to recount.

00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:50.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we see 
is often only the tip of the iceberg

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—90 percent of an iceberg

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is unseen underwater.

00:15:56.672 --> 00:16:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Timothy 4:6,

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:03.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul referred to himself

00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:08.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “being poured out like a drink offering.”

00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A drink offering

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:14.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was poured on the altar 
and went up in smoke.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That well describes how the elders likewise

00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expend themselves.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering all of this should move us

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to regularly offer sincere commendation

00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:32.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our hardworking elders.

00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have discussed ways

00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can demonstrate

00:16:37.446 --> 00:16:42.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we deeply appreciate our “gifts in men.”

00:16:42.184 --> 00:16:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should 
(1) wholeheartedly cooperate with them,

00:16:48.223 --> 00:16:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) pray for them,

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:53.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) commend them.

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereby we will prove

00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:59.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are not even slightly like

00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:04.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an unappreciative recipient 
of a silk tie or a silk scarf,

00:17:04.206 --> 00:17:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who uses that gift to polish his shoes.

00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:10.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the contrary,

00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will prove to Jehovah and Jesus

00:17:13.716 --> 00:17:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we love, respect,

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciate

00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine gifts
—our “gifts in men”—

00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:26.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have so generously given to us!

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, what effect 
can these “gifts in men”

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:36.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have on individuals 
who have strayed from Jehovah

00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:39.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his organization?

00:17:39.374 --> 00:17:42.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What actions show 
that they are loving shepherds

00:17:42.878 --> 00:17:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to assist 
these ones to return to Jehovah

00:17:47.349 --> 00:17:51.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite serious struggles or even addictions?

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:57.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look for those answers 
in the following story.

00:17:58.527 --> 00:18:01.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Turn your life around,

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘so that seasons of refreshing

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:05.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may come from Jehovah himself.’

00:18:07.603 --> 00:18:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words changed my life,

00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they saved the life of my little girl.

00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:15.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised in a Witness family.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:23.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I chose

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a dark underworld

00:18:26.755 --> 00:18:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of practically everything
that Jehovah hates.

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:33.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After about 15 years,

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although financially secure,

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was confronted with the failure
that my life had become.

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:49.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was trying to raise a child
while addicted to drugs.

00:18:51.413 --> 00:18:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t want
to live like that anymore,

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:57.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted to be a good mother.

00:18:57.853 --> 00:19:00.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the first time in years,

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:04.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:19:04.293 --> 00:19:08.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The knock came on my door
the very next day.

00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:15.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began studying with a vengeance.

00:19:17.472 --> 00:19:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had 15 years to catch up on.

00:19:21.844 --> 00:19:24.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a lot of help.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I progressively changed my lifestyle,

00:19:27.883 --> 00:19:30.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I changed my associates,

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I conquered my addiction.

00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:35.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I slowly began to overcome

00:19:35.324 --> 00:19:38.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feelings of worthlessness.

00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:42.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So none of these changes were easy to make,

00:19:42.364 --> 00:19:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it made me feel

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:45.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clean and happy

00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that Jehovah was pleased.

00:19:48.837 --> 00:19:51.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My burning desire at that point 
really was to begin sharing

00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:54.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with other people what I was learning,

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:58.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I didn’t qualify
to engage in the public ministry

00:19:58.647 --> 00:20:02.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was still living
with my boyfriend at the time.

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:05.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he didn’t understand
some of the changes I was making.

00:20:05.754 --> 00:20:07.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was determined

00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:11.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to turn my life around
and overcome this last hurdle

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:13.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was preventing me
from serving Jehovah fully.

00:20:17.699 --> 00:20:19.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two weeks later,

00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:22.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found out I was pregnant.

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:25.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was devastated.

00:20:25.007 --> 00:20:29.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what all those people
who had helped me would think

00:20:29.411 --> 00:20:33.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah
felt about what was happening.

00:20:35.684 --> 00:20:38.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so ashamed.

00:20:38.553 --> 00:20:42.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually blamed Jehovah
for letting it happen.

00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so confused.

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:47.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My first inclination

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:50.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was just to get an abortion.

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:54.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But deep down,
I knew that was wrong.

00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘Now everyone will know

00:20:57.072 --> 00:20:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I’m still the worthless person

00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I always knew I was.’

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that point,
I just felt like giving up.

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:10.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told my aunt and uncle,

00:21:10.585 --> 00:21:14.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are Jehovah’s Witnesses,
about my situation.

00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:16.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t judge me at all,

00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:19.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they did offer a curious suggestion:

00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:23.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They invited me up to Bethel for a visit.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They introduced me to an elder
who was very kind,

00:21:26.768 --> 00:21:29.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I talked to him
about my situation.

00:21:29.972 --> 00:21:31.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked

00:21:31.974 --> 00:21:34.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by how loving he was.

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:38.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he shared with me Acts 3:19.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Repent, therefore, and turn around

00:21:42.684 --> 00:21:45.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so as to get your sins blotted out,

00:21:45.187 --> 00:21:47.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that seasons of refreshing

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may come from the person of Jehovah.”

00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:53.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he told me

00:21:53.495 --> 00:21:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had already sinned,
but why should I sin a second time?

00:21:57.466 --> 00:21:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should this innocent child pay

00:21:59.668 --> 00:22:01.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what I had done wrong?

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He suggested I teach my baby

00:22:04.773 --> 00:22:07.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah and raise the child up

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:11.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know Him and have a friendship with Him.

00:22:11.613 --> 00:22:14.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I loved that he took something that was

00:22:15.484 --> 00:22:18.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sad and depressing for me

00:22:18.553 --> 00:22:20.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turned it into something beautiful.

00:22:20.822 --> 00:22:22.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I had a new plan now.

00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:25.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really determined
to do everything I had to do

00:22:25.627 --> 00:22:28.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to turn my life around
in order to please Jehovah.

00:22:28.797 --> 00:22:32.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So eventually I qualified to become
an unbaptized publisher,

00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:36.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later I was baptized in 2010.

00:22:36.872 --> 00:22:39.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

00:22:40.308 --> 00:22:43.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I already dedicated my life to Jehovah.

00:22:43.678 --> 00:22:47.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So two of my goals 
are to get baptized and pioneer.

00:22:47.716 --> 00:22:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m as determined as ever
to raise Jolie up to love Jehovah

00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:55.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to avoid the traps
that almost cost us our lives.

00:23:01.396 --> 00:23:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Describing our elders,

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:08.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 32:2 reads:

00:23:08.503 --> 00:23:13.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And each one will be like 
a hiding place from the wind,

00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:18.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a place of concealment from the rainstorm,

00:23:18.113 --> 00:23:22.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“like streams of water in a waterless land,

00:23:22.284 --> 00:23:26.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“like the shadow of a massive crag

00:23:26.688 --> 00:23:28.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a parched land.”

00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:34.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note two key ways 
our “gifts in men” did that?

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, the elder she met at Bethel

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:42.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was kind and approachable.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made her feel 
comfortable to express herself.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:51.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two, he lovingly used the Bible

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:55.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her make a wise decision 
and avoid further calamity.

00:23:56.718 --> 00:23:59.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an excellent example

00:23:59.921 --> 00:24:04.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how elders can help ones 
who are struggling spiritually.

00:24:06.461 --> 00:24:11.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in what other ways 
can elders be an example?

00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their zeal for the ministry.

00:24:14.803 --> 00:24:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if weather conditions 
in our territory make this difficult?

00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:22.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the elders take the lead,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:27.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rest of the congregation 
responds in the same way.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The example of those preaching 
in the Faroe Islands

00:24:32.254 --> 00:24:36.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will offer some encouraging tips.

00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:51.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Faroe Islands are 
also called the Land of Maybe.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The weather is very diverse
and can rapidly change.

00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:00.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you begin in the ministry,
the weather can be sunny.

00:25:00.815 --> 00:25:03.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then ten minutes later,
you find yourself

00:25:03.285 --> 00:25:06.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a massive rain shower
and everything gets wet.

00:25:07.122 --> 00:25:09.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wind is another challenge.

00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:11.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have some severe winter storms.

00:25:11.226 --> 00:25:15.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have to be careful
that your service partner or the car door

00:25:15.564 --> 00:25:19.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t blow away
while you’re getting out of the car.

00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:24.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We make sure to wear clothes
appropriate for the weather.

00:25:25.473 --> 00:25:29.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also to stay updated
on the weather situation

00:25:29.411 --> 00:25:33.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see where in our territory
the weather is most suitable, and then adapt.

00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:38.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the weather is nice,
then we try to go from house to house.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the weather is bad,

00:25:40.522 --> 00:25:42.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you can go on calls
where you can go inside,

00:25:42.824 --> 00:25:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning where they will invite you in

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or where the entrance is covered.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can plan your ministry
so that if the weather gets bad,

00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:54.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can make visits that you know
will be at home that time of day.

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:59.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the weather is poor,
it’s good to adjust.

00:25:59.574 --> 00:26:03.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can do
some telephone witnessing or letter writing.

00:26:03.378 --> 00:26:05.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a meeting for pioneers,

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an elder reminded us
that when the weather is bad,

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:11.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try not to think:
‘The weather is bad again,’

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:16.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead,
‘Yay! Now people are actually at home.’

00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:20.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a good idea to have a plan
for whom you’d like to visit

00:26:20.295 --> 00:26:22.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you’d like
to talk to them about

00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:25.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because then when it rains
or the weather isn’t ideal,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you focus on your plan

00:26:27.535 --> 00:26:30.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of thinking
that now I have been out preaching

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:33.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for five hours in stormy weather.

00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think Ecclesiastes 11:4
applies quite well to our territory:

00:26:38.113 --> 00:26:42.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who watches the wind
will not sow seed,

00:26:42.117 --> 00:26:45.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one who looks at the clouds
will not reap.”

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have to wait
for the perfect weather conditions to preach,

00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:52.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we wouldn’t be out that often.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something else
that helps us to endure bad weather

00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:58.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to think of the first publishers
in the Faroe Islands.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fought with seasickness, bad weather,

00:27:01.303 --> 00:27:04.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had to hike over the mountains 
to visit remote settlements.

00:27:04.939 --> 00:27:07.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They overcame these obstacles,

00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:11.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it motivates me to overcome
the challenges I am facing today.

00:27:11.946 --> 00:27:14.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when we came
to the Faroe Islands,

00:27:14.582 --> 00:27:17.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I looked out the window 
and thought,‘Is it even possible

00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:20.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go out in the ministry
in this kind of weather?’

00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:23.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we arrived
at the meeting for field service,

00:27:23.358 --> 00:27:26.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the friends
with children and strollers were there

00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:28.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were positive
and ready for field service.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me think
that if they can do it, then I can too.

00:27:34.703 --> 00:27:39.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we are a team of publishers,
and we have the weather as our challenge.

00:27:39.107 --> 00:27:43.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And especially when the weather is bad,
we encourage one another.

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:49.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really like the song
“The Life of a Pioneer.”

00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:51.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an amazing song.

00:27:51.453 --> 00:27:55.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “In the work we endure,
whether sunshine or rain.”

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because we love Jehovah.

00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:02.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really want people
to get to know Jehovah.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to know the truth.

00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:07.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus said that we should preach,

00:28:07.802 --> 00:28:10.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that he 
also would have put on a raincoat

00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gone out to preach the good news.

00:28:13.842 --> 00:28:18.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We experience how Jehovah blesses
our efforts when we go in the ministry.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you especially feel it
when you persist in your efforts

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:23.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach when the weather isn’t good.

00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:27.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that one day
you have a really nice conversation

00:28:27.222 --> 00:28:29.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a person about the Bible.

00:28:29.657 --> 00:28:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also feel it gives me great joy.

00:28:32.227 --> 00:28:35.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said that the one who “sows bountifully
will also reap bountifully.”

00:28:36.664 --> 00:28:40.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you want to sow bountifully 
in the Faroe Islands,

00:28:40.235 --> 00:28:42.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to preach
also when the weather is bad.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we feel
that we have reaped bountifully

00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:47.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with nice return visits and Bible studies.

00:28:47.742 --> 00:28:49.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel it’s worth all the effort

00:28:49.911 --> 00:28:52.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we see that people in the territory

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really appreciate what they are learning.

00:28:54.682 --> 00:28:56.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All that we do in our ministry

00:28:56.451 --> 00:29:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is motivated by love for Jehovah

00:29:00.088 --> 00:29:04.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the people in the territory,
and it won’t be changed by bad weather.

00:29:04.492 --> 00:29:08.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an opportunity to show
that our worship is wholehearted.

00:29:08.863 --> 00:29:11.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t just go
in the ministry when everything is good

00:29:11.399 --> 00:29:13.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sun is shining.

00:29:15.069 --> 00:29:17.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we have become more enduring

00:29:17.705 --> 00:29:20.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and flexible in our ministry.

00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:27.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that the publishers 
were fully supporting

00:29:27.949 --> 00:29:30.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spirit that the elders showed

00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:32.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sharing the good news

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite inclement weather.

00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:38.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the world,

00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:42.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of our brothers face severe opposition

00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:46.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of remaining loyal to Jehovah

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:50.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintaining their Christian neutrality.

00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s travel to Spain

00:29:52.907 --> 00:29:55.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear how some of our brothers

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have dealt with these challenges firsthand.

00:30:01.649 --> 00:30:05.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spain is a land of castles.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the mountains of central Spain

00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:12.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Mediterranean coast, 
castles dominate the landscape.

00:30:13.628 --> 00:30:18.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is one castle
—the Castle of Santa Catalina—

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:22.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that played a unique part in the history
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Spain.

00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:27.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This castle that guards the entrance

00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:29.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the harbor of Cádiz,
in southern Spain,

00:30:29.944 --> 00:30:33.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became a military prison
over two centuries ago.

00:30:33.848 --> 00:30:35.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this fortress

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tested the faith
of around 300 Spanish Witnesses.

00:30:41.856 --> 00:30:46.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The battle began
in the 1960’s when Spain was ruled

00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by General Franco, a military dictator.

00:30:49.797 --> 00:30:54.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Franco wanted all Spanish men
to serve the fatherland,

00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this meant military service.

00:30:58.406 --> 00:31:01.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in Spain, there were Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:31:01.543 --> 00:31:03.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose conscience said no.

00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:06.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this castle became a battleground

00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:09.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Franco’s military regime fought

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stamp out the Christian consciences 
of those young Witnesses.

00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:20.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But times have changed in Spain.

00:31:20.361 --> 00:31:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city of Cádiz has organized an exhibition

00:31:22.997 --> 00:31:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to salute the sacrifice made
by those valiant Witnesses.

00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:31.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 40 years after their release,

00:31:31.739 --> 00:31:35.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of those conscientious objectors
have returned to Cádiz

00:31:35.343 --> 00:31:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend this exhibition.

00:31:39.013 --> 00:31:41.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the inauguration,

00:31:41.049 --> 00:31:44.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mayor described them
as citizens who spoke up

00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:47.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who presented arguments
against the injustice

00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:50.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—arguments based on peace, freedom,

00:31:50.892 --> 00:31:54.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, above all, their conscience.

00:31:54.562 --> 00:31:57.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who spent years
of their lives behind bars

00:31:57.865 --> 00:31:59.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have vivid memories

00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:02.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the times
when this castle was their prison.

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:07.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think one of the greatest challenges

00:32:07.976 --> 00:32:09.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was never knowing

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.281 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
if we would be granted our freedom.

00:32:13.281 --> 00:32:15.617 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our first sentence

00:32:15.617 --> 00:32:17.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for three years.

00:32:17.652 --> 00:32:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since we still refused
to enlist in the military,

00:32:21.055 --> 00:32:24.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were then sentenced again
for another lengthy period.

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:28.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it seemed as if we had a life sentence.

00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:31.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We organized daily activities

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:34.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep us busy.

00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:38.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mornings, we worked at our trades

00:32:38.473 --> 00:32:40.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to earn a little money.

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:45.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afternoons, we set aside
for spiritual activities.

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:49.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our preaching
was done mainly by writing letters.

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:55.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this way,
some of us could even pioneer.

00:32:55.423 --> 00:32:58.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few people did reply to our letters,

00:32:58.593 --> 00:33:03.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were thrilled to hear
that some of them accepted the truth.

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:08.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
we also preached to other prisoners,

00:33:08.002 --> 00:33:11.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few of them
became baptized Witnesses.

00:33:12.073 --> 00:33:14.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also studied the Bible thoroughly,

00:33:14.442 --> 00:33:16.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both individually and as a group,

00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:21.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which proved vital
in building us up spiritually.

00:33:21.616 --> 00:33:24.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first,
we had to study our literature secretly,

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:27.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but later the guards

00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:30.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowed us to have
the Bible and other publications.

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our numbers grew,

00:33:33.361 --> 00:33:36.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the Witnesses 
were kept together

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the same place
—in the same barracks—

00:33:38.866 --> 00:33:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could organize meetings.

00:33:43.304 --> 00:33:46.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even held assemblies,
including the Biblical dramas.

00:33:48.876 --> 00:33:50.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we loved

00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:53.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
singing Kingdom songs.

00:33:53.181 --> 00:33:57.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These songs really
lifted up our spirits.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really felt Jehovah’s loving care
when the brothers came to visit us.

00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:08.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even had a special visit
from Brother Grant Suiter

00:34:08.396 --> 00:34:10.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body,

00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:17.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there were also other visits
that we really looked forward to.

00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:21.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the brothers endured
years of separation from their families

00:34:21.743 --> 00:34:23.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fiancées.

00:34:23.745 --> 00:34:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a real test.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these faithful sisters

00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:31.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wholeheartedly supported their neutral stand.

00:34:31.853 --> 00:34:35.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those were years that molded me spiritually.

00:34:35.256 --> 00:34:39.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I studied the Bible
as I had never done before.

00:34:39.527 --> 00:34:44.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I developed skills
as a public speaker and as an overseer.

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:47.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Above all, it was a time in my life

00:34:47.602 --> 00:34:50.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I learned to rely totally on Jehovah.

00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:56.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to my fervent prayers,
he became my closest friend

00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:59.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he never let me down.

00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:02.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was priceless.

00:35:02.216 --> 00:35:05.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The firm stand of those Witnesses

00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:09.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave a powerful testimony
in Cádiz and throughout Spain.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The run-down military prison

00:35:12.226 --> 00:35:14.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that once tested their faith

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:16.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been restored.

00:35:16.264 --> 00:35:18.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is now a tourist attraction

00:35:18.299 --> 00:35:20.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a cultural center.

00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:23.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But while the castle has changed,

00:35:23.971 --> 00:35:28.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith of those valiant Witnesses has not.

00:35:28.242 --> 00:35:30.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The castle certainly tested them,

00:35:30.945 --> 00:35:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they fought a fine fight for the faith.

00:35:34.448 --> 00:35:38.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with Jehovah’s help, they won the battle.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty years later,

00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:43.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their victory is still giving a witness

00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:46.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s name.

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:51.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we noted earlier,

00:35:51.933 --> 00:35:54.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul said

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:58.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was “being poured out 
like a drink offering.”

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:03.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, by remaining neutral,

00:36:03.678 --> 00:36:06.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these brothers offered up a great sacrifice

00:36:06.113 --> 00:36:10.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of praise to Jehovah despite resistance.

00:36:10.685 --> 00:36:15.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we learned, by loyal endurance,

00:36:15.022 --> 00:36:17.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went on to be “gifts in men”

00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:22.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those in the congregations 
and circuits that they later served.

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:27.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other examples of “gifts in men”

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:31.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are those who serve 
as headquarters representatives

00:36:31.539 --> 00:36:34.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visiting branch offices

00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:38.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouraging members 
of the Bethel families.

00:36:38.646 --> 00:36:42.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Daniel Molchan had the privilege

00:36:42.316 --> 00:36:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit the countries of Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic.

00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have had 
some exciting spiritual developments

00:36:51.259 --> 00:36:54.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in those lands.

00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Sunday, February the 26th,

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I traveled 
to Port-au-Prince for the branch visit

00:37:01.235 --> 00:37:05.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was warmly welcomed 
by many of the Bethel family of 54 members.

00:37:06.707 --> 00:37:09.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch office 
supervises the preaching work

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:13.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than 20,000 publishers.

00:37:13.114 --> 00:37:15.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Haiti has faced economic challenges

00:37:15.283 --> 00:37:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suffered recent natural disasters,

00:37:17.885 --> 00:37:20.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers are positive

00:37:20.288 --> 00:37:25.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus their attention on helping 
others to identify our Scriptural hope.

00:37:25.259 --> 00:37:29.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Haitian people show 
a keen interest in the Word of God.

00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:34.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers average 
more than 42,000 Bible studies each month,

00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:36.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Haiti enjoyed a Memorial attendance

00:37:36.304 --> 00:37:39.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of more than 86,000 in 2016.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was four times more than the number 
of publishers in the branch territory.

00:37:44.712 --> 00:37:49.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers love to use 
the videos in the ministry.

00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is made possible 
by the Haiti audio/video team

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:55.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translating the videos 
into their native language.

00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:57.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While many in Haiti speak French,

00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:01.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the common language 
of the people in general is Haitian Creole.

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:03.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Creole is said to be

00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:06.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an expressive language 
that combines French words

00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the grammar 
of West African languages.

00:38:09.603 --> 00:38:13.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number of publishers in Haiti 
has quadrupled since the start

00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:17.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Creole translation back in 1987.

00:38:17.445 --> 00:38:20.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The complete New World Translation Bible

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:23.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was released in Creole in 2015.

00:38:23.284 --> 00:38:27.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met with the translation team 
to commend them for the good work they do.

00:38:27.688 --> 00:38:30.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reminded them of the many positive results

00:38:30.424 --> 00:38:32.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the field ministry that have taken place

00:38:32.526 --> 00:38:36.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since translating the Bible 
and our literature into Creole.

00:38:36.697 --> 00:38:41.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example, Mirlène is a vendor 
of fruits and vegetables who was asked

00:38:41.535 --> 00:38:44.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she would supply 
some of her produce to Bethel.

00:38:44.205 --> 00:38:46.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although she was very impressed

00:38:46.207 --> 00:38:49.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first time 
she arrived at the Bethel property,

00:38:49.076 --> 00:38:52.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she said she found 
the large steel gate to be intimidating.

00:38:54.148 --> 00:38:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she prayed to God to protect her

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while in the yard at Bethel.

00:38:58.152 --> 00:39:00.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers dealt kindly 
with her when she made

00:39:00.287 --> 00:39:02.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her deliveries on Monday each week.

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:05.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the brothers from the kitchen 
told her that maybe someday

00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:08.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she too would become 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:39:08.295 --> 00:39:11.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She accepted an invitation to the Memorial,

00:39:11.065 --> 00:39:14.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and despite some personal challenges, 
such as not being able to read well,

00:39:14.835 --> 00:39:17.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she began to attend 
some congregation meetings.

00:39:17.738 --> 00:39:20.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mirlène could see the difference

00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:23.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah’s loving people 
and those in her church.

00:39:23.077 --> 00:39:25.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A study was started with her,

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:28.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she progressed 
to the point of baptism in 2009.

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then, she has worked diligently

00:39:31.185 --> 00:39:34.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach the truth 
to her children with good results.

00:39:34.255 --> 00:39:39.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her oldest son graduated 
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:39:39.093 --> 00:39:42.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serves as an elder 
and temporary special pioneer.

00:39:42.696 --> 00:39:47.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, another of her sons 
was appointed a ministerial servant,

00:39:47.768 --> 00:39:52.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the four other children 
are unbaptized publishers.

00:39:52.006 --> 00:39:54.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having our literature in Creole

00:39:54.108 --> 00:39:57.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the help of her children, 
she has improved her reading.

00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:01.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She now benefits 
from reading the Bible in Creole,

00:40:01.348 --> 00:40:03.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the language of her heart.

00:40:04.985 --> 00:40:07.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good results are beginning to be seen

00:40:07.054 --> 00:40:10.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the field of American Sign Language, 
which is now used in Haiti.

00:40:10.724 --> 00:40:14.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are now 87 deaf publishers

00:40:14.028 --> 00:40:17.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 4 ASL congregations and 8 groups.

00:40:17.631 --> 00:40:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation here 
is singing praises to Jehovah.

00:40:22.603 --> 00:40:25.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even our little sister 
is learning to do this.

00:40:28.442 --> 00:40:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brother showed us 
the effort he puts forth

00:40:31.312 --> 00:40:34.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for a Bible reading.

00:40:34.415 --> 00:40:37.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A special program for Haiti was held

00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:39.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Saturday morning 
at the open-air Assembly Hall

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the branch property.

00:40:41.655 --> 00:40:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A total of 1,405 were in attendance.

00:40:45.259 --> 00:40:47.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very encouraged to see

00:40:47.394 --> 00:40:49.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the group of our brothers 
who benefited from the program

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in American Sign Language.

00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:56.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program was recorded and presented 
at Kingdom Halls throughout the country

00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:59.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
later that same day and also on Sunday

00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:03.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a combined audience of 34,812.

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:07.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt a little sad to leave 
the brothers on Sunday morning

00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:09.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a drive of about six hours or so

00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:11.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Dominican Republic

00:41:11.652 --> 00:41:15.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the second branch visit.

00:41:15.156 --> 00:41:18.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
En route, we traveled 
through some semiarid areas

00:41:18.759 --> 00:41:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the border between the two countries.

00:41:21.295 --> 00:41:24.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The terrain varied greatly 
as we drove through small mountains,

00:41:24.698 --> 00:41:29.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rich agricultural regions, 
and along the Caribbean Sea.

00:41:29.537 --> 00:41:33.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We took the opportunity 
to witness to some individuals at the border

00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:37.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at various checkpoints, 
leaving literature along the way.

00:41:39.647 --> 00:41:41.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon entering the city of Santo Domingo,

00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:46.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we quickly identified 
the large JW.ORG sign at the branch office.

00:41:46.887 --> 00:41:49.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were enthusiastically greeted

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:53.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by many of the 73 Bethel family members.

00:41:53.127 --> 00:41:56.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the preaching work 
is done primarily in Spanish,

00:41:56.397 --> 00:41:59.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers are expanding their ministry

00:41:59.366 --> 00:42:03.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the language of the hearts 
of many peoples and cultures.

00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:06.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are now 5 Haitian Creole 
circuits in the branch territory,

00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:09.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
26 American Sign Language congregations,

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other congregations or groups

00:42:11.512 --> 00:42:15.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Russian, Chinese, Italian and French.

00:42:15.249 --> 00:42:18.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We joined a group of brothers 
and sisters in the field ministry

00:42:18.819 --> 00:42:21.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Chinatown district of Santo Domingo.

00:42:22.256 --> 00:42:24.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our group gave a witness to both Spanish-

00:42:24.425 --> 00:42:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Chinese-speaking people on the streets

00:42:26.894 --> 00:42:30.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—most of whom 
respectfully listened to our message.

00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:35.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Bethel brother, Evan, 
told us of the challenge

00:42:35.436 --> 00:42:37.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he faced when learning the truth.

00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:41.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was finishing medical school

00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:43.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while serving in the Dominican army.

00:42:43.377 --> 00:42:46.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By then I had been serving for six years.

00:42:46.347 --> 00:42:50.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At my aunt’s home, 
I found the Revelation book.

00:42:51.952 --> 00:42:54.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made such an impact on me,

00:42:54.288 --> 00:42:58.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I stole it and read it all on my own.

00:42:58.325 --> 00:43:01.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a vision in chapter 6 of Revelation,

00:43:01.895 --> 00:43:03.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the sixth seal is opened

00:43:03.897 --> 00:43:08.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the skies darken 
and the army commanders hide in caves.

00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That vision impressed me so much

00:43:10.904 --> 00:43:13.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I decided to serve Jehovah.

00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:16.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meant that I 
would have to leave the army

00:43:16.744 --> 00:43:20.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Witnesses are neutral.

00:43:20.414 --> 00:43:22.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quickly decided to talk 
to my immediate commander

00:43:22.983 --> 00:43:26.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask him 
to please discharge me from the army.

00:43:26.387 --> 00:43:29.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he rejected my request and said:

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:33.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, you have served 
in the army for six years.

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to stay in the army.”

00:43:35.729 --> 00:43:38.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not concerned 
because I could still appeal

00:43:38.432 --> 00:43:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the colonel in charge of personnel.

00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:43.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, my request 
for resignation was rejected again.

00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:45.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left and went into the hallway.

00:43:45.673 --> 00:43:47.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah:

00:43:47.107 --> 00:43:48.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to serve you.

00:43:48.575 --> 00:43:50.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What should I do?

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help me find a way out of this!”

00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:55.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I opened my eyes, 
another army officer approached

00:43:55.249 --> 00:43:57.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and greeted me using my name.

00:43:57.985 --> 00:43:59.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still don’t know who he was.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked me, 
“What do you need?”

00:44:02.022 --> 00:44:06.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained that I wanted to resign 
in order to become a Jehovah’s Witness.

00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:09.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Don’t worry, 
give me your papers.

00:44:09.263 --> 00:44:11.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m the colonel’s assistant.”

00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:15.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within 20 minutes, my discharge papers 
were ready and approved.

00:44:16.136 --> 00:44:18.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a short period of time, 
I became a publisher

00:44:18.138 --> 00:44:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got baptized 
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:23.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this time, 
I have been serving happily in Bethel

00:44:23.444 --> 00:44:26.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 11 years with my wife, Jael.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:34.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt, Jehovah helps 
those who put their complete trust in him.

00:44:34.054 --> 00:44:37.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch is blessed 
to have as part of their Bethel family

00:44:37.358 --> 00:44:40.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some who had been longtime missionaries.

00:44:40.361 --> 00:44:42.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed a very pleasant visit

00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with five of the senior members of this group

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:48.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—three of whom are 98 years of age.

00:44:48.969 --> 00:44:52.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Dingman 
is of the first class of Gilead.

00:44:52.973 --> 00:44:55.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wife, Estelle, attended the 12th class.

00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:58.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thelma Critz is also of the 12th class.

00:44:58.846 --> 00:45:02.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Barbara Parker is of the 42nd class,

00:45:02.049 --> 00:45:05.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Helen Ferrari 
attended the 2nd class of Gilead.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:08.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate the length 
of their full-time service

00:45:08.021 --> 00:45:10.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the fact that Sister Ferrari

00:45:10.858 --> 00:45:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is among those 
who stood up to identify themselves

00:45:13.761 --> 00:45:16.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as part of the great multitude

00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:20.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the 1935 convention in Washington, D.C.

00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The average age of this group is 94.

00:45:24.104 --> 00:45:26.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more impressive

00:45:26.039 --> 00:45:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that their average years 
of full-time service is 73.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These faithful ones set a fine example

00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:35.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continuing to be active in the ministry

00:45:35.015 --> 00:45:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—taking into account 
their ages and health limitations.

00:45:38.285 --> 00:45:40.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such loyal servants of Jehovah are considered

00:45:40.854 --> 00:45:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual treasures wherever they may serve.

00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:46.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I still have one study so far,

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.395 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
although my eyesight doesn’t allow

00:45:48.395 --> 00:45:49.596 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
me to do too much.

00:45:49.596 --> 00:45:51.965 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I try.

00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:54.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My legs aren’t so good for walking,

00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:58.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they wheel me around.

00:45:58.238 --> 00:46:01.308 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In all of my life, I would consider

00:46:01.308 --> 00:46:05.179 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the life that I have spent as a missionary

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:08.782 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and in Dominican Republic as well

00:46:08.782 --> 00:46:12.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s a wonderful life.

00:46:12.719 --> 00:46:15.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t have chosen

00:46:15.923 --> 00:46:18.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a better companion

00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:21.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also a better life

00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:23.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than to be preaching

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:26.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the message of the good news of the Kingdom.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Dominican Republic Bethel family

00:46:28.569 --> 00:46:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
considers it a privilege 
to have a share in providing

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
care for such faithful ones.

00:46:34.341 --> 00:46:38.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Sunday, March the 12th, 
a special program was held

00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:42.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the open-air Assembly Hall 
adjacent to the branch office.

00:46:42.282 --> 00:46:45.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A total of 3,050 benefited

00:46:45.352 --> 00:46:48.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the spiritual program 
and Christian association.

00:46:48.622 --> 00:46:52.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The visits to the Dominican Republic 
and Haiti branches

00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proved to be 
an encouragement and a spiritual blessing

00:46:54.862 --> 00:46:58.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all who participated in them.

00:46:58.465 --> 00:47:02.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Brother Molchan for that report

00:47:02.436 --> 00:47:06.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for sharing those motivating experiences

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:09.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of longtime servants of Jehovah.

00:47:10.777 --> 00:47:15.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example of this 
are Richard and Peggy Kelsey.

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:21.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has he, 
with the support of his dear wife,

00:47:21.221 --> 00:47:23.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proved to be one of the “gifts in men”

00:47:23.824 --> 00:47:27.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout his decades of full-time service?

00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in a little town

00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:36.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called Adair, Iowa

00:47:36.203 --> 00:47:38.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—actually out on the farm​—

00:47:38.305 --> 00:47:42.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was in 1930.

00:47:42.175 --> 00:47:44.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1931,

00:47:44.545 --> 00:47:47.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also in a small town in Iowa.

00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father wanted to be a farmer.

00:47:50.183 --> 00:47:53.387 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we moved to a farm,
and I grew up on a farm.

00:47:53.387 --> 00:47:56.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then the Watchtower Study
of a little group,

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then a little congregation
was in our home.

00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And happily, when Peggy’s father
came into the truth,

00:48:04.231 --> 00:48:08.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the family came to our place
to the Watchtower Study.

00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:13.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was—I guess at that time—
eight or nine,

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Peggy was one year younger.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the thing was,
they moved away just after about one year.

00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:27.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I started pioneering
in September 1948.

00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:29.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead was what I wanted.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t apply for Bethel

00:48:32.059 --> 00:48:34.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I liked the field service,

00:48:34.161 --> 00:48:36.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I thought South America, Africa,

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
countries where there is still so much to do

00:48:39.766 --> 00:48:41.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what I wanted.

00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was called to Gilead

00:48:45.405 --> 00:48:50.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1951, in February.

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:54.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The assignment after attending Gilead

00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:56.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a great surprise.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:00.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Schroeder, one of the instructors,

00:49:00.053 --> 00:49:02.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “You will have

00:49:02.456 --> 00:49:05.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a very wonderful opportunity,

00:49:05.692 --> 00:49:08.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“being assigned to the German Bethel.

00:49:08.128 --> 00:49:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are brothers there

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:14.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“who have been in concentration camps
for up to nine years,

00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:18.171 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and you can learn very much
from these brothers.”

00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:21.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And that was very true.

00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:26.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1953,
at the convention in New York,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a beautiful young sister

00:49:30.283 --> 00:49:34.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing in the cafeteria line
next to my cafeteria line.

00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:36.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I looked twice,

00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:38.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was Peggy.

00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:41.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were together
for the rest of the convention

00:49:41.795 --> 00:49:45.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and decided that we would correspond
and think about serving together.

00:49:45.966 --> 00:49:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1955 we married.

00:49:51.805 --> 00:49:55.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had received 
the assignment to circuit work.

00:49:55.175 --> 00:49:58.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned to northern Germany.

00:49:58.178 --> 00:50:01.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we began circuit work, I was 24.

00:50:01.782 --> 00:50:04.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt completely inadequate

00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:07.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I’d been serving in Bethel

00:50:07.287 --> 00:50:10.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had no training

00:50:10.657 --> 00:50:15.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would qualify me
to serve as a circuit overseer

00:50:15.595 --> 00:50:17.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that was my feeling.

00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:21.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first place,
the sisters with me always got nervous

00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:24.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with me not being able to speak correctly.

00:50:24.705 --> 00:50:27.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they would take over the conversation,

00:50:27.507 --> 00:50:30.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I stood there
and didn’t understand anything.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with time, you pick it up.

00:50:33.346 --> 00:50:36.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After two years,
I could understand everything

00:50:36.183 --> 00:50:38.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the theocratic language,

00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:41.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the kitchen I was still lost.

00:50:41.888 --> 00:50:46.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was nine years for circuit work
and, at the conclusion, district work.

00:50:46.893 --> 00:50:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we were called back into Bethel.

00:50:52.733 --> 00:50:55.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The biggest shock for me

00:50:55.535 --> 00:50:58.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when Brother Knorr asked me

00:50:58.205 --> 00:51:02.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I would be branch overseer.

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:05.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was at the convention

00:51:05.545 --> 00:51:08.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1969 in Nuremberg.

00:51:08.315 --> 00:51:12.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite different arguments 
that I presented,

00:51:12.452 --> 00:51:16.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a letter later saying
that I’d have that assignment.

00:51:17.591 --> 00:51:19.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For about 40 years,

00:51:19.693 --> 00:51:23.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had the wonderful privilege
of doing zone work or,

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:28.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it’s now stated,
being representative of headquarters.

00:51:28.235 --> 00:51:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was wonderful to visit

00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somewhat over 90 different countries.

00:51:34.508 --> 00:51:39.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We became acquainted
with Jehovah’s lovely family

00:51:39.112 --> 00:51:41.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the worldwide brotherhood, the unity,

00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:44.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing how the brothers everywhere

00:51:44.584 --> 00:51:46.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are devoted to Jehovah

00:51:46.953 --> 00:51:49.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and want to serve him faithfully

00:51:49.022 --> 00:51:52.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under sometimes very difficult conditions.

00:51:52.759 --> 00:51:56.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say,
sometimes we benefited more

00:51:56.797 --> 00:52:00.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the visit 
than the brothers we were visiting

00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:04.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was so faith-strengthening.

00:52:04.704 --> 00:52:07.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got this privilege

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of traveling 
to many branches in the zone work,

00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:15.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were able to engage in the field ministry

00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:18.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in numerous countries,

00:52:18.819 --> 00:52:21.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which I never would have had, of course,

00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:23.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I would have just gone 
into missionary service.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said to myself,

00:52:26.393 --> 00:52:30.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Accept every assignment 
Jehovah gives you

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:34.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll find that you have
the greatest blessings possible.’

00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:38.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the 1st of January 1952,

00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:42.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been able to keep
full-time service as my career.

00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:44.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s something 
I certainly wouldn’t have changed

00:52:44.845 --> 00:52:46.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for anything else.

00:52:46.847 --> 00:52:48.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have often said,

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:53.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where would we be today
if we hadn’t taken up full-time service?”

00:52:53.486 --> 00:52:55.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, we would not have enjoyed

00:52:55.956 --> 00:52:58.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so many things as we have in our lifetime.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many young, 
talented brothers and sisters

00:53:05.465 --> 00:53:07.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are working and helping.

00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:11.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage them to make full-time service

00:53:11.471 --> 00:53:14.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s organization their goal in life.

00:53:18.511 --> 00:53:22.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you one 
of those young, talented brothers or sisters

00:53:22.883 --> 00:53:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who Brother Kelsey mentioned 
could make full-time service a goal?

00:53:28.488 --> 00:53:32.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, keep it in your prayers.

00:53:34.327 --> 00:53:37.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as we look back at our program

00:53:37.998 --> 00:53:41.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the examples of various “gifts in men,”

00:53:41.568 --> 00:53:43.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their wives,

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:47.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and numerous others 
doing all they can for Jehovah,

00:53:47.607 --> 00:53:51.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is it that motivates them

00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:55.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live such self-sacrificing lives?

00:53:55.282 --> 00:53:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love.

00:53:57.284 --> 00:54:01.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the theme 
of this month’s music video

00:54:01.721 --> 00:54:06.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled Brotherly Love.

00:54:18.138 --> 00:54:23.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever you go,
you will have fam’ly near.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:29.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because wherever you go,
Jehovah’s people are there.

00:54:29.482 --> 00:54:32.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll feel love.

00:54:32.452 --> 00:54:38.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll feel love,
A brotherly love.

00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feel the love.

00:54:47.434 --> 00:54:58.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters all over the world
Unite with Jehovah and follow his Son

00:54:58.445 --> 00:55:03.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To bring you love—
A nation of,

00:55:03.383 --> 00:55:14.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of brotherly love.
So feel the love.

00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:39.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Father provides for us all—
No one left over.

00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:44.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deep in the jungle 
or on mountains high,

00:55:44.958 --> 00:55:50.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In big, modern cities 
or on islands afar,

00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:59.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You belong.
You belong to the people of God.

00:56:01.875 --> 00:56:05.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feel the love.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:31.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Father provides for us all—
No, no one left over.

00:56:31.337 --> 00:56:42.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the world, it can be cold—
A scary place, truth to be told.

00:56:42.715 --> 00:56:53.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how wonderful it is to know
The one true God and his people!

00:56:57.864 --> 00:57:02.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, he taught 
his disciples to love.

00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:08.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So millions of people, 
as a nation, they show

00:57:08.475 --> 00:57:16.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love— 
And you belong among all of them.

00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:23.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feel the love.

00:57:31.231 --> 00:57:34.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feel the love.

00:57:41.774 --> 00:57:44.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful song

00:57:44.377 --> 00:57:48.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a good reminder that one way

00:57:48.014 --> 00:57:51.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can show our love to Jehovah and Jesus

00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:56.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by showing love, 
respect, and appreciation

00:57:56.489 --> 00:58:01.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the “gifts in men” 
they have generously given us.

00:58:02.695 --> 00:58:06.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, before we end the program,

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have a special treat.

00:58:09.602 --> 00:58:14.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our postcard this month 
comes from right here

00:58:14.107 --> 00:58:17.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our JW Broadcasting studio.

00:58:17.477 --> 00:58:21.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you get 
a sneak peek behind the scenes

00:58:21.714 --> 00:58:24.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how our broadcast is produced.

00:58:24.884 --> 00:58:27.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, a group of brothers and sisters

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set aside their regular Bethel work 
for parts of three days.

00:58:32.392 --> 00:58:34.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early on the first day,

00:58:34.394 --> 00:58:38.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the director reviews 
the “shot list” with crew members.

00:58:38.731 --> 00:58:41.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “shot list” is a series of photographs

00:58:41.367 --> 00:58:45.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing how the cameras 
will record each scene.

00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:50.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the control room, 
media is prepared for display

00:58:50.443 --> 00:58:52.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the studio’s video screen.

00:58:53.813 --> 00:58:58.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The microphones and cameras 
are all properly adjusted.

00:58:58.117 --> 00:59:02.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the crew rehearses 
the entire program several times

00:59:02.822 --> 00:59:07.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while a stand-in substitutes 
for the program host.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:11.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This allows the real host 
to concentrate on his other work

00:59:11.297 --> 00:59:14.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these technical rehearsals.

00:59:14.901 --> 00:59:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the third day, 
the actual host reports

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:20.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the studio’s makeup room,

00:59:20.206 --> 00:59:24.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where wardrobe makes sure 
that he looks his best.

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:27.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before recording begins,

00:59:27.213 --> 00:59:30.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the crew assembles for a brief meeting.

00:59:30.216 --> 00:59:33.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The host often gives a few brief comments,

00:59:33.319 --> 00:59:37.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the floor director gives 
any final instruction to the crew.

00:59:38.124 --> 00:59:41.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a prayer, 
everyone takes their positions.

00:59:41.894 --> 00:59:44.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within a few hours,

00:59:44.163 --> 00:59:48.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire recording 
for that month’s program is completed.

00:59:49.602 --> 00:59:54.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our hardworking brothers 
and sisters that work in the studio

00:59:54.607 --> 00:59:59.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happily send you 
their warm love and greetings.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting

01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:07.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the world headquarters

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:10.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
