‎Welcome to the program! 

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We have many spiritual gems 
‎to share with you. 

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎For example,

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how can we build a good relationship

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with Jehovah despite a difficult upbringing? 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The story of Dimitris and Agis 

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is very encouraging. 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And how can we continue 
‎to honor our marriage mate,

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even if he or she is an unbeliever? 

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Notice how Emma has learned

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:34.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to do just that 
‎with her husband, Thomas,

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎despite their differences. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And this month’s music video highlights

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who really is a true friend. 

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This is the November 2018 program

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:50.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of JW Broadcasting!

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our adversary, Satan the Devil,

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎will do all he can to break our integrity

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and destroy our friendship with Jehovah. 

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Meet Brother Viktor Winter. 

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He is a Russian brother 
‎who lives in Germany. 

00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:29.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In 1958, at the age of 21,

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Brother Winter was sent 
‎to a Siberian labor camp

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎simply for practicing his faith in Jehovah. 

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:40.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In total, he spent 13 years

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in multiple Soviet prison camps

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and 5 years in exile. 

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Despite the persecution,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he maintained his Christian qualities.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎On July 24, 1958,

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I got baptized; 
‎and on November 5, 1958, 

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I already got arrested 
‎for refusal to do military service.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:14.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The second time I was convicted was again 

00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:17.220 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎for refusal to do military service.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.623 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎The next court trial took place in 1963.

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I got seven years
‎​—⁠and five years exile. 

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They added three years  

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that I did not serve 
‎for refusal to go to the army.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was taken to Mordovia.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This was the first camp 
‎where all believers were put, 

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎amongst them 360 of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The detentions were very strict 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because around this time the governments 

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and party politics changed. 

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:55.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They decided that prisoners must suffer hunger.

00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The food rations were cut. 

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:05.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This was very difficult, very difficult, I must say.

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:09.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And the winters can be cold. 

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Even in March, it could get as cold 

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as 35 degrees Celsius
‎​—⁠minus 35 (-31°F).

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:21.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Spiritual things were for all of us

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎​—⁠the brothers in this camp​—
‎⁠top priority. 

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎First of all, all 360 people 

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were divided into four congregations, 

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:34.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and every congregation was divided into groups.

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Every congregation 
‎had responsible brothers as overseers

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and so had every group. 

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:43.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We conducted the study not just once a week, 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but we conducted the study every day, 

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎every day. 

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And brothers took this very seriously. 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had no time for any worldly thoughts.

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Every Saturday and Sunday, 

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we had a very powerful choir​
‎—⁠men’s voices. 

00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:05.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When we were singing, 
‎we stationed guards 

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:09.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎near the oversight house 
‎where supervisors were on duty. 

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And if one of them came out, 
‎it was signaled 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from one brother to the next 
‎so that if he or they came closer, 

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:20.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we would already be gone. 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But the most interesting thing 

00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:26.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was that we were singing in the zone. 

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:28.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We were the prisoners, 

00:04:28.918 --> 00:04:31.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but our listeners were outside. 

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They were sitting up in the trees

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎​—⁠the children of the supervisors, 

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎officers, and guards. 

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And they were listening to our choir.

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎All together during that time, 

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was in seven prison camps. 

00:04:48.237 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I spent about 13 years there 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and another 5 years in exile in Siberia.

00:04:56.946 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But when I was convicted the last time, 

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the head of the interrogation department 
‎came into my cell and said, 

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:07.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Viktor, when you finish all your prison terms, 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎you will have nothing at all​
‎—⁠no family, no children.” 

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I smiled at him and asked: 

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“How do you know this, 
‎Citizen Lieutenant Colonel? 

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:20.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I don’t know it either, 
‎but I do trust in Jehovah.”

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Today, I do have a family 

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and do have my wife and my children. 

00:05:28.444 --> 00:05:31.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We continue to serve Jehovah. 

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:33.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And my greatest joy 

00:05:33.983 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is when my six-year-old granddaughter 

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎stands next to me in the Kingdom Hall 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and sings songs that praise Jehovah.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, to make it simple, 
‎I would put it this way: 

00:05:48.364 --> 00:05:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Preserve your love 
‎for Jehovah and for your brothers. 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:57.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Joy in Jehovah’s service
‎​—⁠never lose it!

00:05:57.707 --> 00:06:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We will not fear anything bad

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:03.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎​—⁠neither cold nor hunger​—⁠

00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:06.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎nothing.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Did you notice the evil words

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the head 
‎of the interrogation department? 

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“You will have nothing at all

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—no family, no children.” 

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:23.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Today, Brother Winter 
‎is over 80 years old. 

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What a blessing, as you can see,

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that he is now surrounded by a big family! 

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:33.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎By maintaining his theocratic routine

00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:35.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even under persecution,

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Brother Winter 
‎avoided developing bitter feelings

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎toward his persecutors.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:42.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In this way,

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he maintained 
‎his relationship with Jehovah

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:50.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he conquered 
‎the evil with the good.

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:55.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And that is also the theme 
‎for this month’s program:

00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:59.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎“Keep Conquering the Evil With the Good.” 

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:02.205 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎This challenging exhortation

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was written by the apostle Paul 
‎at Romans 12:21. 

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s challenging 
‎because we live in a world

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that is alienated 
‎from God and the truth,

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a world that tries 
‎to squeeze everyone into its mold. 

00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Isaiah 5:20 shows how the world

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎has changed God-given standards. 

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:26.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It reads:

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Woe to those who say 
‎that good is bad

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and bad is good,

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“those who substitute darkness for light

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and light for darkness,

00:07:38.808 --> 00:07:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“those who put bitter for sweet

00:07:41.277 --> 00:07:43.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and sweet for bitter!”

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎By adhering to the standard

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“of healthful words” in the Scriptures

00:07:48.518 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and to the examples 
‎of faithful servants of the past,

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we can ‘conquer the evil with the good.’

00:07:57.193 --> 00:07:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The faithful man Enoch was born

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when Adam 
‎was about 600 years old,

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:04.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎which means 
‎that Enoch and Adam

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were contemporaries 
‎for about 300 years. 

00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:11.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, there is no record

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of any contact between them 
‎during that period of time. 

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:19.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Scriptures indicate 
‎that violence and hate for God

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:23.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎Many centuries later,

00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the disciple Jude described 
‎the fear-inspiring prophecy

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that God gave to Enoch

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:34.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about Jehovah coming 
‎with his holy myriads,

‎legions of mighty angels in battle array,

00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to bring destruction to all the ungodly. 

00:08:42.138 --> 00:08:45.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Enoch fearlessly went about declaring

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the coming judgment and destruction and,

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:51.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what is more, he did it alone!

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:56.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The prophecy was fulfilled
‎in the global Deluge,

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and it set the pattern

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of a greater destruction yet to come.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:06.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎No wonder that Genesis 5:24 tells us

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that “Enoch kept walking 
‎with the true God.” 

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Enoch’s example gives us courage

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:16.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to remain firm for true worship

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:20.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even if family and friends
‎stand apart from us. 

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:24.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Enoch did not try to fit in
‎with the evil crowd

00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the pre-Flood world,

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:28.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we don’t want to fit in

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:31.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with the present dying world
‎and its evil ways. 

00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:34.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We may feel alone at times,

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:39.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but we are reminded 
‎that Jehovah never abandoned Enoch,

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and neither will He abandon
‎His faithful servants today. 

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We imitate Enoch

00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:50.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by not allowing 
‎the evil surrounding us

00:09:50.439 --> 00:09:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to undermine our faith in Jehovah.

00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:58.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Like Enoch, we can 
‎‘conquer the evil with the good’

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by avoiding bad associations,

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎sticking close to Jehovah God

00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:06.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the earthly part of his organization,

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and boldly proclaiming the good news.

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Elisha the prophet

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎refused to engage in ‘paying evil for evil,’

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even when it seemed justified.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The account is found

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at 2 Kings 6:14-23. 

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Syria was at war with Israel.

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:33.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The king of Syria was enraged

00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because Elisha 
‎was able to foresee wherever it was

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:40.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Syria was planning 
‎to ambush the Israelites. 

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Elisha would warn 
‎the king of Israel, and he, in turn,

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would keep his troops away
‎from the place of ambush. 

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The king of Syria became exasperated

00:10:53.336 --> 00:10:57.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and wanted desperately 
‎to take the prophet Elisha captive

00:10:57.506 --> 00:11:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to stop him 
‎from warning the king of Israel. 

00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It came about 
‎that the king of Syria learned

00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:08.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Elisha was in the city of Dothan,

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:10.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so the king sent horses,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎war chariots, as well as a large army

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to surround Dothan by night

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in order to take Elisha captive.

00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:21.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The following morning,

00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:23.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah listened to Elisha

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and did something amazing.

00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:29.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He struck the Syrian troops

00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with a temporary form of blindness,

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:34.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Elisha guided all those troops,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎not back to Syria, but to Samaria,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where the king of Israel resided.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The king of Israel was anxious

00:11:43.152 --> 00:11:46.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to strike down and kill the Syrian troops,

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but Elisha said to him,

00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as recorded in verses 22 and 23

00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:54.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of 2 Kings chapter 6:

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who likely thought

‎This astounding turn of events

00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:33.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎How do we know it was better?

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The latter part of verse 23 says:

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:56.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They went out to take Elisha captive. 

00:12:56.992 --> 00:13:00.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, Elisha, 
‎with the help of Jehovah’s spirit,

00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:04.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎had taken

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Syrian king

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when he heard the report.

00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And you can be sure 
‎that the soldiers 

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the Syrian army 
‎were not only grateful

00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:18.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but they acquired

‎and of his prophet Elisha.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The good done to the Syrians

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and have come to appreciate

‎“Perhaps God may give them repentance

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In his letter to Titus

00:16:10.185 --> 00:16:13.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in chapter 3, verses 1 and 2,

00:16:13.355 --> 00:16:16.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Paul gives reminders 
‎on how Christians today

00:16:16.492 --> 00:16:18.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎can ‘conquer the evil with the good’

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:21.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by showing proper respect

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:25.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for governmental authorities
‎wherever we may live. 

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He writes:

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:31.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Continue reminding them 
‎[fellow Christians]

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“to be in subjection and to be obedient

‎“to governments and authorities,

‎“to speak injuriously of no one,

‎“but to be reasonable,

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎displaying all mildness toward all men.” 

00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:56.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Paul followed his own advice.

00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎While in custody in Rome,

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Paul wrote inspired letters

00:17:00.803 --> 00:17:04.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to Christian congregations
‎in Greece and Asia Minor,

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we today benefit 
‎from the counsel in those letters.

00:17:08.744 --> 00:17:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Never do we read in his letters

‎criticism aimed at human rulers

‎to favor one political figure
‎or party over another. 

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He was “no part of the world,”

00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:27.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he knew that man’s only hope

00:17:27.162 --> 00:17:29.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was the Kingdom of God.

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:33.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Paul was a spiritual man,

00:17:33.235 --> 00:17:36.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he ‘conquered the evil with the good’

00:17:36.438 --> 00:17:40.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by following 
‎Jesus’ instructions at Mark 12:17

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of giving “Caesar’s things to Caesar,

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:46.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but God’s things to God,”

00:17:46.949 --> 00:17:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎all the while displaying 
‎“a mildness that belongs to wisdom.”

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:56.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At 1 Peter 2:21,

00:17:56.592 --> 00:17:58.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we receive further direction

00:17:58.627 --> 00:18:01.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about the course that we are to follow.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Peter writes:

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:07.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“In fact,
‎to this course you were called,

00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“because even Christ suffered for you,

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:14.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎leaving a model for you 
‎to follow his steps closely.” 

00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Some of Christ’s steps 
‎are enumerated

00:18:18.247 --> 00:18:21.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in verses 22 and 23,
‎where it reads:

‎“He [Jesus] committed no sin,

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎“When he was suffering,
‎he did not threaten,

00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:40.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“but he entrusted himself

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:43.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the One who judges righteously.”

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:47.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah is 
‎“the One who judges righteously.”

00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:50.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, the Jewish religious leaders

00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:53.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎did not judge the Christ righteously.

00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They insulted Jesus frequently

00:18:56.084 --> 00:18:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and even accused him of having a demon.

00:18:59.621 --> 00:19:01.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jesus did not stoop

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:04.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to “return evil for evil,”

00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎hurling insults or threatening people.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Insults and threats 
‎do not open hearts

00:19:12.434 --> 00:19:15.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to accept the good news.

00:19:15.003 --> 00:19:17.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When Jesus was on trial,

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the Jewish religious leaders
‎spurred the crowd on

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:23.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to cry out for his execution.

00:19:23.178 --> 00:19:26.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Roman authorities 
‎had Jesus nailed to a torture stake

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:30.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to suffer a cruel and excruciating death.

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎While suffering on the torture stake,

00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:36.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what did Jesus speak about?

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Did he curse the Roman soldiers

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who had mistreated him 
‎and were now executing him? 

00:19:41.964 --> 00:19:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎To the contrary,

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he ‘conquered the evil with the good.’

00:19:47.636 --> 00:19:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Among Jesus’ last words

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:54.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are those recorded at Luke 23:34:

00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Father, forgive them,

00:19:56.712 --> 00:20:00.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for they do not know 
‎what they are doing.”

00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:03.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jesus knew 
‎that the Roman soldiers

00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:05.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were ignorant
‎of who he really was

00:20:05.754 --> 00:20:08.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and did not know 
‎what they were doing.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He could forgive them with the hope

00:20:10.893 --> 00:20:12.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that they would eventually respond

00:20:12.928 --> 00:20:16.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the truth and become his disciples.

00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:18.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In every respect,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jesus ‘conquered the evil with the good,’

00:20:21.937 --> 00:20:25.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he always displayed 
‎complete confidence

00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in “the One who judges righteously,”

00:20:28.176 --> 00:20:30.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah God.

00:20:30.612 --> 00:20:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We want to demonstrate the same kind

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of confidence in Jehovah and in his Word

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:39.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Jesus displayed.

00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:42.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We do our best to imitate the Christ

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by applying the spirit-inspired counsel

00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:49.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at Romans 12:17, 18:

00:20:49.564 --> 00:20:54.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Return evil for evil to no one. 

00:20:54.603 --> 00:20:56.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Take into consideration

00:20:56.939 --> 00:21:00.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“what is fine 
‎from the viewpoint of all men. 

00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:03.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:07.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎be peaceable with all men.” 

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Heeding this counsel 
‎is particularly important

00:21:10.218 --> 00:21:13.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in homes that are religiously divided.

00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:17.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Christian mate resists the temptation

00:21:17.292 --> 00:21:19.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to repay an unkind word or act

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with another unkindness.

00:21:22.164 --> 00:21:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Really, no good comes 
‎from ‘returning evil for evil.’ 

00:21:27.102 --> 00:21:30.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎On the contrary, such an attitude

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎can only aggravate the situation.

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the domestic setting,

00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:38.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a wife who shows genuine kindness
‎to her husband 

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎after he makes unpleasant comments
‎about her beliefs 

00:21:42.584 --> 00:21:46.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎may well diffuse
‎a potentially explosive situation.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:53.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At Proverbs 31:12, 
‎we are told how a capable, God-fearing wife

00:21:53.328 --> 00:21:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎deals with her husband:

00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:59.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“She rewards him with good,

00:21:59.034 --> 00:22:02.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎not bad, all the days of her life.”

00:22:02.871 --> 00:22:05.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Additionally, by taking “into consideration

00:22:05.807 --> 00:22:08.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what is fine from the viewpoint of all men,”

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah’s people 
‎have often overcome prejudice

00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:14.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by providing practical assistance

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:16.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to their neighbors as opportunity affords,

00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:20.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and particularly when a disaster strikes.

00:22:20.722 --> 00:22:23.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We conscientiously adhere

00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:27.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to Romans 12:19, which states:

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:30.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,

00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:35.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“but yield place to the wrath;
‎for it is written:

00:22:35.203 --> 00:22:37.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘“Vengeance is mine;

00:22:37.506 --> 00:22:40.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I will repay,” says Jehovah.’”

00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The footnote on verse 19 shows

00:22:44.146 --> 00:22:48.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Paul is telling us 
‎to yield to “God’s wrath,” or anger.

00:22:48.984 --> 00:22:52.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah is the one 
‎who will set matters straight,

00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:56.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he will do it 
‎much better than we ever could.

00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As James 1:20 states:

00:22:59.694 --> 00:23:04.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Man’s anger 
‎does not bring about God’s righteousness.”

‎The theme of this discussion

00:23:07.602 --> 00:23:09.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is summarized exquisitely

00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:13.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at Romans 12:20, 21

00:23:13.241 --> 00:23:17.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with this direction 
‎to all of Jehovah’s people:

00:23:17.712 --> 00:23:22.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“But ‘if your enemy is hungry, feed him;

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:27.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘if he is thirsty, 
‎give him something to drink;

‎“for by doing this 
‎you will heap fiery coals on his head.’ 

00:23:32.027 --> 00:23:36.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,

00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:40.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but keep conquering the evil with the good.”

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Let’s now turn 
‎to a modern-day example

00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:49.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of conquering evil with good.

00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:51.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In South Korea,

00:23:51.213 --> 00:23:54.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎19,000 of our brothers 
‎have at some point

00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎But inside the prison walls,

00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎our brothers have the support 
‎of their fellow Christians. 

00:24:04.793 --> 00:24:08.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We met a group 
‎of brothers who still cherish 

00:24:08.163 --> 00:24:11.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the friendships 
‎they developed while imprisoned,

00:24:11.233 --> 00:24:14.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎although it’s been about 40 years

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:16.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎since their release.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When I was 21 years old,

00:24:27.949 --> 00:24:29.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was sent to prison

00:24:29.518 --> 00:24:32.020 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎in the Nonsan military training center

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.857 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎because I refused to serve in the military.

00:24:36.791 --> 00:24:39.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The soldier working 
‎in the military prison came

00:24:39.961 --> 00:24:42.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and started to beat me, 
‎and he beat me relentlessly.

00:24:45.634 --> 00:24:49.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It was late December 1975.

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Four of the brothers were put

00:24:51.473 --> 00:24:53.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎into standing solitary confinement cells

00:24:53.708 --> 00:24:57.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎called dokgeochang.

00:24:57.379 --> 00:25:00.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It literally feels like you are in a coffin.

00:25:02.317 --> 00:25:04.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The outside temperature dropped

00:25:04.986 --> 00:25:07.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to minus 13 degrees Celsius (8°F),

00:25:07.155 --> 00:25:09.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and cold air seeped out from the wet walls.

00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:17.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The brothers couldn’t lay down to sleep,
‎so they had to crouch, 

00:25:17.332 --> 00:25:21.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and I could hear them groaning all night.

00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:26.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I extended my hand through the iron bars

00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:29.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the brother in the cell next to mine, 
‎and he did the same. 

00:25:29.377 --> 00:25:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We held hands

00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:34.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and encouraged each other to stay strong.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.356 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎My health condition wasn’t really good

00:25:41.356 --> 00:25:43.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎while serving my prison sentence.

00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:46.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I weighed about 47 kilograms (103 lbs),

00:25:46.695 --> 00:25:49.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and without my family’s support,

00:25:49.264 --> 00:25:53.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was mentally and physically weak. 

00:25:53.268 --> 00:25:56.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Under these extremely difficult circumstances,

00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there were times I wasn’t able to eat at all. 

00:25:59.908 --> 00:26:02.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎During those times, 
‎the brothers provided me 

00:26:02.877 --> 00:26:05.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with porridge
‎—which was easy to digest—

00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:09.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎warm clothing, 
‎and a sleeping bag for the winter. 

00:26:10.952 --> 00:26:14.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I could really feel their love.

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:17.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Having been sent to prison three times,

00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:21.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I truly feel that Jehovah showed interest in me

00:26:21.062 --> 00:26:26.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and took care of me 
‎just as he promised at 1 Peter 5:7. 

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:29.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He especially supported me through my brothers

00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when I was facing difficulties.

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:35.343 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎A day in the prison started

00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:36.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎with us eating breakfast

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:38.980 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and then moving 300 bricks.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:44.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎After lunch, we would have
‎to carry another 300 bricks.

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Because I usually finished my work early,

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:50.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I had a 20-minute break
‎before going back in. 

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:54.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, this brother named Park Byung-Man

00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:58.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who was much stronger
‎and bigger than I was

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:00.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎carried bricks all day long.

00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:04.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I found out later that Park Byung-Man

00:27:04.439 --> 00:27:06.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was carrying Choi Sung-Kyu’s share

00:27:06.474 --> 00:27:09.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of bricks because of his frail health.

00:27:09.644 --> 00:27:14.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This kind of brotherly love really moved me

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to start studying the Bible.

00:27:16.318 --> 00:27:18.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I got baptized a year later

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:21.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in April of 1977 in the Anyang Prison.

00:27:22.824 --> 00:27:25.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎After getting baptized,

00:27:25.026 --> 00:27:27.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎my mother passed away,

00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and two months before being released,

00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:32.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎my father passed away as well.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So that time was especially difficult for me.

00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:39.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But the brothers encouraged me

00:27:39.074 --> 00:27:41.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with their warm words and kind gestures.

00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:44.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Their encouragement really touched me

00:27:44.312 --> 00:27:47.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and helped me to endure until I was released.

00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:56.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎One time, I had a severe stomachache.

00:27:56.491 --> 00:28:00.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The symptoms were not getting any better

00:28:00.228 --> 00:28:02.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with the medication I was given,

00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:06.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so I was having a very difficult time.

00:28:06.201 --> 00:28:09.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎One day, we were served some vegetables

00:28:09.237 --> 00:28:12.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as a side dish

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and one brother crushed

00:28:14.743 --> 00:28:16.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and squeezed the vegetables
‎to make juice for me. 

00:28:18.913 --> 00:28:22.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He cared for me that way for several days. 

00:28:22.217 --> 00:28:26.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I really would like to see that self-sacrificing

00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:29.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and loving brother once again.

00:28:29.023 --> 00:28:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At the time, none of our publications

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎other than the Bible were allowed into the prison. 

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Of course, that included our songbook.

00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:41.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The brothers memorized

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the lyrics from the songbook,

00:28:43.204 --> 00:28:45.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they would write them down.

00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:48.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Also, there were some songs

00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:50.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that were sung at the regional convention.

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:54.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎Songs like . . .

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:08.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or

00:29:20.475 --> 00:29:25.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We sang them silently together
‎even in this isolated place. 

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:28.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It was a great source of encouragement

00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:30.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to share the love among our fellow brothers.

00:29:30.985 --> 00:29:33.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I remember this encouraging scripture

00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:37.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from 1 Corinthians 10:13.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It says that Jehovah 
‎‘does not let us be tempted

00:29:40.295 --> 00:29:43.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘beyond what we can bear
‎and will make the way out

00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:46.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so we may endure it.’

00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:49.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Although there were many challenges, 
‎I was convinced 

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Jehovah would always

00:29:51.272 --> 00:29:54.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎make a way out through our fellow brothers.

00:29:54.142 --> 00:29:56.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Even though 40 years have passed,

00:29:56.644 --> 00:30:00.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when we look back at those days,
‎the memories are still fresh

00:30:00.815 --> 00:30:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we are moved to tears at times. 

00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:06.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So to make a meaningful trip

00:30:06.154 --> 00:30:08.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎out of our 40 years of friendship,

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:11.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎all the friends who went through the same trials

00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:14.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎decided to visit the headquarters 
‎in the United States together.

00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:22.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s really refreshing to be here 
‎with everyone again today. 

00:30:24.372 --> 00:30:26.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It feels like I’m taking a field trip.

00:30:34.148 --> 00:30:37.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was especially moved to tears

00:30:37.385 --> 00:30:39.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when I saw our old prison uniforms

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there in the museum

00:30:41.523 --> 00:30:45.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at world headquarters
‎displayed in the neutrality section.

00:30:48.162 --> 00:30:51.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎While on the tour, the brothers sat

00:30:51.499 --> 00:30:54.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and lay down on the floor
‎inside the dokgeochang 

00:30:56.004 --> 00:30:57.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we were able to reflect on the times

00:30:57.772 --> 00:30:59.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we spent together in prison.

00:31:03.044 --> 00:31:05.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our gratitude to Jehovah

00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:08.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for giving us such loyal friends was renewed.

00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:16.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yes, through their brotherly love

00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the power and strength

00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:20.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎given to them by holy spirit,

00:31:20.895 --> 00:31:22.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎our Korean brothers were able

00:31:22.931 --> 00:31:26.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to conquer the evil with the good.

00:31:26.834 --> 00:31:29.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Although we may not be imprisoned,

00:31:29.537 --> 00:31:33.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎having true friends 
‎can help us through many trials.

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:37.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But what is a true friend?

00:31:37.412 --> 00:31:39.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Where can we find them,

00:31:39.614 --> 00:31:43.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and why are they so important?

00:31:43.184 --> 00:31:46.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our music video will answer these questions.

00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:50.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It is entitled True Friends.

00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:14.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎in these last days.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎to help us 
‎along the way.

00:32:35.103 --> 00:32:43.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, remember what

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:29.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So if troubles appear,
‎don’t give in or fight. 

00:33:29.891 --> 00:33:33.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Say a prayer;

‎we all

‎True friends

00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:18.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎that’s a true friend.

00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:22.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Someone you trust,

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:28.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Someone who cares 
‎about you serving Jehovah,

00:34:28.683 --> 00:34:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎A shoulder to lean on

00:34:36.557 --> 00:34:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yeah, 
‎that’s a true friend.

00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:58.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎True friends
‎Love you when you’re down,

00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:03.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎Keep you on track

00:35:37.585 --> 00:35:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Help you keep Jehovah

00:35:44.258 --> 00:35:47.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yeah, 
‎that’s a true friend.

00:35:47.695 --> 00:35:51.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s a true friend.

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:55.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Oh, 
‎that’s a true friend.

00:35:59.373 --> 00:36:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What a blessing it is to have true friends

00:36:02.677 --> 00:36:06.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎around us in the Christian congregation!

00:36:06.113 --> 00:36:08.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But at times,

00:36:08.115 --> 00:36:11.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎our imperfection may create roadblocks

00:36:11.452 --> 00:36:14.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎between us and our dear friends,

00:36:14.322 --> 00:36:16.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we may start developing

00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎negative feelings about them. 

00:36:19.493 --> 00:36:22.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In this Bethel morning worship,

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎pay attention to how Brother Geoffrey Jackson 
‎of the Governing Body

00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:30.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎helps us deal with such thinking.

00:36:30.471 --> 00:36:33.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, perhaps we could take our Bibles 

00:36:33.007 --> 00:36:37.044 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and turn to Colossians 3:​13. 

00:36:37.044 --> 00:36:39.513 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎And let’s analyze this verse together 

00:36:39.513 --> 00:36:43.584 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and see what it is that Jehovah expects of us.

00:36:43.584 --> 00:36:46.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So in Colossians 3:​13,

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it says: 
‎“Continue putting up with one another

00:36:49.657 --> 00:36:52.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and forgiving one another freely

00:36:52.026 --> 00:36:55.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“even if anyone has a cause 
‎for complaint against another.

00:36:55.897 --> 00:36:58.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:01.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎you must also do the same.”

00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:03.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, certainly this verse

00:37:03.437 --> 00:37:06.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎gives us plenty of food for thought
‎​—doesn’t it?​—

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎areas in which, perhaps, 
‎we can work on and improve in.

00:37:10.378 --> 00:37:12.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But what two things stand out

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as being required of us?

00:37:15.049 --> 00:37:17.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, looking back, 
‎you notice the first one,

00:37:17.585 --> 00:37:20.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“continue putting up with one another,”

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:22.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and then the second point,

00:37:22.723 --> 00:37:25.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“forgiving one another freely.”

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, let’s look at that first expression:

00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:30.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Continue putting up with one another.”

00:37:30.765 --> 00:37:34.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, what’s the difference 
‎between these two expressions?

00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:37.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, we’re told that this first expression

00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:41.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎doesn’t refer to serious sins 
‎but perhaps talks about things

00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:44.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that are irritating, annoying,

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:47.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎things that we may not necessarily

00:37:47.048 --> 00:37:49.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎have a cause for complaint concerning,

00:37:49.417 --> 00:37:52.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but they still get us very upset anyway

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎​—these minor things.

00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:57.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What are some of the things that annoy you?

00:37:57.658 --> 00:38:00.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Let’s be honest.

00:38:00.394 --> 00:38:05.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Are you annoyed when someone is always late?

00:38:05.132 --> 00:38:09.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Are you annoyed when they’re always early?

00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:13.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Are you annoyed when someone is outspoken?

00:38:13.474 --> 00:38:17.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Does it annoy you when someone is too quiet?

00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:19.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s amazing​
‎—isn’t it?​—

00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:21.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what the things that annoy us are.

00:38:21.282 --> 00:38:25.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I remember back in the ’70’s, 
‎Brother Knorr gave an outstanding talk

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where he alluded to the fact 
‎that maybe there’s a sister in the congregation,

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and she’s hearing 
‎this other sister, new in the truth,

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎answering up time after time,

00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:37.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and in her heart, she’s thinking,

00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:40.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘Why doesn’t she just keep quiet?’ 

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:43.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, maybe we’ve all 
‎experienced those feelings.

00:38:43.637 --> 00:38:47.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And if we’re judged on them,
‎perhaps we’ll agree: 

00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:50.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘Well, it’s not justified; 
‎I don’t really have a cause,

00:38:50.311 --> 00:38:53.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but it still irritates me.’

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s true—isn’t it?​—
‎the expression 

00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:59.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Sometimes it’s not the mountains
‎ahead of us that cause problems, 

00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:01.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it’s the pebble in the shoe.”

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:04.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And it’s sometimes the small things

00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:06.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that irritate us the most.

00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I remember when I was serving

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:11.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in Western Samoa 
‎many years ago at the branch,

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:15.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we had quite a number of brothers 
‎from overseas working on construction.

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:19.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And there was one brother who had
‎the habit of first thing in the morning

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as he arrived before breakfast,

00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:26.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎saying, “Good morning!” to everyone.

00:39:26.914 --> 00:39:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Some found that annoying.

00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:32.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Maybe you can relate to that.

00:39:32.753 --> 00:39:35.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, no doubt, you feel 
‎very happy when you read the scripture

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:39.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at Proverbs 27:14, 
‎where it says in one translation:

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘A loud and cheerful greeting
‎early in the morning 

00:39:42.963 --> 00:39:45.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is taken as a curse.’

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:49.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You may be thinking, ‘Amen to that.’

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And that brother ceased his habit
‎after he read that scripture​

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—or at least it was read to him.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But we may not always be able
‎to find a scripture 

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that backs up this irritation that we feel.

00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:04.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So, what do we do?

00:40:04.685 --> 00:40:06.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, what does it say?

00:40:06.353 --> 00:40:09.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Continue putting up with one another.”

00:40:09.523 --> 00:40:13.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Continue”​—it’s something 
‎that we just have to keep on doing.

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:17.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, that brings us 
‎to the second part of our verse,

00:40:17.098 --> 00:40:20.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“forgiving one another freely.”

00:40:20.401 --> 00:40:24.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s interesting, when we look 
‎at other translations of this verse,

00:40:24.772 --> 00:40:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎most follow the King James Version

00:40:27.608 --> 00:40:30.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and just say “forgive.”

00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:34.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The New World Translation says ‘forgive freely.’

00:40:34.548 --> 00:40:37.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The reason is that this isn’t your normal

00:40:37.084 --> 00:40:39.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Greek word for “forgiveness.”

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It denotes generosity,

00:40:42.823 --> 00:40:46.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a willingness to go beyond what’s required.

00:40:46.594 --> 00:40:51.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s interesting 
‎that The Watchtower even back in 1882

00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:55.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was using that expression, 
‎to ‘forgive one another freely,’

00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:58.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎well before the time 
‎of the New World Translation.

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:01.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So this gives us something to think about

00:41:01.175 --> 00:41:04.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because it’s not just a matter of forgiving,

00:41:04.178 --> 00:41:07.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but we need to be generous about forgiving.

00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:12.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We have to be willing to,  
‎as it were, bestow a pardon

00:41:12.052 --> 00:41:16.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎on someone 
‎who really doesn’t deserve that pardon.

00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:18.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, why should we be interested

00:41:18.425 --> 00:41:21.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in developing 
‎and working on these two aspects:

00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:25.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“putting up with one another”
‎and ‘forgiving freely’? 

00:41:25.766 --> 00:41:29.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, we’ve heard 
‎the reasons many times before, haven’t we?

00:41:29.703 --> 00:41:33.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The first one, of course, 
‎is that Jehovah has forgiven us.

00:41:33.107 --> 00:41:35.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎If we turn back just one chapter,

00:41:35.709 --> 00:41:39.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎chapter 2 of Colossians and verse 13,

00:41:39.647 --> 00:41:42.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎this point is highlighted for us.

00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:45.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It says in chapter 2, verse 13:

00:41:45.452 --> 00:41:48.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Furthermore, though you 
‎were dead in your trespasses

00:41:48.689 --> 00:41:51.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh,

00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:54.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“God made you alive together with him.

00:41:54.195 --> 00:41:59.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“He kindly forgave us

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎all our trespasses.”

00:42:01.468 --> 00:42:04.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So this is the model 
‎that Jehovah has given us.

00:42:04.772 --> 00:42:09.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s true, 
‎we sometimes can find some reason

00:42:09.176 --> 00:42:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎why we feel 
‎we don’t have to forgive someone else.

00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But remember the illustration Jesus gave

00:42:15.182 --> 00:42:17.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the slave who had the huge debt.

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:20.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎If you calculated it in denarius,

00:42:20.154 --> 00:42:24.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there were 60 million denarii that he owed;

00:42:24.258 --> 00:42:26.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he was forgiven that.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Then he went after the other man

00:42:28.495 --> 00:42:30.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who owed him just a small amount.

00:42:30.731 --> 00:42:33.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But have you ever thought 
‎that if you asked that slave,

00:42:33.267 --> 00:42:35.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎maybe he would say: “Well, it’s true.

00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:39.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“I really appreciate having everything forgiven,
‎but I still don’t have any money. 

00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:42.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“I need some money, 
‎so that’s why I wanted to get

00:42:42.409 --> 00:42:45.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the other slave to give me the money.”

00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:47.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, there’s always a reason
‎​—isn’t there?​—

00:42:47.348 --> 00:42:49.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎⁠even if it’s a distorted reason

00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:52.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as to why we don’t follow Jehovah’s example.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But looking back at Colossians 3:​13,
‎what does it say? 

00:42:57.157 --> 00:43:01.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“If anyone has a cause 
‎for complaint against another.”

00:43:01.862 --> 00:43:04.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So that gives us a good idea, doesn’t it?

00:43:04.932 --> 00:43:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The second reason, of course, is that

00:43:07.434 --> 00:43:10.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we do need others to forgive us.

00:43:10.638 --> 00:43:14.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The very things that annoy us

00:43:14.642 --> 00:43:18.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and irritate us in others are sometimes

00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:20.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the same things that we do to others.

00:43:20.281 --> 00:43:22.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Have you ever noticed that?

00:43:22.116 --> 00:43:24.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And how annoying it is 
‎when someone points that out to you:

00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:26.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“You’re annoyed with that person? 

00:43:26.787 --> 00:43:29.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Don’t you realize what you do?”

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, that’s something good for us to remember​
‎—isn’t it?​—

00:43:32.226 --> 00:43:35.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the fact that we do need 
‎to have others forgive us.

00:43:35.296 --> 00:43:37.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And then another reason

00:43:37.298 --> 00:43:41.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is that it maintains the peace 
‎within the Christian congregation.

00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:43.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Watchtower made a comment on this.

00:43:43.937 --> 00:43:48.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It said that in countries 
‎where our work is restricted or under ban,

00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:53.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎many of our brothers 
‎have to meet together in smaller groups.

00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:55.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And when you do that, you get to know

00:43:55.616 --> 00:43:58.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎everyone’s weaknesses and idiosyncrasies.

00:43:58.752 --> 00:44:01.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s so much easier to be annoyed by others

00:44:01.955 --> 00:44:05.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when you’re dealing 
‎with small groups of persons.

00:44:05.025 --> 00:44:07.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Watchtower then made the comment

00:44:07.328 --> 00:44:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what good training it is for us now

00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:12.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to learn how to put up with one another

00:44:12.099 --> 00:44:14.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when we’re in larger groups,

00:44:14.168 --> 00:44:18.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because later we may need 
‎to worship Jehovah in smaller groups.

00:44:18.439 --> 00:44:23.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So it’s good training for us 
‎as we keep peace in the congregation.

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:24.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And what can help us?

00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:28.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, there are many different things
‎that can help us in this regard. 

00:44:28.115 --> 00:44:30.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The one point in the marginal reference

00:44:30.551 --> 00:44:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎you see there is at 1 Peter 4:​8,

00:44:33.854 --> 00:44:35.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and that’s where it tells us we need

00:44:35.856 --> 00:44:39.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to “have intense love for one another”​

00:44:39.593 --> 00:44:42.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—not just love but “intense love.”

00:44:42.196 --> 00:44:45.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And this word “intense” means “full strength.”

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Literally, it means “to stretch out our love.”

00:44:49.236 --> 00:44:54.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So as we come across these things
‎that irritate us, annoy us, in life 

00:44:54.274 --> 00:44:58.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or if we come across persons 
‎who actually do sin against us,

00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:00.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what should we keep in mind?

00:45:00.714 --> 00:45:03.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Continue putting up with one another.”

00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:07.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘Continue freely forgiving one another.’

00:45:07.821 --> 00:45:12.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That sound advice 
‎also applies strongly in marriage,

00:45:12.259 --> 00:45:16.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when two people decide 
‎to share their lives together.

00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:19.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Perhaps your mate is an unbeliever.

00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:21.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Differences in belief

00:45:21.368 --> 00:45:23.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎can cause a level of friction,

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but how one handles, 
‎or conquers, the situation

00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:32.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎can bring you peace 
‎and even be a great witness.

00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How did 15 years go by so fast?

00:45:57.738 --> 00:46:01.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We were so young when we got married

00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:03.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—maybe too young.

00:46:04.778 --> 00:46:06.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had so little in common.

00:46:20.727 --> 00:46:23.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When I started studying the Bible,

00:46:23.263 --> 00:46:27.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I thought Thomas would be as excited
‎as I was to learn the truth.

00:46:40.347 --> 00:46:43.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But every conversation we had on the subject

00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:46.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎seemed to turn into an argument.

00:46:52.826 --> 00:46:57.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Looking back, 
‎I really wish I’d handled it better.

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As the years went by,

00:47:01.869 --> 00:47:05.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he did become more open to discussion.

00:47:21.188 --> 00:47:24.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But it’s been hard worshipping God alone.

00:47:24.224 --> 00:47:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Others in the congregation 
‎are able to serve Jehovah together

00:47:28.228 --> 00:47:31.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and even reach out for theocratic goals

00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:34.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎like the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:47:34.034 --> 00:47:36.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎something I would love to do.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:41.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Why can’t I have a husband 
‎who loves Jehovah like I do?

00:47:41.008 --> 00:47:44.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Abigail probably felt the same way

00:47:44.311 --> 00:47:46.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but with more reason.

00:47:51.818 --> 00:47:54.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Her husband was a bully and a drunkard

00:47:54.855 --> 00:47:58.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and was despised by his entire household.

00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:20.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At that time, 
‎many marriages were arranged,

00:48:20.213 --> 00:48:24.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so Abigail had very little control
‎over her circumstances.

00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:28.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But her words and actions

00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:30.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎showed that she was a spiritual woman

00:48:30.123 --> 00:48:32.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who didn’t focus 
‎on what she could not control

00:48:32.726 --> 00:48:35.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but on what she could.

00:48:35.529 --> 00:48:38.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I determined to do the same.

00:48:38.065 --> 00:48:42.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I meditated on Jesus’ words
‎at Matthew 19:6:

00:48:42.436 --> 00:48:47.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“What God has yoked together,
‎let no man put apart.”

00:48:48.275 --> 00:48:51.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎To Jehovah, marriage is permanent

00:48:51.878 --> 00:48:54.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—even my marriage to an unbeliever.

00:48:54.214 --> 00:48:58.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So instead of dwelling on changing
‎my husband or my marriage,

00:48:58.085 --> 00:49:00.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I focused on changing myself.

00:49:01.455 --> 00:49:03.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thomas does not love Jehovah,

00:49:03.557 --> 00:49:06.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but he’s not a “Nabal” either.

00:49:06.259 --> 00:49:09.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He is loyal, and he loves me.

00:49:09.162 --> 00:49:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He is entitled to the respect that the Bible 
‎commands wives to show to their husbands.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So I’m making an effort 
‎to be more respectful and loving to him.

00:49:17.838 --> 00:49:22.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thomas hasn’t developed an interest
‎in the truth or started studying. 

00:49:22.576 --> 00:49:27.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But I have the satisfaction of knowing
‎my God is pleased with me,

00:49:27.314 --> 00:49:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and I have the same view
‎of marriage that he does.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How exciting!

00:49:55.542 --> 00:50:00.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Is Thomas slowly noticing
‎the benefits of the truth? 

00:50:00.147 --> 00:50:03.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎No doubt, 
‎Emma’s faithful and respectful conduct

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:08.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎has had a deep impact 
‎on how he views Jehovah.

00:50:08.622 --> 00:50:12.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And the truth can really change a person. 

00:50:12.392 --> 00:50:15.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Getting to know Jehovah can help someone

00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to get their life back on track.

00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:20.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Two fleshly brothers,

00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:23.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Dimitris and Agis Sotiropoulos,

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:27.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are good examples of how 
‎the good can conquer the evil

00:50:27.941 --> 00:50:31.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎despite a challenging upbringing.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎My father was a self-made factory owner.

00:50:39.953 --> 00:50:43.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He started a business working
‎with rubber and plastics,

00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:48.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we led a financially comfortable way of life.

00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:52.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But in the middle of the 1970’s,

00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:54.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎things started going badly with his work.

00:50:54.701 --> 00:50:56.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎For this reason,

00:50:56.703 --> 00:50:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he fell into a depression, 
‎and he committed suicide.

00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:01.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This was a great shock.

00:51:04.377 --> 00:51:06.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I went to the wall and wrote the words

00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:08.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“He lives.” 

00:51:08.882 --> 00:51:12.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I didn’t want to believe that from that day on,

00:51:12.819 --> 00:51:14.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I wouldn’t see my father again.

00:51:18.225 --> 00:51:20.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At the age of about ten, I began to develop

‎strong antireligious tendencies.

00:51:23.697 --> 00:51:26.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And later, at the age of 17,

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I also expressed them by participating

00:51:29.936 --> 00:51:31.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in the most important incident

00:51:31.938 --> 00:51:35.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the student movement 
‎against the military junta

00:51:35.108 --> 00:51:39.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that was prevailing in Greece
‎and ruling the country. 

00:51:39.279 --> 00:51:44.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I became a member of the Communist Party.

00:51:44.117 --> 00:51:46.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I went to Santorini and started a business.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I opened a bar.

00:51:49.089 --> 00:51:52.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Of course, all this included unsavory things

00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎like immorality, drugs,

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:58.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and plenty of alcohol.

00:51:58.732 --> 00:52:01.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎A few months later, 
‎I left to study in Germany.

00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:05.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It was the first time I met 
‎a brother engaging in street work.

00:52:05.605 --> 00:52:07.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎People would approach him,

00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:09.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and some would swear;
‎some even spat at him. 

00:52:09.776 --> 00:52:12.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It impressed me immensely

00:52:12.445 --> 00:52:15.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how he stood calmly 
‎and accepted this treatment.

00:52:15.782 --> 00:52:18.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had interesting conversations.

00:52:18.618 --> 00:52:21.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎My studies ended, and I returned to Greece

00:52:21.454 --> 00:52:24.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to take on the responsibility of the factory.

00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:27.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When I finished my studies in Germany,

00:52:27.327 --> 00:52:30.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I left with a sense of deep respect

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The influence of my friends

00:52:36.469 --> 00:52:39.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎led me to go into the military,

00:52:39.472 --> 00:52:42.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and there I saw a huge amount of corruption.

00:52:42.976 --> 00:52:45.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The hope I had that we humans

00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:48.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would be able to succeed
‎without external help 

00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:50.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—without God—
‎began to collapse,

00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:52.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and then the things I had heard

00:52:52.853 --> 00:52:56.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from Jehovah’s Witnesses
‎suddenly came to my mind.

00:52:57.991 --> 00:53:01.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The same afternoon, 
‎I sought out a family friend,

00:53:01.828 --> 00:53:04.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the mother of a childhood friend, named Lily.

00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:07.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I said to her, “Please give me a Bible

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and some Bible study publications
‎because I want to study them.” 

00:53:11.204 --> 00:53:13.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I read everywhere,

00:53:13.206 --> 00:53:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and anything that I didn’t understand,

00:53:15.542 --> 00:53:17.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I wrote down in a notebook.

00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:20.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I got to the point, in just a few days,

00:53:20.714 --> 00:53:23.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where I had written down 80 to 90 questions.

00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:25.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Harry impressed me

00:53:25.986 --> 00:53:28.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because every time I asked him a question,

00:53:28.688 --> 00:53:31.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he gave me the answer from the Bible.

00:53:31.024 --> 00:53:34.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That convinced me that I’d found the truth.

00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:36.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So in that moment,

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:41.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I decided to leave the military 
‎and to quit smoking.

00:53:41.167 --> 00:53:43.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎A few months passed by,

00:53:43.737 --> 00:53:46.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where I was occupied mostly with the factory,

00:53:46.172 --> 00:53:48.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎until I recognized

00:53:48.541 --> 00:53:52.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that for me to make progress in the truth,

00:53:52.078 --> 00:53:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I had to sell my shares in the factory. 

00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:59.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And on July 7, 1984, I was baptized.

00:53:59.019 --> 00:54:02.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The authorities
‎—the police, the mayor,

00:54:02.923 --> 00:54:05.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the health inspectors—
‎began to demand money

00:54:05.392 --> 00:54:08.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so that I could keep the bar open.

00:54:11.097 --> 00:54:13.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I refused all the things they asked of me,

00:54:13.767 --> 00:54:16.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and so the war became harder

00:54:17.704 --> 00:54:22.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎until one night when I went 
‎to open the door to enter my home;

00:54:22.108 --> 00:54:24.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I heard a tramping from behind,

00:54:24.711 --> 00:54:27.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I tried to turn and see,
‎and as I turned,

00:54:27.881 --> 00:54:29.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was hit in the face.

00:54:29.883 --> 00:54:31.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎During that time,

00:54:31.885 --> 00:54:34.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when all of this was happening,
‎my brother Dimitris arrived.

00:54:39.059 --> 00:54:42.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As brothers, 
‎we never really had a relationship.

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When he came to Santorini
‎and began to talk to me

00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:48.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and help me understand 
‎what was happening to me,

00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:53.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I realized that this was a different Dimitris.

00:54:53.106 --> 00:54:56.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I said to him, “I want us 
‎to start studying the Bible together.” 

00:54:56.543 --> 00:54:59.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I had the Bible with me 
‎almost everywhere I went

00:54:59.412 --> 00:55:01.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so that I could read it. 

00:55:01.481 --> 00:55:06.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I realized that Jehovah was helping me 
‎to understand what I was living for. 

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:08.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He was helping me to understand

00:55:08.621 --> 00:55:11.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that I could have a real goal, a purpose,

00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:14.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and a hope.

00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:18.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎On the day of my baptism,
‎I felt that I was drawing closer to Jehovah.

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I felt like my smile went from ear to ear.

00:55:24.504 --> 00:55:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And now with Lydia,

00:55:26.506 --> 00:55:28.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I have the great joy of serving

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:31.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in the Romany territory.

00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We enjoy very nice Bible studies.

00:55:34.914 --> 00:55:36.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It is truly something

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:39.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that shows you Jehovah’s love,

00:55:39.285 --> 00:55:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎interest, and affection

00:55:42.122 --> 00:55:44.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—things that I had felt

00:55:44.124 --> 00:55:46.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎many years ago 
‎when I studied with my brother.

00:55:46.626 --> 00:55:50.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Today, my brother and I 
‎love each other very much.

00:55:50.196 --> 00:55:53.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It is a relationship characterized

00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:56.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by brotherly love

00:55:56.169 --> 00:55:59.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as it is expressed in the Bible.

00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:01.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We are very close to each other.

00:56:01.841 --> 00:56:04.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This is really a change.

00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:08.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now we are truly brothers!

00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:15.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Today, both Dimitris 
‎and Agis serve as elders

00:56:15.488 --> 00:56:18.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and have spent many years
‎in the full-time ministry.

00:56:18.758 --> 00:56:20.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Have you noticed the many ways

00:56:20.827 --> 00:56:24.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we have seen the good conquer 
‎the evil in this month’s broadcast?

00:56:24.464 --> 00:56:26.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our brothers in Korea

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were able to endure unjust imprisonment

00:56:29.869 --> 00:56:32.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with the support of their fellow believers.

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Viktor Winter, 
‎who was also imprisoned,

00:56:36.242 --> 00:56:38.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎conquered the evil

00:56:38.211 --> 00:56:40.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by maintaining a theocratic routine.

00:56:41.581 --> 00:56:44.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our music video helped us appreciate

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the value of our true friends
‎in the congregation,

00:56:46.686 --> 00:56:50.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who will help us fulfill our ministry
‎in this wicked world. 

00:56:51.891 --> 00:56:54.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Also, Brother Jackson

00:56:54.094 --> 00:56:57.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎shared principles to help us
‎overcome negative feelings

00:56:57.363 --> 00:57:01.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we may have about others
‎as a result of our imperfection.

00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:06.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Over time, 
‎Emma learned to apply those principles

00:57:06.039 --> 00:57:08.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in dealing 
‎with her unbelieving husband, Thomas.

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:12.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And finally, 
‎the truth conquered the evil

00:57:12.712 --> 00:57:16.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when the Sotiropoulos brothers
‎were able to clean up their lives.

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:21.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Before we conclude,
‎we have an announcement to make.

00:57:21.254 --> 00:57:23.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You will be happy to know

00:57:23.289 --> 00:57:27.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that the next installment 
‎of the video series Was it Designed?

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎entitled The Seahorse’s Tail

00:57:30.263 --> 00:57:32.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is available on Video on Demand

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:37.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and jw.org starting this month.

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Perhaps you can watch it 
‎during your next Family Worship evening.

00:57:41.908 --> 00:57:44.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Let’s also briefly visit 
‎our brothers and sisters in Portugal.

00:57:46.246 --> 00:57:49.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As the most western country
‎in continental Europe,

00:57:49.616 --> 00:57:52.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Portugal is known 
‎as the place where the land ends

00:57:52.986 --> 00:57:55.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the sea begins.

00:57:55.188 --> 00:57:58.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Mainland Portugal 
‎has over 800 kilometers,

00:57:58.758 --> 00:58:01.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or over 500 miles, of Atlantic Coast.

00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:05.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the southern part of the country,

00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:09.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they have over 3,000 hours
‎of sunshine per year. 

00:58:10.403 --> 00:58:12.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Portugal became world renowned

00:58:12.539 --> 00:58:16.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as a seafaring nation 
‎with colonies around the world.

00:58:18.044 --> 00:58:20.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the 15th century,
‎navigators and explorers

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from Portugal
‎traveled to distant places

00:58:23.383 --> 00:58:27.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎such as Brazil, India, 
‎and many parts of Africa.

00:58:28.488 --> 00:58:32.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The good news reached Portugal in 1925,

00:58:32.392 --> 00:58:34.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but the work was either restricted

00:58:34.394 --> 00:58:39.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or under ban from 1926 to 1974. 

00:58:41.334 --> 00:58:43.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, the brothers 
‎and sisters were good examples

00:58:43.903 --> 00:58:47.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of “conquering the evil with the good.”

00:58:47.207 --> 00:58:50.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Despite the restrictions and persecution,

00:58:50.476 --> 00:58:52.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they continued to preach

00:58:52.812 --> 00:58:55.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and gather together to worship Jehovah.

00:58:56.883 --> 00:59:01.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When the Witnesses 
‎gained legal recognition in 1974,

00:59:01.321 --> 00:59:06.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
