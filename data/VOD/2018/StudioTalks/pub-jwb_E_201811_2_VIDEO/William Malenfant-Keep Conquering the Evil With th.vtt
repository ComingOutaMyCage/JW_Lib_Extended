‎And that is also the theme 
‎for this month’s program:

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎“Keep Conquering the Evil With the Good.” 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.062 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎This challenging exhortation

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:16.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was written by the apostle Paul 
‎at Romans 12:21. 

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s challenging 
‎because we live in a world

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that is alienated 
‎from God and the truth,

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a world that tries 
‎to squeeze everyone into its mold. 

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Isaiah 5:20 shows how the world

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:34.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎has changed God-given standards. 

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It reads:

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Woe to those who say 
‎that good is bad

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:42.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and bad is good,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“those who substitute darkness for light

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and light for darkness,

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“those who put bitter for sweet

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and sweet for bitter!”

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎By adhering to the standard

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“of healthful words” in the Scriptures

00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and to the examples 
‎of faithful servants of the past,

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we can ‘conquer the evil with the good.’

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:09.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The faithful man Enoch was born

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when Adam 
‎was about 600 years old,

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎which means 
‎that Enoch and Adam

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were contemporaries
‎for about 300 years. 

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:20.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, there is no record

00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of any contact between them
‎during that period of time. 

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:29.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Scriptures indicate 
‎that violence and hate for God

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:32.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were widespread 
‎in that pre-Flood world.

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Many centuries later,

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:39.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the disciple Jude described
‎the fear-inspiring prophecy

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that God gave to Enoch

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:44.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about Jehovah coming
‎with his holy myriads,

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎legions of mighty angels in battle array,

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to bring destruction to all the ungodly.

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Enoch fearlessly went about declaring

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:58.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the coming judgment and destruction and,

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what is more, he did it alone!

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The prophecy was fulfilled
‎in the global Deluge,

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and it set the pattern

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:12.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of a greater destruction yet to come.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎No wonder that Genesis 5:24 tells us

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that “Enoch kept walking
‎with the true God.” 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Enoch’s example gives us courage

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to remain firm for true worship

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even if family and friends
‎stand apart from us. 

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Enoch did not try to fit in
‎with the evil crowd

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the pre-Flood world,

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:38.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we don’t want to fit in

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:42.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with the present dying world
‎and its evil ways. 

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:44.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We may feel alone at times,

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:49.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but we are reminded 
‎that Jehovah never abandoned Enoch,

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and neither will He abandon
‎His faithful servants today. 

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We imitate Enoch

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by not allowing 
‎the evil surrounding us

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:03.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to undermine our faith in Jehovah. 

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:08.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Like Enoch, we can 
‎‘conquer the evil with the good’

00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:11.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by avoiding bad associations,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎sticking close to Jehovah God

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the earthly part of his organization,

00:03:16.012 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and boldly proclaiming the good news.

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:23.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Elisha the prophet

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎refused to engage in ‘paying evil for evil,’

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even when it seemed justified. 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The account is found

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at 2 Kings 6:14-23.

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Syria was at war with Israel.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The king of Syria was enraged

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because Elisha 
‎was able to foresee wherever it was

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Syria was planning 
‎to ambush the Israelites.

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Elisha would warn 
‎the king of Israel, and he, in turn,

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would keep his troops away
‎from the place of ambush. 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The king of Syria became exasperated

00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and wanted desperately 
‎to take the prophet Elisha captive

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to stop him 
‎from warning the king of Israel.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It came about 
‎that the king of Syria learned

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Elisha was in the city of Dothan,

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so the king sent horses,

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎war chariots, as well as a large army

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to surround Dothan by night

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:28.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in order to take Elisha captive.

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The following morning,

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:33.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah listened to Elisha

00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:36.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and did something amazing.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He struck the Syrian troops

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with a temporary form of blindness,

00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:44.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Elisha guided all those troops,

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎not back to Syria, but to Samaria,

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:50.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where the king of Israel resided.

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The king of Israel was anxious

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to strike down and kill the Syrian troops,

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but Elisha said to him,

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as recorded in verses 22 and 23

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of 2 Kings chapter 6:

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘You must not strike them down.

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘Do you strike down 
‎those whom you have taken captive

00:05:11.127 --> 00:05:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘with your sword and with your bow?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘Give them bread and water 
‎so they may eat and drink

‎“and return to their lord.’

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:22.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“So he spread a great feast for them,

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and they ate and drank,

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎after which he sent them away
‎to return to their lord.” 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What a shock this must have been
‎to the Syrian soldiers,

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who likely thought 
‎that they were as good as dead!

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This astounding turn of events

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was far better than ‘paying evil for evil.’

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:46.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How do we know it was better?

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The latter part of verse 23 says:

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“And not once did the marauder bands

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the Syrians come again
‎into the land of Israel.”

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Can you imagine 
‎the men of the Syrian army

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:03.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎relating to their king 
‎what had taken place?

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:06.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They went out to take Elisha captive.

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎However, Elisha, 
‎with the help of Jehovah’s spirit,

00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎had taken 
‎the Syrians captive without a battle.

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:17.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Syrian king 
‎must have been dumbfounded

00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when he heard the report.

00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And you can be sure
‎that the soldiers 

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:24.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the Syrian army 
‎were not only grateful

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:28.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but they acquired 
‎a very respectful fear of Jehovah

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:31.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and of his prophet Elisha. 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The good done to the Syrians

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would not be soon forgotten.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Like Elisha,

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we want to do 
‎what is good for people,

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎including those 
‎who do not view us favorably.

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When tragedies such as fires, floods,

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎earthquakes, and hurricanes strike,

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we go out of our way

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:56.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to comfort people with the Scriptures.

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Also, Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎serving as relief workers are well-known

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for the practical assistance they render

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:05.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to fellow believers and to others.

00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As a result, many people 
‎have changed their view of us

00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:14.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and have come to appreciate
‎that in these last days,

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah does indeed have
‎“a people for his name” on the earth.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At 2 Timothy 2:23-25,

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the apostle Paul encourages us

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to display qualities 
‎that make us different from the world. 

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He says:

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Further, reject foolish
‎and ignorant debates,

00:08:31.227 --> 00:08:35.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎However, the Jewish religious leaders

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When Jesus was on trial,

00:12:27.263 --> 00:12:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎to cry out for his execution.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Roman authorities

‎to suffer a cruel and excruciating death.

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:43.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎While suffering on the torture stake,

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:46.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what did Jesus speak about?

00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:48.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎Among Jesus’ last words

00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are those recorded at Luke 23:34:

00:13:03.933 --> 00:13:06.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Father, forgive them,

00:13:10.172 --> 00:13:13.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎and did not know

00:13:18.347 --> 00:13:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He could forgive them with the hope

‎that they would eventually respond

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:26.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎“Return evil for evil to no one.

00:14:17.373 --> 00:14:20.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Heeding this counsel 
‎is particularly important

00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:23.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in homes that are religiously divided.

00:14:23.846 --> 00:14:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎On the contrary, such an attitude

00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:42.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah’s people 
‎have often overcome prejudice

00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by providing practical assistance

00:15:26.742 --> 00:15:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and particularly when a disaster strikes.

00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:33.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We conscientiously adhere

00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to Romans 12:19, which states:

00:15:37.052 --> 00:15:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,

00:15:40.656 --> 00:15:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“but yield place to the wrath;
‎for it is written:

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘“Vengeance is mine;

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I will repay,” says Jehovah.’”

00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:54.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The footnote on verse 19 shows

00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:58.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Paul is telling us 
‎to yield to “God’s wrath,” or anger.

00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah is the one 
‎who will set matters straight,

00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:06.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he will do it 
‎much better than we ever could.

00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:09.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As James 1:20 states:

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:14.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Man’s anger 
‎does not bring about God’s righteousness.”

00:16:15.324 --> 00:16:17.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The theme of this discussion

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:19.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is summarized exquisitely

00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:23.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at Romans 12:20, 21

00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:27.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with this direction 
‎to all of Jehovah’s people:

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“But ‘if your enemy is hungry, feed him;

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:36.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘if he is thirsty, 
‎give him something to drink;

00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:41.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“for by doing this 
‎you will heap fiery coals on his head.’

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,

00:16:46.488 --> 00:16:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but keep conquering the evil with the good.”
