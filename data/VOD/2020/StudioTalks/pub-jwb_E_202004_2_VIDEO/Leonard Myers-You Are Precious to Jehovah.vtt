Our theme for this month’s program is

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“You Are Precious to Jehovah.”

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How vital it is

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.728 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we remind ourselves of that!

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider three reasons.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Satan wants us to believe

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah doesn’t love us
or value our service.

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted Job to believe that.

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was a lie in Job’s day,
and it’s still a lie today.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second reason that we need
to be reminded that we’re precious to Jehovah

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of negative circumstances

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or events that have taken place in our life.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:46.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Severe illness,
advancing years, injustices,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mistreatment,
a difficult family life, or other situations

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:56.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause some brothers and sisters
to feel that they’re just not worth loving.

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may question why Jehovah
allows those things to happen.

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we need reminders
of how Jehovah feels about us

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our imperfection
can cause us to have negative thoughts.

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may still punish
themselves for past mistakes,

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:17.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he could ever love them.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others wage a constant battle
against feelings of worthlessness.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness wrote:

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Satan has done an excellent job of making

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:35.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even those who love Jehovah
feel worthless and unlovable.

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . I never felt worthy of Jehovah’s love,

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so I tried to do
more and more in his service

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as a way of earning that love.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:46.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . So no matter
how many hours I spent in the ministry,

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or how many people I helped,
I felt it was not enough.

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw only the lack in me.”

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother stated:

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I came from a family
that showed little love.

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was belittled, teased, and laughed at.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, early in life I felt worthless.

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I still carry
entrenched feelings from my past

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:15.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that beat me down
when I experience calamity.

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I stopped serving
as a congregation elder,

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:21.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt like a failure as usual

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to God, my family,
and my brothers in the congregation.”

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve experienced such feelings,

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not alone.

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can you
be assured of Jehovah’s interest?

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:38.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine three lines of evidence

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prove you’re precious to Jehovah.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll examine
Jehovah’s feelings for the nation of Israel.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we’ll reflect
on an event recorded in the Gospels.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third,
we’ll consider a modern-day example

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:58.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who was very precious to God.

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:03.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of the 16th century B.C.E.,

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:05.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of Israelites
were enslaved in Egypt,

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were severely oppressed.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their distress,
the Israelites cried out to Jehovah.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:15.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he feel?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to Isaiah 63:9.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>A</i> portion reads:

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During all their distress

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was distressing to him.”

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did Jehovah see their troubles

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he felt for his people,

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was moved to act in their behalf.

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 63:9 goes on to say:

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In his love and compassion
he repurchased them.”

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah couldn’t see
their suffering or hear their outcries

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without feeling for them
and doing something about it.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may remind us of the loving concern

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a mother has for her newborn child.

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that baby cries,

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mother takes notice

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:06.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she feels for her child.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, notice how
this is expressed at Isaiah 49:15.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can a woman forget her nursing child

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or have no compassion
for the son of her womb?

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if these women forget,

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never forget you.”

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:33.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to imagine a mother forgetting
to nourish and care for her nursing child.

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That baby is helpless

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—day and night
it needs its mother’s attention.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sad to say, however,

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:44.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we hear at times
of such maternal neglect.

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did Jehovah say
to reassure the Israelites?

00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I would never forget you.”

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the tender compassion
that Jehovah felt for his servants

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was immeasurably stronger

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:03.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than one of the most tender
and natural feelings we can imagine

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the compassion
a mother normally feels for her baby.

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s feelings for the Israelites

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:13.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are summed up
in another expression in the book of Isaiah.

00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me Isaiah 43:4:

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For you became precious in my eyes,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were honored, and I have loved you.”

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:31.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah clearly expressed
his feelings for his people.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:35.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one of Jehovah’s servants,

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can be sure
that he also loves you most tenderly.

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what trials you’re facing now
or have endured in the past,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re far too precious to Jehovah
for him to forget you.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers your past efforts,

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sees
your continuing efforts to please him.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jehovah promises
to sustain and comfort his people

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:11.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Isaiah 66:12, 13:

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will nurse and be carried on the hip,

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will be bounced on the knees.

00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:21.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a mother comforts her son,

00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I will keep comforting you.”

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:28.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a heartwarming scene!

00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a loving mother
carrying a baby on her hip

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bouncing him on her knees.

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:36.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tenderness of his love for you.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah loved his people, Israel,

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he likewise feels that you
are very precious and dear

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never doubt that!

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second example
of how Jehovah feels

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his faithful servants
can be found in the Gospels.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what happened on one occasion

00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem

00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:09.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:1-4:

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now as he looked up,

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw the rich dropping their gifts

00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:16.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into the treasury chests.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he saw a needy widow drop in

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two small coins of very little value,

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he said:

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Truly I say to you that this poor widow

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘put in more than they all did.

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For all of these put in gifts

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘out of their surplus,

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but she, out of her want

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[or as the footnote says, “poverty”],

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:45.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put in all the means of living she had.’”

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:47.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note for verse 2

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures</i>

00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:53.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that the Greek word
for “needy” may describe

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a person who lacks
the basic necessities of life

00:07:57.193 --> 00:08:00.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or someone for whom
life is a great struggle.

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:04.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Christian Greek Scriptures,
it is used only here.”

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about the widow’s circumstances.

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:11.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only had she experienced the grief

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:13.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of losing her husband, her provider,

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she also lived in a religious climate

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dominated by leaders who,

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Luke 20:47,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would “devour the houses of the widows”

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than help such vulnerable ones.

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That widow was so poor
that her contribution to the temple

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was what a laborer
might earn in just a few minutes.

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life wasn’t easy for her.

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Jesus said that she

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:45.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put in all the means of living she had.”

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications have stated
that the coins the widow contributed

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were likely two lepta.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eight lepta,
a person could buy two sparrows,

00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:01.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which were among the cheapest birds
used for food.

00:09:01.324 --> 00:09:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the widow had
only half the amount needed

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to buy one sparrow,

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hardly enough for a single meal.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, both the widow and her contribution

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:15.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were valuable to Jehovah.

00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that her contribution was greater

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the contributions of the rich.

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she put those two small coins
in the treasury chest,

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would be mixed
with what the rich had put in.

00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To imperfect human eyes,
they might seem lost, buried.

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, this precious widow
was the one Jesus singled out for praise.

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the treasury workers
came across the coins,

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they wouldn’t have known
how precious the coins and their donor

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were to Jehovah.

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s view
was the one that really mattered,

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not what other people thought

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even how that dear widow viewed herself.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like that widow,

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may find that circumstances limit

00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you can contribute to Jehovah.

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:06.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Age, infirmities,
or other circumstances beyond your control

00:10:06.289 --> 00:10:10.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may limit the amount of time
you’re able to spend in the ministry.

00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might feel
that your efforts are like those

00:10:13.396 --> 00:10:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two small coins of very little value.”

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we learn from this account
of the needy widow

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah notices
and he treasures each act done for him,

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when we do it
despite difficult circumstances.

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a moment, think back on your worship
of Jehovah during the past year.

00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:41.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you may feel
that you accomplished little.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your imperfect heart
might cause you to wonder

00:10:43.592 --> 00:10:47.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Jehovah
was pleased with your efforts.

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, did one of the hours you spent

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
require a special sacrifice on your part?

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah took notice of the widow

00:10:56.639 --> 00:11:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dropping in those two coins
and valued her contribution,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you think he also noticed

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and valued what you did
for him during that hour?

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah values every gift,
no matter how small,

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that springs from a heart motivated by love.

00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:17.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers, and he’ll reward

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the smallest contribution
given in support of his Kingdom.

00:11:22.198 --> 00:11:25.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s proof of how Jehovah feels about you.

00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s consider a modern-day example

00:11:30.573 --> 00:11:34.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who was very precious to Jehovah.

00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:37.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the experience of Sister Areti Pina.

00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:40.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina lived
on the southern coast of Albania

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:42.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the town of Vlorë.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was baptized in 1928 at the age of 18.

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a strong congregation 
in Vlorë in the 1930’s,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer

00:11:53.996 --> 00:11:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who climbed up and down rugged mountains,

00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching with her Bible in hand.

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, a congregation
no longer existed in Vlorë,

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:06.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sister Pina lost contact
with the brothers.

00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:10.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, she kept preaching faithfully
on her own.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:14.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think her efforts
went unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, years later, word reached the brothers

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was an old, senile woman

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was reportedly preaching in Vlorë.

00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:25.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People thought she was crazy
for keeping faith in God

00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during years of totalitarian rule.

00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Sister Pina, now in her 80’s,
was anything but senile.

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the brothers arrived at her home,

00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:39.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina invited them in,

00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she seemed somewhat reserved.

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they explained
that they were her spiritual brothers,

00:12:45.548 --> 00:12:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had no reaction.

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a few minutes,

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:53.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina started firing
questions at the brothers:

00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:57.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe in the Trinity?
What is God’s name?

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:00.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe in hellfire?
What happens when we die?

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the earth?
How many go to heaven?”

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers answered each question.

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you preach?” she then asked.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes,” said one brother, “we preach.”

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But,” she responded, 
“how do you preach?”

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We preach from house to house,”
replied the brother.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that you are my brothers!”
she exclaimed.

00:13:25.788 --> 00:13:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only Jehovah’s people
preach from house to house!”

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:33.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through her tears, Sister Pina stated:

00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is wonderful.
He never forgot me!”

00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:44.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometime later, the brothers
were notified that Sister Pina was ill

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:47.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she wanted to meet
with one of the responsible brothers.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he arrived, she asked in part,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as she gasped for air,

00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Has the book of Revelation been fulfilled?”

00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother responded,
“Yes, Areti, most of it has.”

00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:06.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina said:
“Now I can die in peace.

00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:10.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to know how close we are.”

00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after that conversation,

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina
faithfully finished her earthly course.

00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During all those years of isolation

00:14:22.311 --> 00:14:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did Sister Pina’s efforts
go unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:31.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not!

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine Jehovah’s joy

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:38.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched her faithfully doing
what she could in his service.

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:42.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Sister Pina
was precious to Jehovah?

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt she was.

00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your efforts in Jehovah’s service
do not go unnoticed by him either.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him.

00:14:57.012 --> 00:15:00.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what has this consideration
helped us to realize?

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have to contend with Satan’s lies,

00:15:03.686 --> 00:15:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
negative circumstances
and events in our lives,

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:09.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our own imperfections.

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:14.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we should never forget
that Jehovah highly values his servants.

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:19.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that in his words to the Israelites
through the prophet Isaiah.

00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:24.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be sure that Jehovah
loves you most tenderly.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what trials you’re facing now
or have endured in the past,

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:32.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:35.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:15:35.484 --> 00:15:39.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re far too precious to Jehovah
for him to forget you.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account of the widow in Luke chapter 21

00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:46.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can assure you that although circumstances

00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may affect what you
can contribute to Jehovah,

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he notices and treasures
each act you do for him,

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:58.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you do it
in the face of difficult circumstances.

00:15:58.807 --> 00:16:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers,
and he will reward

00:16:01.443 --> 00:16:05.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the smallest contribution
given in support of his Kingdom.

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what beautiful modern-day examples
we have in the organization

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters
who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah

00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:19.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are precious to him,
like the example of Sister Pina!

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:23.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters, please,

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:27.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget that you
are precious to Jehovah!
