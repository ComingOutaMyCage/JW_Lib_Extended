Hello, everyone!

00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:06.089 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I bring you warm greetings

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from the Governing Body

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:10.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the United States Bethel family.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to know
that we love you all very much,

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re concerned about you,

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray for you each and every day.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that more and more
of you are being affected

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the coronavirus pandemic.

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t go to work.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t go to school.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:32.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t go to the Kingdom Hall
or preach from house to house.

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you have lost your jobs,

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:39.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have no idea how
you are going to be able to feed your family.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:42.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others have family members who live far away.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no one else in the house.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re worried about them.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:50.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sadly, some are mourning
the loss of loved ones

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been victims of the disease.

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:56.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to know
that our hearts ache for you.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so sorry for your loss.

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:02.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these are very stressful times,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s important to remember one thing:

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No friend of Jehovah

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is ever truly alone.

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:16.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through his holy spirit, Jehovah can help us;

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can sustain us
even if there’s no one else in the house.

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way Jehovah is helping us

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by means of caring shepherds.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is in line
with the promise that he himself made.

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read Jeremiah 23:4,

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll see how this prophecy
is being fulfilled today.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just going to read a part of it.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the promise Jehovah made:

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was
going to “raise up . . . shepherds 

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will really shepherd them.”

00:01:47.957 --> 00:01:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then at the end it says:

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“None [of them] will be missing.”

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, can you see how that promise

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being fulfilled today in the elders?

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think of all the work
our elders are doing

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure that we don’t miss out
on spiritual food, for example.

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are arranging for us
to tie in to congregation meetings,

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:13.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they set up shepherding calls
using videoconferencing,

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:15.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they arrange for meetings for field service,

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they make sure
we have telephone territory

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and letter-writing territory.

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:22.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, these shepherds

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also concerned
about your physical well-being.

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:28.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from time to time,
they may also check in on us

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure that we have basic food items,

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
medications, and other necessary things.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they do that, don’t be shy:

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the elders know your needs.

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:44.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may also provide practical suggestions
on how you can protect your health.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you can imagine,
when the pandemic broke out,

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders had a lot of questions.

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d never dealt with this before.

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And suddenly, they needed to do all kinds
of things that they hadn’t done before:

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set up videoconferencing accounts,

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn how to use new apps like Skype®

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:05.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zoom—what’s that?—

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:07.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become familiar with how 

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:11.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to organize
an entire congregation meeting online.

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a huge task for our brothers,

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to commend them
for the excellent job they’re doing.

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:24.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders had a lot of questions,
but through his organization,

00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:27.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided the direction they needed.

00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:31.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And an experience
from Canada will bring this out.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a video
in which Brother Warren Shewfelt,

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Canada Branch Committee,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains what happened in Canada.

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.507 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the face of the coronavirus threat,

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:46.976 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a body of elders near the Canada branch

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
recently met to determine

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:51.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to go forward with congregation meetings.

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had so many questions 

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how to balance
the spiritual needs of the brothers

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:59.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with government regulations on gatherings.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They prayed to Jehovah for guidance.

00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as their meeting went on,

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it still wasn’t clear to them how to proceed.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one of the brothers
noticed on his electronic device

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a letter from the branch
with instructions to the elders.

00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:17.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they read through it,
it answered all their questions

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:20.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even some they hadn’t anticipated.

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They viewed this
as Jehovah’s answer to their prayers,

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now they had
less than 24 hours to prepare 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their first-ever congregation meeting
by videoconference.

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:35.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayerfully, they followed
the instructions step-by-step,

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:39.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the next evening,
the whole congregation gathered

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a meeting by videoconference.

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The attendance was well over 100 percent,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one of the families who were 
in attendance wrote to the elders:

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:53.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are so grateful for all the effort 

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to provide this
much needed spiritual food live.

00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:00.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was exactly what we needed.

00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:02.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.”

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:07.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging experience that was!

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Warren.
We really appreciate it.

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:13.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, it reminds me
of what the prophet Isaiah foretold

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 65:24:

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even before they call . . . , I will answer; 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while they are yet speaking, I will hear.”

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think of caring elders,
our circuit overseers come to mind

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’re often a vital link
between the branch

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the congregation when disaster strikes.

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:41.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That reminds me of an experience
my wife and I had back in 2010.

00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:44.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to do
a shepherding visit to Haiti

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 10 days after a tremendous earthquake

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took hundreds of thousands of lives.

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sadly, 154 of our brothers
also lost their lives.

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I met with the traveling overseers
in the country,

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I learned that some of them
had lost members of their own family.

00:06:04.313 --> 00:06:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they were at the forefront
of the rescue effort,

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:10.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they hadn’t had time
to mourn their own loss.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were still looking
for survivors of the quake.

00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jehovah say?

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will raise up . . .
shepherds who will really shepherd them.

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:22.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None [of them] will be missing.”

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those shepherds in Haiti
were going to make sure

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that none of their brothers
and sisters were missing.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know that our fine traveling overseers

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are continuing to serve congregations

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as best they can during this pandemic?

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that possible?

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this encouraging video report,
Brother Paul Echon,

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is a member
of the Philippines Branch Committee,

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:51.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells how even remote congregations
are being cared for.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is interesting.

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:54.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.068 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A circuit overseer in the Philippines

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:01.137 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wrote regarding his experience

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:03.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
using the videoconferencing app Zoom

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit two
of the remotest congregations in his circuit.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normal travel to these islands by small boat

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may take between five to eight hours,

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:17.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depending on sea conditions
and the size of waves from the Pacific Ocean.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
travel restrictions to Patnanungan

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jomalig islands were implemented.

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:27.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circuit overseer and his wife

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:29.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayed fervently to Jehovah,

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking for a possible means
to still visit the congregations

the last two weeks of March.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:38.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just days later, they received
a letter from the branch office

00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about alternative ways
of making congregation visits.

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:46.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This included
the possibility of virtual visits

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:49.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the use of online conferencing tools.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circuit overseer
immediately informed the elders,

00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:56.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they excitedly tested
their newfound means of communication.

00:07:56.826 --> 00:07:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The visits were a success!

00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:01.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters were so thankful

00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really felt Jehovah’s love for them.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:08.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on his experience,
the circuit overseer said:

00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is obvious that no coronavirus

00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:14.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can prevent our Almighty God, Jehovah,

00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:17.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from providing encouragement
to his servants today.

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are determined more than ever
to help and encourage 

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the brothers to continue trusting
in Jehovah completely,

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:27.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as mentioned at Psalm 91:2, which says:

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You are my refuge and my stronghold.’”

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we read at Jeremiah 23:4?

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“None [of them] will be missing.”

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows where all his sheep are,

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:45.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he arranges for them to be cared for.

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Paul.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please give our warm love and greetings

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:50.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in the Philippines.

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love them all very much.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we want to take away
from this brief discussion?

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:03.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two points: First, we believe that Jehovah

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue to guide his organization
every step of the way.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s been faith-strengthening
to see how, at times,

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organization has been
one or even two steps ahead

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the authorities
in giving direction to protect the flock.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first point:

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:22.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will continue
to direct the organization.

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, what is one of the means
by which he will do that?

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:31.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By providing loving shepherds
to carry out that direction.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And over them is the One who said:

00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am the fine shepherd;

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:39.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the fine shepherd surrenders his life

00:09:39.428 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in behalf of the sheep.”

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:46.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
take good care of yourselves.

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t take chances.

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:52.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obey the instructions
of “the superior authorities.”

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We at Bethel are extremely conscientious

00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about following
the guidelines we’ve received.

00:09:57.647 --> 00:10:02.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if the authorities tell you
to stay home, stay home.

00:10:02.418 --> 00:10:05.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Practice social distancing.

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:09.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep up-to-date with the news,
but don’t obsess.

00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:10.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t watch it too much.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be just too discouraging.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what season are we in?

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Memorial season.

00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what should be the real focus
of our thoughts at this time?

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:27.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The incredible gift of the ransom,

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love of Jehovah God,
the love of Christ Jesus.

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:33.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those things should be
the object of our thoughts.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you feel alone or stressed-out,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
repeat to yourself the heart-cheering words

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we find at Hebrews 13:5:

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will never leave you,

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will never abandon you.”

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:52.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will never leave you,

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:56.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will never abandon you.”

00:10:57.306 --> 00:11:02.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured of our warm love and prayers.

00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
