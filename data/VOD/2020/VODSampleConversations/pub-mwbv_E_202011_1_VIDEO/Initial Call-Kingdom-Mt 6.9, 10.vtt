A lot of people are thinking
about government these days.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so right.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:14.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which side are you on?

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, I’m neutral
when it comes to politics.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, I support God’s government.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s government?

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Millions of people pray for God’s government.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many just don’t even realize it.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to show you what I’m talking about.

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s here at Matthew 6:9, 10:

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must pray, then, this way:

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Our Father in the heavens,
let your name be sanctified.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let your Kingdom come.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let your will take place, as in heaven,
also on earth.’”

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you heard these words before?

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, my wife says them all the time.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are people praying for?

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:57.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the beginning of verse 10?

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your Kingdom come.”

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, a kingdom is a type of government.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:07.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was teaching people
to pray for God’s government to come.

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:08.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:09.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never made that connection.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d read it,
I’d like to leave this magazine with you.

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s entitled “What Is God’s Kingdom?”

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the next time,
we can discuss the question,

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will God’s Kingdom accomplish?

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
