00:00:09 A lot of people are thinking about government these days.
00:00:11 You’re so right.
00:00:13 Which side are you on?
00:00:14 Actually, I’m neutral when it comes to politics.
00:00:17 Instead, I support God’s government.
00:00:19 God’s government?
00:00:26 Yeah.
00:00:27 Millions of people pray for God’s government.
00:00:29 Many just don’t even realize it.
00:00:31 I’d like to show you what I’m talking about.
00:00:33 It’s here at Matthew 6:9, 10:
00:00:38 “You must pray, then, this way:
00:00:40 “‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.
00:00:43 “‘Let your Kingdom come.
00:00:45 Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.’”
00:00:49 Have you heard these words before?
00:00:51 Yeah, my wife says them all the time.
00:00:52 So, what are people praying for?
00:00:55 Did you notice the beginning of verse 10?
00:00:57 “Let your Kingdom come.”
00:00:59 Yes, a kingdom is a type of government.
00:01:03 Jesus was teaching people to pray for God’s government to come.
00:01:07 Hmm.
00:01:08 I never made that connection.
00:01:09 If you’d read it, I’d like to leave this magazine with you.
00:01:12 It’s entitled “What Is God’s Kingdom?”
00:01:15 Then the next time, we can discuss the question,
00:01:17 What will God’s Kingdom accomplish?
00:01:20 OK.
