We extend a warm welcome to all of you!

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the January 2020 edition

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Excitement was in the air

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:35.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as brothers and sisters

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from around the world

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:39.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
poured into the Assembly Hall

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:41.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Newburgh, New York,

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:46.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the annual meeting on October 5, 2019.

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:51.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encouraging reports
and thrilling announcements

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave clear evidence of Jehovah’s blessing

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:56.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the preaching work.

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:59.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you will hear it for yourself.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the first part

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 2019 annual meeting.

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:10.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve chosen the theme

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your Leader Is One, the Christ,”

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:18.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on Matthew 23:10.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting out with Nimrod of Babylon,

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world has seen many leaders

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—religious leaders, political leaders.

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Hitler ruled Nazi Germany,

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Nazis created a slogan:

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One people, one empire, one leader.”

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened to that leader?

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After causing the death of millions
during World War II,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reportedly ended his life by suicide.

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:49.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Human leaders have failed.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one, most did not have
enough love for God and for the people.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They used their position
to acquire wealth, fame, power.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others might have had
noble intentions but still failed.

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:08.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imperfect man does not have the ability

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rule, or lead, others perfectly.

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible times, Jehovah was the leader
of the ancient people of Israel.

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:20.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, according to Leviticus 11:45:

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am Jehovah,
who is leading you

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:29.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up out of the land of Egypt
to prove myself God to you.”

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jehovah appointed Moses
as a visible leader representing Him,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although he was imperfect.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:41.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, he appointed Joshua,
then the judges, then the kings.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the people
sometimes rejected their leadership.

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, a leader exists
whose leadership is perfect

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus Christ.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was appointed by Jehovah.

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a leader who is sinless

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:01.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—different from any other human.

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s perfect in wisdom and in righteousness.

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:08.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s more powerful
than all human leaders together.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s also perfect in love.

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is a leader
that gave his life for the people.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we all appreciate his leadership?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure we do.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:26.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus provided leadership by personal example

00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:29.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the same time
showed humility in dealing with others.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed love for his disciples
throughout the centuries until today,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthening them when persecuted.

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never abandoned them,

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he also indicated at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:49.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to follow his lead?

00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:51.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trust you do.

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century,
at Pentecost 33 C.E.,

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christian congregation was formed.

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a governing body
of mature Christians, namely, the apostles,

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were responsible to take the lead.

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When some of them were killed
or died of sickness or old age,

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:13.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other anointed ones
were appointed to serve on that body.

00:04:13.703 --> 00:04:15.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly today,

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no specific number
on the modern-day Governing Body.

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:22.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century, the governing body

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not only led by the spirit

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:29.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in matters of doctrine, even inspired.

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:31.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, it’s not inspired

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still led by the spirit.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, our recognizing
Christ’s leadership involves

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:42.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
submission to and cooperation
with his spiritual brothers

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with other appointed overseers.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Brother Russell,

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford
became the president of the Society,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our human leader at that time.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whereas at the beginning of his presidency

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he strongly emphasized his position,

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:03.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he changed his attitude later,

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
realizing he was not to be considered

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number one,
or the leader.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>
<i>—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom </i>

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says on pages 220-221:

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At a convention
in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1941,

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“shortly before his death,

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he spoke about the matter
of leadership, saying:

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I want to let any strangers here know

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘what you think
about a man being your leader,

00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:36.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so they won’t be forgetting.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘. . . If there is any person
in this audience

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:41.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who thinks that I,
this man standing here,

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the leader of Jehovah’s witnesses,
say Yes.’

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The response was an impressive silence,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“broken only by an emphatic ‘No’

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from several in the audience.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The speaker continued:

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If you who are here believe that I am
just one of the servants of the Lord,

00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and we are working
shoulder to shoulder in unity,

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“serving God and serving Christ,
say Yes.’

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[And] in unison the assembly

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:16.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
roared out a decisive ‘Yes!’”

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From January 1942 to June 1977,

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Nathan Homer Knorr
served as president of the Society.

00:06:26.602 --> 00:06:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, by divine influence,

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authority was shifted more and more

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:34.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the president to a Governing Body

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the meaning
of the term and the function

00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:39.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was understood increasingly better.

00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jesus is still the Leader,

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing leadership for the congregations.

00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also directs
the worldwide preaching work from heaven.

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he has delegated leadership

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:56.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “the faithful and discreet slave”
—the Governing Body—

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through whom he provides
spiritual food at the proper time

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in line with Matthew 24:45-47.

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No member of the Governing Body
has the title “Leader,”

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:12.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since Jesus said that none of his disciples

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be called Leader

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:18.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 23:10-12.

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The term “governing body”
was used by us for the first time

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in <i>The Watchtower </i> of 1944,

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
November 1, page 328,

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the article
“Theocratic Organization in Action.”

00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But de facto in 1944,
there was no Governing Body

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with collective decision-making
in operation yet.

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:47.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A historic change came
on September 6, 1971.

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:50.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was resolved that the chairmanship
of the Governing Body

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would rotate annually among its members,

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing so alphabetically.

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On October 1, 1971,

00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Frederick William Franz

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became the chairman
of the Governing Body for one year,

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:07.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the <i>Proclaimers </i> book,

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 106-107.

00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:13.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting in 1971,

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of the members
of the Governing Body was raised.

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:18.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, there were 18 members.

00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:20.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Governing Body was formed,

00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:23.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was put in writing that all members

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:27.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider themselves as equal to the others;

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none were more equal than the others.

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was the number one among the 12 apostles?

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, none of them.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:42.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 21:14 says

00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:46.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in a figurative description

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:50.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the New Jerusalem
—Messianic Kingdom—

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there will be “12 apostles of the Lamb,”

00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:58.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no apostle is shown in this text

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being superior to another.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:05.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body also appoints

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:08.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helpers to assist them;

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:11.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was instituted in 1992.

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:16.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of the Governing Body
committees has helpers;

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:20.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are over 30 helpers now.

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:22.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They participate at the meetings

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:26.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body committee
to which they are assigned.

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not share in decision-making

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:33.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but are offering
observations and suggestions.

00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also they carry out the decisions made

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the respective Governing Body committee.

00:09:40.196 --> 00:09:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body also appoints

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branch Committees and Country Committees

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in different parts of the world,

00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:51.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have oversight
over one or more countries.

00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:54.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, who is the number one
on the Branch Committee?

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:58.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one.

00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:00.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christ is number one.

00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branch Committees also have a chairman

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:06.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who rotates each year alphabetically.

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is in place since 1976.

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:15.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairman of the U.S. branch
starting this coming January

00:10:15.097 --> 00:10:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Brother Lon Schilling.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is the leader
among congregation elders?

00:10:22.405 --> 00:10:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although all of them are to take the lead,

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of them
is to be considered number one.

00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:31.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no rotation in place.

00:10:31.514 --> 00:10:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a sense, we could say
that Jesus is number one, or the Leader.

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:39.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the head of the congregation.

00:10:39.488 --> 00:10:43.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The coordinators
of the body of elders do not rotate,

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:47.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they are aware
that all elders are equals.

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:49.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None are more equal than the others.

00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:56.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is Christ’s leadership real to you?

00:10:56.138 --> 00:10:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not following a man.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be determined to study more

00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our Leader,

00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:08.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imitating him in our personal lives.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will love you

00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you follow his appointed Leader now,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you do,
you may get the privilege to follow him

00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forever after into all eternity.

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:30.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now have the privilege

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:34.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hear from Brother Stephen Lett
of the Governing Body.

00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:37.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will address the subject

00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our Relief Ministry,
Used by Jehovah to Provide Relief.”

00:11:51.327 --> 00:11:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a wonderful God

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of comfort and relief.

00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In stark contrast,

00:12:00.603 --> 00:12:03.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil is a horrible god

00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:05.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of pain and suffering.

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if we think about it,

00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:12.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even with the so-called natural disasters

00:12:12.047 --> 00:12:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cause a lot of pain and suffering,

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is the ultimate cause.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by alienating humans from Jehovah,

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:26.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan deprived them of the Creator

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lovingly controlling
the weather for their benefit.

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:33.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, humans under Satan’s rule

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have grossly mismanaged the earth

00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:38.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its environmental provisions,

00:12:38.607 --> 00:12:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resulting in erratic weather swings

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:46.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which undoubtedly contribute
to these so-called natural disasters.

00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:49.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how thankful, as we said,

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is a God of comfort and relief!

00:12:51.887 --> 00:12:55.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one way he lives up to this title

00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:59.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by empowering and motivating us

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:04.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share in a relief ministry
in behalf of our brothers

00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been pummeled
by some catastrophe.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we allow Jehovah
to use us in this way,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re actually imitating
our first-century brothers and sisters.

00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to Acts 11:29.

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The setting is about the year 46 C.E.,

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers in Judea

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are suffering from a terrible famine.

00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being unable to pay
the sky-high prices for food,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re very hungry;
they’re even facing starvation.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did their brothers in Antioch,

00:13:41.937 --> 00:13:45.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their Jewish and Gentile brothers,

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:47.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do for these brothers in Judea?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read beginning in verse 29:

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:53.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the disciples determined,

00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each according to what he could afford,

00:13:56.352 --> 00:14:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to send relief
to the brothers living in Judea;

00:14:00.523 --> 00:14:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and this they did,

00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sending it to the elders
by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.”

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:09.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can just imagine how appreciative

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:12.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those brothers
facing starvation in Judea were

00:14:12.568 --> 00:14:16.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive this aid
from their brothers in Antioch!

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:19.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can just imagine
how appreciative Jehovah was

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what the ones in Antioch did
for their very needy brothers!

00:14:24.313 --> 00:14:27.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this Bible account is just one of several

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our brothers in one area
performing a relief ministry

00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:36.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in behalf of others
living elsewhere who are very needy.

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we ask this,

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:41.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How specifically does Jehovah provide

00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:45.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comfort and relief
by means of our relief ministry?

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here are three ways.

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, physical relief is given.

00:14:50.673 --> 00:14:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother’s immediate needs
regarding food, clothing, shelter,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
medicine, first-aid supplies are provided.

00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:02.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two, emotional relief is given.

00:15:02.217 --> 00:15:05.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assurance is given that they’re not alone.

00:15:05.087 --> 00:15:07.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with them,

00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their brothers are with them
in this time of distress.

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:14.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most important,
spiritual relief is given.

00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:19.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We make sure that our brothers
have what they need

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resume immediately

00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:26.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their spiritual routine of serving Jehovah.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:31.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, in order to continue
their spiritual routine long-term,

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their lives and their circumstances
have to be stabilized.

00:15:35.317 --> 00:15:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This often requires either repairing

00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:41.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or rebuilding their Kingdom Halls

00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:44.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and repairing or even in many cases

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:46.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rebuilding their homes,

00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:50.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they can continue
in their spiritual routine.

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:53.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, enjoy, please, this video

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:56.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing how our brothers in Indonesia

00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were helped to resume quickly

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their spiritual routine

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:06.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the devastating earthquake
and tsunami of 2018.

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:17.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Four days after the earthquake,
evacuation of 132 people began.

00:16:33.175 --> 00:16:34.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was important

00:16:34.677 --> 00:16:36.679 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to take care of the spiritual needs

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:37.780 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers and sisters

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and, amazingly,

00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:42.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not a single meeting was missed.

00:16:42.317 --> 00:16:44.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several of us from the branch office

00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave encouraging talks
to the publishers there.

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meetings for field service were also held,

00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:51.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the publishers there went out preaching

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a couple of days after they had arrived.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had the opportunity
to go out preaching in Poso.

00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:01.136 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many people were interested in discussing

00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:03.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the events that took place in Palu.

00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:07.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They listened to the Bible’s message
and asked to be visited again.

00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:09.545 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After meeting for field service

00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:11.046 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the Poso Kingdom Hall,

00:17:11.046 --> 00:17:12.214 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we had the opportunity

to play sign-language videos

00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:17.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from jw.org® to several deaf ones.

00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:20.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we were struck

00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:23.192 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by a natural disaster,

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:25.194 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were still able to carry out

00:17:25.194 --> 00:17:26.562 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
spiritual routines.

00:17:26.562 --> 00:17:29.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very grateful to Jehovah,

00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:32.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers from the branch office,
and others whose prayers,

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examples, and presence really helped us

00:17:35.838 --> 00:17:40.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure and to keep on relying
on Jehovah no matter what.

00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:50.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of our relief ministry,

00:17:50.185 --> 00:17:53.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we prove we’re imitators

00:17:53.188 --> 00:17:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the God of comfort and relief

00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we also prove

00:17:57.593 --> 00:17:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re obeying the command

00:17:59.595 --> 00:18:02.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ephesians 5:1, 2, which says:

00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become imitators of God,
as beloved children,

00:18:06.401 --> 00:18:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go on walking in love.”

00:18:10.072 --> 00:18:14.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you think about it,
we’re really created to imitate Jehovah.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re made in his image, aren’t we?

00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:20.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast,
animals cannot imitate Jehovah,

00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:24.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of unselfish love
and comfort and relief.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:27.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
you can’t imagine a dog thinking to himself:

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You know, I really feel bad about taking
that bone away from the other dog.

00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:38.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the future, I’m really going
to try to be more unselfish.’

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t imagine a horse

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:44.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking up at a beautiful sunset:

00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:48.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘My, that sunset
makes me love my Creator more.

00:18:48.744 --> 00:18:51.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to try
to please him more in the future.’

00:18:51.914 --> 00:18:55.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t imagine an eagle praying,

00:18:55.384 --> 00:19:00.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Lord, thank you very much
for the fish I’m about to eat.’

00:19:01.623 --> 00:19:04.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, animals are not made in God’s image
—we are.

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imitate our wonderful God

00:19:07.763 --> 00:19:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of comfort and relief and love.

00:19:10.132 --> 00:19:12.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a question:

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:15.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does our relief ministry glorify Jehovah?

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:18.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here are three ways we’ll discuss.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
It proves that we are true Christians,

00:19:23.145 --> 00:19:25.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that reflects well on our God.

00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:30.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Secondly, it unites us
as brothers and sisters;

00:19:30.652 --> 00:19:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it unites us in love and prayer.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we hear about a disaster

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:37.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affecting our brothers, what do we do?

00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:39.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We start praying for them, don’t we?

00:19:39.728 --> 00:19:42.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then as we start giving them relief,

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they start praying for us

00:19:44.633 --> 00:19:47.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they start working in harmony with us

00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:50.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s the second way
we’re united in activity.

00:19:50.172 --> 00:19:53.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spring into action to help our brothers,

00:19:53.508 --> 00:19:57.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they do what they can
to support our efforts in their behalf.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, please enjoy this video.

00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:04.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Relief workers from the United States,
Indonesia, and Africa

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:08.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spring into action to help their brothers.

00:20:16.865 --> 00:20:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:20.269 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be able to come

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:22.971 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and help rebuild the damaged houses

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:25.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that the brothers

00:20:25.007 --> 00:20:27.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
feel secure living in them.

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:29.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see this as evidence

00:20:29.778 --> 00:20:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have
brotherly love toward one another.

00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:36.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a faith-strengthening event,

00:20:36.518 --> 00:20:40.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just for the families
affected directly by the fire,

00:20:40.889 --> 00:20:43.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for all of us helping out.

00:20:43.358 --> 00:20:46.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had the privilege to watch Jehovah

00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:48.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do so much for his people

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:53.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—physically, emotionally,
spiritually, mentally.

00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:56.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very faith-strengthening to know
that Jehovah never abandons us.

00:21:02.778 --> 00:21:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after the cyclone hit here in Beira,

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.848 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were privileged to be able to come

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:07.950 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
up here and help out.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It felt really good to be there

00:21:10.118 --> 00:21:12.120 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be able to help the brothers

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.457 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to face an extremely difficult situation.

00:21:15.457 --> 00:21:17.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot during this time.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always, always, always

00:21:20.128 --> 00:21:22.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is good for us.

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re actually putting a roof
back on the Kingdom Hall.

00:21:26.268 --> 00:21:28.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was completely destroyed during the storm.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the idea
is that the Memorial is next week;

00:21:30.772 --> 00:21:32.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re going to be able to come
back to their Kingdom Hall,

00:21:32.808 --> 00:21:34.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which will be fixed up,
and celebrate the Memorial.

00:21:34.943 --> 00:21:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re happy to be a part of that.

00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:49.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,

00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:53.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re united in giving contributions.

00:21:53.028 --> 00:21:56.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We give generously

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as cheerful givers.

00:21:58.433 --> 00:22:01.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those who have been helped,
what do they do?

00:22:01.536 --> 00:22:03.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Subsequently, they, in turn,

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:07.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help others who are afflicted
with their contributions.

00:22:07.309 --> 00:22:09.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, here are some statistics

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:15.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the great magnitude
of our relief ministry

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just during the past two service years.

00:22:17.519 --> 00:22:20.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, during these two service years alone,

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:23.091 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more than 900,000 of our brothers

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:25.127 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have been affected

00:22:25.127 --> 00:22:27.462 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—almost a million.

00:22:27.462 --> 00:22:29.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sixty-two thousand of them

00:22:29.464 --> 00:22:31.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were displaced;

00:22:31.466 --> 00:22:33.835 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
190 were injured;

00:22:33.835 --> 00:22:36.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
sadly, 64 were killed;

00:22:36.838 --> 00:22:38.940 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more than 700 Kingdom Halls

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.776 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were damaged or destroyed;

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.778 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more than 15,000 homes

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:44.880 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were damaged or destroyed.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.681 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The organization

00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:50.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
spent $49.5 million (U.S.)

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:52.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on relief efforts

00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:54.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
just during these two service years.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that’s almost $50 million

00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.161 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in just two service years.

00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:02.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, our relief ministry

00:23:02.664 --> 00:23:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has taken on gigantic proportions.

00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help you appreciate
how your donations are being used,

00:23:10.572 --> 00:23:14.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please enjoy this video
showing before and after pictures

00:23:14.843 --> 00:23:16.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of homes of our brothers

00:23:16.845 --> 00:23:21.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after Cyclone Idai struck in Africa.

00:24:16.238 --> 00:24:18.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just for your information,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those homes that were rebuilt
that you saw there,

00:24:21.676 --> 00:24:23.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some were rebuilt and some were repaired.

00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The cost to repair

00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ranged from $50 to $900 per home.

00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:31.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The cost to rebuild

00:24:31.987 --> 00:24:36.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was from $900 to $3,500
for each home.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:41.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you saw,
the rebuilt homes are not extravagant,

00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:45.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the brothers often ended up
with something a lot better

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than what they had before

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:51.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the use
of improved building materials.

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And undoubtedly, this will help them
better weather future storms.

00:24:56.178 --> 00:24:59.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at this point,
we’d like to just take a moment

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:02.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thank you dear brothers
and commend you

00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your generous, generous contributions

00:25:07.022 --> 00:25:10.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make our relief ministry possible.

00:25:10.692 --> 00:25:13.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be sure that Jehovah is well-pleased.

00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:18.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, at Hebrews 13:16,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told:

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:24.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, do not forget to do good

00:25:24.806 --> 00:25:28.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to share what you have with others,

00:25:28.643 --> 00:25:33.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:35.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I love that thought.

00:25:35.016 --> 00:25:39.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not just pleased;
he’s “well-pleased” with your generosity.

00:25:39.821 --> 00:25:43.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thank you very much,
and the Governing Body thanks you

00:25:43.024 --> 00:25:45.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:47.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
who have been helped

00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:50.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thank you from the bottom of their hearts.

00:25:50.365 --> 00:25:52.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, enjoy this video,

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:54.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re going to see some of the brothers

in the United States and Africa

00:25:56.738 --> 00:26:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing their appreciation.

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:12.120 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has really helped us out

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this disaster by using

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:17.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brotherhood
to strengthen and encourage us

00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:19.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways we’ve never seen before.

00:26:19.728 --> 00:26:23.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really drawn us closer to him.

00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:26.001 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, through his organization,

00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:29.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave me two wonderful people

00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:32.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were there
to take care of my needs and my wants.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I needed
was handled through them

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just having someone that you can talk to;

00:26:38.613 --> 00:26:41.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just having people that care.

00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:44.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been in the truth almost 50 years,

00:26:44.653 --> 00:26:48.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve always had friends,
and it’s always been loving and good,

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I have never felt as loved by Jehovah.

00:26:55.997 --> 00:26:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Service Department called

00:26:57.999 --> 00:27:01.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and warned that a big storm
would arrive on Thursday.

00:27:01.503 --> 00:27:03.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We saw the true love

00:27:03.305 --> 00:27:05.140 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the branch office had for us,

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.142 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we followed their example.

00:27:07.142 --> 00:27:10.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We risked our lives to inform the brothers
to come to the Kingdom Hall.

00:27:10.979 --> 00:27:13.448 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brothers from the branch

00:27:13.448 --> 00:27:15.617 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were constantly in contact with us.

00:27:15.617 --> 00:27:17.686 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I found that really encouraging.

00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:20.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until very late in the evening,
they were sending us messages,

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:23.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling us that they
were still up praying for us.

00:27:23.591 --> 00:27:26.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those messages were a great comfort to us.

00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:29.164 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The organization

00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:32.000 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has been helping us so much emotionally.

00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:37.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch sent representatives
to provide shepherding

00:27:37.806 --> 00:27:40.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also a variety of food

00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:42.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good, nutritious food.

00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:46.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this has really been impressive.

00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:49.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to thank Jehovah
for the way he’s been caring for us.

00:27:50.518 --> 00:27:52.620 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What Jehovah’s organization

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is doing right now

00:27:53.822 --> 00:27:55.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is far superior than anything

00:27:55.824 --> 00:27:57.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the human governments have been doing.

00:27:59.394 --> 00:28:01.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We really want to say, “Thank you.”

00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:04.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We really feel Jehovah’s love.

00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:22.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing that video motivates us even more

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:27.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to want to help our brothers
by means of our donations

00:28:27.355 --> 00:28:29.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also by means of our labor.

00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:31.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking of labor,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re happy to inform you
that later in our program,

00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lösch will tell you
about a new provision

00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for applying to help with relief work

00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:45.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other needs in the organization.

00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:47.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So stay tuned

00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:51.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the revealing of that information.

00:28:51.112 --> 00:28:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now one more way, a third way,

00:28:53.782 --> 00:28:56.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relief ministry gives a good witness

00:28:56.751 --> 00:28:59.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and glorifies Jehovah

00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:04.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it gives a good witness to onlookers,

00:29:04.626 --> 00:29:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that glorifies Jehovah.

00:29:06.628 --> 00:29:09.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neighbors, family members,

00:29:09.597 --> 00:29:11.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government officials

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:16.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see our love in action.

00:29:16.237 --> 00:29:19.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
some actually come into the truth.

00:29:19.307 --> 00:29:21.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy this video.

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:25.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An unbelieving husband comes into the truth

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:27.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of our relief ministry.

00:29:32.587 --> 00:29:34.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always loved my family.

00:29:34.589 --> 00:29:36.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted the best for them.

00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:37.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I worked to provide for them.

00:29:37.325 --> 00:29:38.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my duty.

00:29:38.993 --> 00:29:41.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife got baptized two years before me.

00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:45.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I built our home right here.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day, our lives changed forever.

00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:53.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my house,

00:29:53.074 --> 00:29:55.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I have to start again.

00:29:56.845 --> 00:29:59.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two brothers came to see me.

00:29:59.113 --> 00:30:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said: “Don’t worry about a thing.

00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:03.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everything will be all right.

00:30:03.384 --> 00:30:05.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers will take care of it.”

00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:09.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘Hmm, I don’t know
if he knows what he’s talking about.’

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:13.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the brothers
started showing up at my place to help,

00:30:13.962 --> 00:30:16.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking: ‘Why would they help me?

00:30:16.698 --> 00:30:18.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t know me.’

00:30:19.434 --> 00:30:21.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every morning I watched the brothers.

00:30:21.436 --> 00:30:25.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they finished praying,
everyone grabbed their tools and got to work.

00:30:25.306 --> 00:30:29.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told my wife that this was unbelievable.

00:30:31.112 --> 00:30:33.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw an elderly sister
carrying concrete blocks

00:30:33.815 --> 00:30:36.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they were so heavy for her),

00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:38.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I ran inside with tears in my eyes.

00:30:38.553 --> 00:30:40.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want anyone to see me cry.

00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:45.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,
‘Something is wrong with them for sure,

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something is wrong with me.’

00:30:50.198 --> 00:30:54.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to appreciate
what they did and how they acted.

00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:56.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of love
—that is the only way I can put it—

00:30:56.838 --> 00:30:58.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of love.

00:30:59.908 --> 00:31:02.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even shared their food with me.

00:31:02.577 --> 00:31:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made it clear that this work
was a sign of Jehovah’s love.

00:31:07.982 --> 00:31:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all those things touched my heart.

00:31:10.518 --> 00:31:12.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They let me know that, man,

00:31:12.687 --> 00:31:14.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this organization is for real,

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:16.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s the truth.

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to be part of that.

00:31:19.327 --> 00:31:21.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to give my life to Jehovah

00:31:21.663 --> 00:31:26.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he showed me how much
he loves both me and my family.

00:31:27.936 --> 00:31:31.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I take care of my family
better than ever before.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review,
our relief ministry 

00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:49.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a loving expression

00:31:49.223 --> 00:31:53.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the God of comfort
and relief whom we serve.

00:31:53.528 --> 00:31:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of it,
Jehovah uses us to provide

00:31:57.265 --> 00:32:00.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physical, emotional,
and spiritual relief to our brothers.

00:32:00.768 --> 00:32:02.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it glorifies Jehovah

00:32:02.804 --> 00:32:06.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) by identifying us as true Christians,

00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:11.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) by uniting us as brothers and sisters

00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:15.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in love, prayer, action,
and giving contributions,

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it glorifies Jehovah

00:32:18.052 --> 00:32:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) by attracting
honesthearted ones to the truth.

00:32:23.057 --> 00:32:25.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy we are

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:30.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that soon Jehovah
will provide permanent relief!

00:32:30.331 --> 00:32:32.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be no more disasters.

00:32:32.967 --> 00:32:35.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until that grand time,

00:32:35.536 --> 00:32:38.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will continue to exert ourselves

00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:42.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our relief ministry
in behalf of our brothers.

00:32:42.176 --> 00:32:46.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so will help us
to remain focused on spiritual things,

00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:49.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will unite us as brothers and sisters,

00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:53.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will give a unique witness to onlookers,

00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:56.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will help prepare us

00:32:56.257 --> 00:32:58.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the great tribulation

00:32:58.793 --> 00:33:03.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the great reconstruction to follow.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Lett.

00:33:14.709 --> 00:33:19.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a relief to know
that the brotherhood provides relief

00:33:19.714 --> 00:33:23.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in times of disaster, isn’t it?

00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:27.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now have a video we invite you to enjoy.

00:33:27.455 --> 00:33:29.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is entitled

00:33:29.457 --> 00:33:35.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘The Good Hand of Our God Is Upon Us . . .</i>
<i>Let Us Get Up and Build.’</i>

00:33:43.204 --> 00:33:46.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization now cares

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for almost 80,000 buildings worldwide,

00:33:49.877 --> 00:33:55.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a total area
of more than 215 million square feet,

00:33:55.049 --> 00:33:57.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 20 million square meters.

00:33:57.618 --> 00:33:59.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the area

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of about 2,800 soccer fields,

00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:06.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or six times the area
of Central Park in Manhattan.

00:34:08.029 --> 00:34:10.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scores of branch office buildings,

00:34:10.498 --> 00:34:12.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds of Assembly Halls,

00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:16.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tens of thousands
of Kingdom Halls around the world

00:34:16.504 --> 00:34:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provide tangible proof

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s Kingdom is ruling.

00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:23.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that?

00:34:24.612 --> 00:34:27.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Psalm 127:1 reminds us,

00:34:27.682 --> 00:34:32.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of this would be possible
without Jehovah’s blessing.

00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:37.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Nehemiah and the Jews
who rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls,

00:34:37.225 --> 00:34:39.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are confident

00:34:39.227 --> 00:34:42.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘the good hand
of our God is upon us.’

00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These buildings
have been dedicated to Jehovah.

00:34:47.902 --> 00:34:50.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it is a privilege for us to make sure

00:34:50.538 --> 00:34:54.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they continue to measure up
to the purpose for which they were built.

00:34:54.408 --> 00:34:58.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our branch facilities
are especially well-maintained.

00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:02.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of these properties are relatively new,

00:35:02.784 --> 00:35:07.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many others are 30 or more years old.

00:35:07.121 --> 00:35:12.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A building itself may last
30, 60, or even 100 years,

00:35:12.126 --> 00:35:15.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but building systems
may reach the end of their life

00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:18.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after only 15 or 20 years.

00:35:18.065 --> 00:35:20.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many of our facilities are in need

00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of major renovation or replacement.

00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:27.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Activities at Bethel are also changing.

00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:31.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So interior layouts
sometimes need to be updated.

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:35.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this presents a challenge:

00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:38.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we take care of our Bethel facilities

00:35:38.252 --> 00:35:41.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still keep up
with the work on our Kingdom Halls?

00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:43.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, what is the need?

00:35:43.424 --> 00:35:45.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we address it?

00:35:45.426 --> 00:35:47.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can you help?

00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:51.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Join us now
on an encouraging trip around the world.

00:35:53.167 --> 00:35:55.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to show you what’s being done

00:35:55.336 --> 00:35:58.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and planned for our branch facilities.

00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:00.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fasten your seat belts, please.

00:36:00.508 --> 00:36:03.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This report will be moving quickly.

00:36:07.481 --> 00:36:10.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brains are not good
at noticing gradual change.

00:36:10.952 --> 00:36:12.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, the organization

00:36:12.954 --> 00:36:15.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began a program a few years ago

00:36:15.122 --> 00:36:17.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to evaluate the current and future needs

00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:20.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our properties every two to three years.

00:36:20.228 --> 00:36:22.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on this assessment,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a decision can be made for each property

00:36:24.498 --> 00:36:27.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on whether or not to renovate
and what that should involve.

00:36:29.136 --> 00:36:31.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, it makes more sense

00:36:31.138 --> 00:36:33.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to renovate or redevelop
what we already have.

00:36:33.975 --> 00:36:38.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Major renovations have already started
in branches that need it the most.

00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:44.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body would like to see

00:36:44.652 --> 00:36:48.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more of the Bethelites
care for their own personal services.

00:36:48.723 --> 00:36:52.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The offices always used to be 

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
individual, for one person.

00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s better if the offices
are open and use dividers

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:02.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because these
can be easily changed and modified

00:37:02.169 --> 00:37:04.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the necessity of the work.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Patterson is
a beautiful and practical complex.

00:37:12.246 --> 00:37:13.915 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think anyone envisioned

00:37:13.915 --> 00:37:15.182 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when the complex was built

00:37:15.182 --> 00:37:16.651 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we would have over a thousand

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:17.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters

00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:19.353 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
visiting Bethel every day.

00:37:19.353 --> 00:37:22.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But having a visitor’s center
is going to give them

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:25.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an improved tour experience
here at Patterson

00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:28.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the same time make sure
that departments are able to do their work.

00:37:36.237 --> 00:37:39.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2013, the Governing Body decided

00:37:39.473 --> 00:37:43.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to merge the Finland branch
with several other branches.

00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:48.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, the oldest parts
of the facility were almost 60 years old.

00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:53.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had been printing literature
in Finland for 83 years.

00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:57.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, under the guidance
of the Governing Body,

00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:01.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was decided
that we will stop printing in Finland

00:38:01.128 --> 00:38:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use the space of the old printery

00:38:03.764 --> 00:38:06.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for new offices and other purposes.

00:38:08.302 --> 00:38:10.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were a little concerned

00:38:10.338 --> 00:38:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we would find
all the needed volunteers.

00:38:13.941 --> 00:38:18.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we told about our needs
to local congregations,

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:21.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the applications started to flow in.

00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:24.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that here we have

00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:28.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fine young brothers and sisters.

00:38:28.089 --> 00:38:30.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been touching, really touching,

00:38:30.257 --> 00:38:32.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see their willing spirit.

00:38:34.362 --> 00:38:38.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, it’s not practical
to renovate a property,

00:38:38.332 --> 00:38:41.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we would purchase
or build new buildings

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:43.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then sell the old ones.

00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:46.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was recently decided, for example,

00:38:46.173 --> 00:38:49.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Argentina, Cameroon, and India.

00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:56.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Bethel family decreased

00:38:56.751 --> 00:39:00.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from around 350 to 150.

00:39:00.454 --> 00:39:04.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The multiple buildings
were spread across several properties,

00:39:04.992 --> 00:39:08.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the reduction,
many of them were no longer being used.

00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:12.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was decided
that our Bethel facilities be sold

00:39:12.333 --> 00:39:16.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to begin a search
for a new Bethel facility.

00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:18.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The timing had to be precise

00:39:18.939 --> 00:39:22.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the purchase
and construction of a new facility

00:39:22.143 --> 00:39:24.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sale of all current properties.

00:39:26.747 --> 00:39:29.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw Jehovah’s direction clearly.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the one hand,
we had the sale of all the properties,

00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:38.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the other hand,
the purchase of the new project.

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both processes climaxed
within the same 24-hour period.

00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:49.103 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom preaching work

00:39:49.103 --> 00:39:51.005 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has sped up in our branch territory.

00:39:51.005 --> 00:39:52.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’ve experienced a 4 percent increase

00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:53.474 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Cameroon

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:55.209 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
like we’ve never experienced before.

00:39:55.209 --> 00:39:58.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re now translating
into 29 different languages.

00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:02.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did consider renovating
our present location,

00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:05.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how do you continue the work

00:40:05.086 --> 00:40:08.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tiny branch while a renovation
is happening around you?

00:40:08.556 --> 00:40:12.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a piece of land
right next to one of our major Assembly Halls

00:40:12.426 --> 00:40:14.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one of the biggest cities
in our branch territory.

00:40:14.995 --> 00:40:17.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly,
the access was terrible

00:40:17.431 --> 00:40:21.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a dirty, muddy road,
very difficult to access either in a car

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:24.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on foot.

00:40:24.438 --> 00:40:26.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of a sudden something amazing happened.

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:31.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The local government decided to build
a road right outside our Assembly Hall,

00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:33.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus giving us access to this piece of land.

00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah saying,

00:40:35.816 --> 00:40:39.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is the piece of land where you
should build the new Cameroon branch.’

00:40:43.257 --> 00:40:47.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our facility was
now oversized for our real needs.

00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:51.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body directed
that we sell this property

00:40:51.565 --> 00:40:54.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relocate the branch
to a more economical facility.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that we
were millions of dollars short

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:00.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the needed funds.

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed a buyer who would agree to buy

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:05.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the facility at the right price,

00:41:05.913 --> 00:41:09.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give us enough money in advance
to pay for the new branch,

00:41:09.817 --> 00:41:12.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow us
to keep using the existing branch

00:41:12.653 --> 00:41:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
till the new one was ready.

00:41:14.655 --> 00:41:16.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt very helpless.

00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few days before we were scheduled
to sign up for the new branch,

00:41:22.663 --> 00:41:25.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a buyer, who had shown interest

00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:28.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but had not yet committed to anything,

00:41:28.102 --> 00:41:31.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
signed a binding agreement
and met all our conditions.

00:41:31.438 --> 00:41:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also provided a large amount
of a nonrefundable deposit

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to purchase the new branch.

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:41.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing is impossible for Jehovah.

00:41:41.415 --> 00:41:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He timed everything perfectly.

00:41:44.318 --> 00:41:49.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many more projects like these
are in the planning stages.

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want all of our properties
to keep meeting the organization’s needs

00:41:53.861 --> 00:41:57.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflecting well on Jehovah.

00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:59.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides renovations,

00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:03.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of our branch facilities
are again being used to capacity.

00:42:06.941 --> 00:42:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number of publishers,
commuters, remote volunteers,

00:42:10.177 --> 00:42:12.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bethelites
has increased worldwide.

00:42:14.148 --> 00:42:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some countries have seen
an increase of 5, 7, or more percent

00:42:17.484 --> 00:42:19.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the number of publishers each year.

00:42:19.987 --> 00:42:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More work is also being done worldwide

00:42:23.724 --> 00:42:27.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in translation, 
video production,

00:42:27.194 --> 00:42:30.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
digital publishing,
and other important areas.

00:42:30.664 --> 00:42:33.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The organization pursues every avenue

00:42:33.734 --> 00:42:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our Bethel operations more efficient.

00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:41.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we will always need people
to do much of the work.

00:42:41.342 --> 00:42:43.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore,
planning has already begun to see

00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where additional expansion might be needed.

00:42:48.249 --> 00:42:50.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many world headquarters departments

00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:53.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involved in the planning process
to give input.

00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:56.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the Branch Committee
is involved in this.

00:42:57.024 --> 00:43:01.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before any facility is recommended
for expansion, questions are asked.

00:43:01.528 --> 00:43:06.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, is this expansion
going to directly advance

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching and teaching activity
in the country?

00:43:10.204 --> 00:43:12.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be
that with some operational changes,

00:43:12.473 --> 00:43:14.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the function of the branch

00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:17.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be discontinued in some way

00:43:17.878 --> 00:43:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or outsourced or simplified in some way

00:43:21.248 --> 00:43:23.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mean that we wouldn’t need to expand?

00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:27.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With recent changes in Bethel operations,

00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:31.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is possible for us
now to buy standard apartments

00:43:31.558 --> 00:43:34.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offices for a Bethel facility.

00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:38.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we need more offices and apartments,
we buy them from the market.

00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:41.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as these options are investigated,

00:43:41.635 --> 00:43:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look for Jehovah’s hand in this.

00:43:43.804 --> 00:43:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the evidence that his spirit
is behind one of these options?

00:43:47.641 --> 00:43:50.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has asked all of us

00:43:50.744 --> 00:43:53.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give priority to those activities

00:43:53.681 --> 00:43:58.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that contribute the most
to the spiritual welfare of God’s people

00:43:58.519 --> 00:44:02.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the advancement
of the global preaching work.”

00:44:02.156 --> 00:44:07.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This principle helps us
to prioritize our efforts worldwide.

00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:12.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is definitely a lot to do.

00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:15.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is really exciting to see

00:44:15.336 --> 00:44:17.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good hand of Jehovah
on his people today.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters everywhere

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are zealously supporting
this work with their time,

00:44:25.679 --> 00:44:28.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
financial resources, and prayers.

00:44:31.251 --> 00:44:34.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident
that Jehovah God will continue to bless

00:44:34.955 --> 00:44:38.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the collective efforts to provide
the facilities the organization needs.

00:44:40.461 --> 00:44:42.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the skills we are learning

00:44:42.629 --> 00:44:45.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only benefit us now

00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:48.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but into the future
—right into God’s new world.

00:44:59.046 --> 00:45:01.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for bringing us up-to-date

00:45:01.882 --> 00:45:06.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what is happening
with our Bethel facilities around the world.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Nehemiah prepared
to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls,

00:45:10.157 --> 00:45:14.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he took a prayerful and practical approach.

00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:16.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed that approach

00:45:16.263 --> 00:45:19.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Nehemiah acted in faith

00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:21.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relied fully on Jehovah.

00:45:22.403 --> 00:45:26.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the people saw
that Jehovah’s good hand was on Nehemiah,

00:45:26.006 --> 00:45:30.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they said:
“Let us get up and build.”

00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:33.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Governing Body today
makes facility decisions

00:45:33.614 --> 00:45:35.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a similar way.

00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:38.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They prayerfully analyze what is needed.

00:45:38.685 --> 00:45:43.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make sure we have
the necessary resources to finish the work.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then they present to God’s people

00:45:46.326 --> 00:45:48.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they have in mind to do

00:45:48.762 --> 00:45:51.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for their support.

00:45:51.098 --> 00:45:54.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is left for us to say?

00:45:54.368 --> 00:45:57.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for your loyal support

00:45:57.171 --> 00:46:01.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the days ahead
of all these important initiatives.

00:46:01.475 --> 00:46:03.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless you too

00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:07.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your willing and generous spirit.

00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now,
it’s time for us too

00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:13.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get up and build.

00:46:21.462 --> 00:46:23.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maintenance, renovation,

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:27.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and new construction are ongoing projects.

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does the Governing Body decide

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:33.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when and where to build new facilities?

00:46:33.106 --> 00:46:36.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We searched our archived video files

00:46:36.477 --> 00:46:38.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found some comments from some brothers

00:46:38.612 --> 00:46:43.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were involved
in property acquisition in years past.

00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:46.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These comments predate
the more recent decision

00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:50.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move world headquarters
out of Brooklyn, New York.

00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:54.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy
this faith-strengthening video entitled

00:46:54.328 --> 00:46:58.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>A Historic Look at Property Acquisitions.</i>

00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, originally the reason

00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:33.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we bought the Watchtower Farm

00:48:33.026 --> 00:48:34.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was that the family

00:48:34.261 --> 00:48:35.896 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was growing here in Brooklyn,

00:48:35.896 --> 00:48:38.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Mountain Farm was limited

00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:40.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was
only 100 and some acres (40 ha).

00:48:40.734 --> 00:48:45.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Brother Knorr
approved of us buying a piece of land.

00:48:53.814 --> 00:48:55.382 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brother there said

00:48:55.382 --> 00:48:57.584 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to both George and Max,

00:48:57.584 --> 00:48:59.252 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Well, you know,

00:48:59.252 --> 00:49:02.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we just had a family business meeting

00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:04.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just a few days ago,

00:49:04.925 --> 00:49:08.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to sell our property, our farm.”

00:49:10.063 --> 00:49:13.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the interesting thing
is that Brother Knorr said:

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is only going to be for a farm.

00:49:17.004 --> 00:49:20.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t get any ideas of anything else.

00:49:20.674 --> 00:49:22.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s for a farm.”

00:49:22.776 --> 00:49:27.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, back in 1960
when we bought that much land,

00:49:27.748 --> 00:49:30.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had no idea of a printery.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did the Lord have in mind for it?

00:49:32.953 --> 00:49:36.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had in mind to put the printery there.

00:49:36.289 --> 00:49:39.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were zealously going after a farm,

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we didn’t need string beans and potatoes.

00:49:43.196 --> 00:49:46.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed books and Bibles printed up there.

00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:49.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we see the good results of it today.

00:49:49.903 --> 00:49:51.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a difference!

00:49:51.438 --> 00:49:54.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who could ever think

00:49:54.474 --> 00:49:58.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Watchtower Farms could turn into being

00:49:58.979 --> 00:50:03.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the United States branch
of Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:50:03.517 --> 00:50:07.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That to me is a wonderful example

00:50:07.587 --> 00:50:10.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah leading the organization.

00:50:13.493 --> 00:50:15.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we started in 1980

00:50:15.962 --> 00:50:18.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking for suitable property

00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:21.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the city for expansion.

00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:25.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, we looked
at a piece of property over in Jersey.

00:50:25.138 --> 00:50:27.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an old school,
but the buildings were so bad

00:50:27.708 --> 00:50:30.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would’ve never gotten them fixed up.

00:50:30.077 --> 00:50:32.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we told the real estate man,

00:50:32.713 --> 00:50:36.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, we really don’t want it
—no use in looking anymore.”

00:50:36.983 --> 00:50:39.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he got a little upset,

00:50:39.486 --> 00:50:42.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said,
“Well, what do you want?”

00:50:42.155 --> 00:50:44.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said,
“What we really want

00:50:44.424 --> 00:50:48.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is something up near Suffern or Brewster,

00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:52.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about five or six hundred acres
(200-240 ha) of land

00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:56.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where there are roads and hills

00:50:56.336 --> 00:50:59.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and scenery and water and all that,”

00:50:59.206 --> 00:51:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking he’d never find it

00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’d looked all over the country.

00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:07.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the next day, about 11 o’clock,
he called me on the phone.

00:51:07.547 --> 00:51:09.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “I found your property.”

00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:12.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took it up with the Governing Body,

00:51:12.919 --> 00:51:15.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we looked at the property,
and they loved it.

00:51:16.957 --> 00:51:21.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We told the town
that we wanted four or five hundred people.

00:51:21.361 --> 00:51:25.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, before we got
our final permit to build,

00:51:25.065 --> 00:51:27.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had it up to 1,500,

00:51:27.634 --> 00:51:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re looking to adjust here and there

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accommodate what we need there now.

00:51:47.988 --> 00:51:52.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How these projects have met
the organization’s need is amazing

00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and at the proper time—

00:51:54.961 --> 00:51:57.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every one of these, no matter what!

00:51:58.632 --> 00:52:01.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we have millions in the truth.

00:52:01.401 --> 00:52:04.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible tells us
that we’re going to grow and fill the earth.

00:52:04.738 --> 00:52:07.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many millions of people

00:52:07.741 --> 00:52:10.610 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have in the truth
when Armageddon comes, we don’t know.

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know when Armageddon is coming.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not going backward;

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:18.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to continue to go ahead

00:52:18.919 --> 00:52:21.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing things more efficiently.

00:52:21.121 --> 00:52:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means you’re going to have to expand;
you’re going to have to build.

00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:28.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have to always be looking ahead.

00:52:28.528 --> 00:52:31.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right to the end,
we’re going to be giving out

00:52:31.498 --> 00:52:33.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual food at the right time.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know what the Lord is going to use

00:52:36.269 --> 00:52:39.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the great tribulation, immediately.

00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:41.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Couch said

00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and Brother Larson felt the same way):

00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:47.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Lord is running the organization,

00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:49.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so we’ve got to follow him.

00:52:49.616 --> 00:52:51.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whatever he tells us, we do it.”

00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:05.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so interesting
to see Jehovah’s direction

00:53:05.065 --> 00:53:08.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in locating useful properties,

00:53:08.401 --> 00:53:10.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that brings us to a related subject.

<i>A New Construction Project Is Being Planned.</i>

00:53:18.178 --> 00:53:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch and enjoy
the following presentation.

00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:28.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a time when technology

00:53:28.822 --> 00:53:30.991 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has allowed us to communicate

00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:33.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the truth of God’s Word

00:53:33.026 --> 00:53:36.096 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in new and exciting ways.

00:53:36.096 --> 00:53:40.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our modern world
has seen advancements in printing,

00:53:40.367 --> 00:53:44.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
radio, television, computers and,
of course, the Internet.

00:53:46.239 --> 00:53:50.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You likely can remember
a time just a few short years ago

00:53:50.043 --> 00:53:54.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we released only a handful
of videos every year.

00:53:54.381 --> 00:53:57.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these now number into the hundreds,

00:53:57.851 --> 00:54:01.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with videos created for use in the ministry,

00:54:01.922 --> 00:54:04.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
midweek meetings,

00:54:04.557 --> 00:54:07.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Broadcasting® programs,

00:54:07.928 --> 00:54:10.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regional conventions,

00:54:10.931 --> 00:54:15.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can’t forget
the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend </i> series.

00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:21.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization

00:54:21.641 --> 00:54:23.643 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has made use of videos over the years,

00:54:23.643 --> 00:54:25.312 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
over the decades.

00:54:25.312 --> 00:54:28.014 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But from 2014 forward,

00:54:28.014 --> 00:54:30.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have seen a dramatic increase in the use

00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:35.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of videos, and that has really
impacted how we teach

00:54:35.055 --> 00:54:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we reach hearts.

00:54:37.057 --> 00:54:40.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the demand for more videos,
more space was needed.

00:54:40.961 --> 00:54:43.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we purchased the Mt. Ebo property,

00:54:43.163 --> 00:54:46.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there we have been making
many of our large video productions.

00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:49.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the response

00:54:49.936 --> 00:54:52.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the brothers and sisters
in the field has been outstanding;

00:54:52.405 --> 00:54:54.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s been amazing!

00:54:54.741 --> 00:54:56.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually been very encouraging
for the Teaching Committee

00:54:56.977 --> 00:55:00.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Governing Body to see how
the brothers and sisters appreciate

00:55:00.947 --> 00:55:04.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the videos, the music,

00:55:04.284 --> 00:55:06.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the recordings that are produced.

00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:11.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s helping them to really understand
the teaching points in God’s Word.

00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:15.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps them to deal
with the anxieties and pressures of life.

00:55:15.462 --> 00:55:18.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really helps them to appreciate too
what’s happening around the world

00:55:18.865 --> 00:55:22.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they hear reports,
dramatizations, and interviews.

00:55:24.537 --> 00:55:26.639 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With this explosive growth

00:55:26.639 --> 00:55:29.609 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and even more coming on the horizon,

00:55:29.609 --> 00:55:31.945 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body has determined

00:55:31.945 --> 00:55:34.114 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s Jehovah’s direction

00:55:34.114 --> 00:55:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we take further steps
to support this expanded use of video.

00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:43.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we are thrilled to announce
an exciting initiative

00:55:43.123 --> 00:55:46.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
currently underway to accomplish this:

00:55:46.026 --> 00:55:49.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The creation of a site dedicated primarily

00:55:49.996 --> 00:55:52.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to media production.

00:55:52.032 --> 00:55:57.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The building of a new facility
in Ramapo, New York.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the Governing Body
has approved construction

00:56:06.379 --> 00:56:09.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an additional world headquarters complex

00:56:09.015 --> 00:56:13.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a 248-acre property purchased in 2009.

00:56:16.423 --> 00:56:20.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The property is located two miles,
or about three kilometers,

00:56:20.493 --> 00:56:23.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the existing world headquarters
facility in Warwick.

00:56:25.365 --> 00:56:28.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our objective is to build a facility

00:56:28.034 --> 00:56:30.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar in size to Warwick,

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would include ten residence buildings,

00:56:34.174 --> 00:56:37.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a main office building, eight studio spaces

00:56:37.343 --> 00:56:39.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for audio/video productions,

00:56:39.946 --> 00:56:42.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a multipurpose space

00:56:42.449 --> 00:56:45.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including kitchen, dining, and meeting area—

00:56:45.618 --> 00:56:48.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plus, a visitors’ center.

00:56:48.188 --> 00:56:50.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will culminate in a location capable

00:56:50.924 --> 00:56:54.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of housing over 1,000 volunteers,

00:56:54.194 --> 00:56:58.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 920 office spaces, and will accommodate

00:56:58.765 --> 00:57:02.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services,

00:57:02.268 --> 00:57:04.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Text Processing,

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Writing Correspondence,

00:57:06.306 --> 00:57:08.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Art Department.

00:57:10.443 --> 00:57:12.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Planning and engineering
are already underway.

00:57:12.946 --> 00:57:16.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are beginning our discussions
with the local authorities on this project.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:18.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Jehovah willing,

00:57:18.952 --> 00:57:22.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we hope to start site work in 2022

00:57:22.889 --> 00:57:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have a completed facility

00:57:25.225 --> 00:57:28.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by December 31, 2026.

00:57:28.795 --> 00:57:32.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One year ago this week in October,

00:57:32.432 --> 00:57:35.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Teaching Committee was discussing

00:57:35.168 --> 00:57:38.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that has been asked
of Audio/Video Services

00:57:38.271 --> 00:57:40.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all the videos that they’re producing.

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:43.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we could see that it was
a little bit difficult because this

00:57:43.042 --> 00:57:47.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
department was spread out
over four different complexes,

00:57:47.647 --> 00:57:49.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
10 different buildings,

00:57:49.916 --> 00:57:52.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 16 different floors.

00:57:52.018 --> 00:57:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So working together and collaborating

00:57:54.787 --> 00:57:57.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been a little difficult
by being spread out.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:59.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go back some years, 

00:57:59.092 --> 00:58:00.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was planned 

00:58:00.827 --> 00:58:02.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to increase the Bethel facility, 

00:58:02.629 --> 00:58:04.097 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
expand the Bethel facility,

00:58:04.097 --> 00:58:05.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at Patterson, New York.

00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:09.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, at that time, there were
two large construction projects underway

00:58:09.802 --> 00:58:12.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Wallkill and Warwick.

00:58:12.172 --> 00:58:14.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So another construction project

00:58:14.541 --> 00:58:16.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was just not feasible at that time.

00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:20.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Audio/Video Services still had needs
—immediate needs.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at that time the Governing Body
approved to purchase the building

00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:28.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mt. Ebo as a temporary solution.

00:58:28.688 --> 00:58:32.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The use of video
in our teaching programs was exploding,

00:58:32.692 --> 00:58:34.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so there was a need

00:58:34.694 --> 00:58:36.696 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for much more studio space

00:58:36.696 --> 00:58:39.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the associated spaces

00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:41.201 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to support video production.

00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:43.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After searching

00:58:43.236 --> 00:58:46.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the area of Patterson for additional space,

00:58:46.706 --> 00:58:49.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this property at Mt. Ebo rose to the top.

00:58:49.809 --> 00:58:52.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a smooth transaction,

00:58:52.879 --> 00:58:57.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were renovating
and using this space very quickly,

00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which all of us have benefited from since.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:05.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the intent was that AVS
would use it for ten years or so,

00:59:05.325 --> 00:59:08.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then when a more permanent
facility became available,

00:59:08.895 --> 00:59:13.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mt. Ebo would be sold
to recoup the original purchase price.

00:59:13.199 --> 00:59:15.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Ramapo

00:59:15.535 --> 00:59:19.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will become that more
permanent studio location.

00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:21.341 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When any functional department is split up

00:59:21.341 --> 00:59:23.576 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
over multiple locations,

00:59:23.576 --> 00:59:26.145 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it can involve a degree of inefficiency

00:59:26.145 --> 00:59:27.714 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it can also involve

00:59:27.714 --> 00:59:29.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a doubling up of tasks,

00:59:29.015 --> 00:59:31.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which creates a complex framework

00:59:31.017 --> 00:59:33.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for anyone to operate in.

00:59:33.052 --> 00:59:38.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having all Audio/Video Services
operating out of one facility

00:59:38.057 --> 00:59:42.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will surely mean a much
more collaborative environment

00:59:42.128 --> 00:59:44.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those brothers and sisters to work in.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:48.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the end result, obviously,
won’t affect the preaching work that we do

00:59:48.167 --> 00:59:53.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the teaching that we get in our meetings,
at the assemblies, and conventions.

00:59:53.172 --> 00:59:57.410 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To be able to consolidate the operations,

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:59.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a design was put together

00:59:59.579 --> 01:00:01.848 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and costing was put to the design.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was presented to the Governing Body,

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:07.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they gave us the OK to go ahead
and then meet again

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the town of Ramapo

01:00:09.656 --> 01:00:13.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which, now a decade later,
was an entirely new group of officials—

01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:16.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet with them to see if we’d
still get the same positive reception.

01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:20.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had an excellent reception from them.

01:00:20.066 --> 01:00:23.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They seemed to welcome us with open arms.

01:00:23.169 --> 01:00:26.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, we’re going to have
to meet their code and criteria,

01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:29.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they seem as though they want to have us

01:00:29.942 --> 01:00:33.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
develop that site as an audio/video facility.

01:00:33.446 --> 01:00:35.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the period of time
that we held the property,

01:00:35.982 --> 01:00:38.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we tried to sell it at different times.

01:00:38.818 --> 01:00:41.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite our best efforts

01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:45.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a variety
of different marketing exercises,

01:00:45.692 --> 01:00:49.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was very little interest expressed

01:00:49.195 --> 01:00:52.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the property at the time.

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:55.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when we began
thinking about expansion again,

01:00:55.668 --> 01:00:58.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was logical to look
to a property we already owned.

01:00:58.971 --> 01:01:01.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For almost a year now, we’ve been working

01:01:01.007 --> 01:01:03.109 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with preconstruction activities.

01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:06.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, that means
thousands and thousands of hours

01:01:06.112 --> 01:01:09.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in project planning and project design

01:01:09.449 --> 01:01:11.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to meet the requirements

01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:15.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the town and the state
to be able to obtain

01:01:15.188 --> 01:01:17.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a building permit for the project.

01:01:17.857 --> 01:01:21.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
once that building permit is obtained

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve actually put shovel to the ground,

01:01:23.696 --> 01:01:27.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we would expect
that we’d have four years or less

01:01:27.367 --> 01:01:29.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to actually deliver the project.

01:01:29.402 --> 01:01:31.404 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In recent projects

01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:34.741 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body has directed,

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:37.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
such as the Britain branch,

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:41.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adaptability was foremost
in the design of the offices.

01:01:41.314 --> 01:01:43.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, therefore, office space

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:47.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be reconfigured
as the needs of departments

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and functions at the branch changed.

01:01:49.522 --> 01:01:52.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the Britain project, some of the exciting

01:01:52.358 --> 01:01:54.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
new design features were, for example—

01:01:54.394 --> 01:01:55.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no central laundry.

01:01:55.895 --> 01:02:00.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each room has laundry facilities in it

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the occupant
can do their own laundry.

01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:06.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The multipurpose building
on that site is a building

01:02:06.606 --> 01:02:08.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be easily configured

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:10.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for various different functions.

01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:12.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Creating a building

01:02:12.578 --> 01:02:15.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that is modular allows the brothers,

01:02:15.615 --> 01:02:17.817 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as the needs evolve,

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to modify the building with the smallest

01:02:20.386 --> 01:02:22.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
amount of renovation cost possible.

01:02:22.388 --> 01:02:26.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These new design features
are very flexible in their nature,

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:29.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s very helpful
because our dynamic organization

01:02:29.796 --> 01:02:32.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is moving quickly,
and change is coming fast as well.

01:02:32.799 --> 01:02:34.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That allows us to move with it.

01:02:34.934 --> 01:02:38.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can reconfigure spaces
without any major expense

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep up with those changes
that are being made.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Ramapo audio/video studios

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be the largest in our organization.

01:02:46.879 --> 01:02:49.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been other audio/video studios
constructed around the world,

01:02:49.782 --> 01:02:53.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lessons learned
from these are already being brought forward

01:02:53.319 --> 01:02:56.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Ramapo AV studio.

01:02:56.556 --> 01:03:00.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that means we need you.

01:03:00.159 --> 01:03:03.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need your prayers,
your support, your strong backs

01:03:03.229 --> 01:03:07.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this project 
will call for thousands of volunteers,

01:03:07.934 --> 01:03:11.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with as many as 1,500 volunteers a day

01:03:11.637 --> 01:03:14.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the peak of construction.

01:03:14.407 --> 01:03:16.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have utmost confidence

01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:19.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 110:3, where it says:

01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:22.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your people will offer themselves willingly

01:03:22.982 --> 01:03:25.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the day of your military force.”

01:03:25.985 --> 01:03:28.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do not hold back.

01:03:28.254 --> 01:03:33.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do whatever you can
to support this exciting new initiative.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will need thousands upon thousands
of willing volunteers

01:03:36.796 --> 01:03:40.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are available for one week
to one month or six months,

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever the case may be,

01:03:42.335 --> 01:03:44.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with this project.

01:03:44.337 --> 01:03:47.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On recent large-scale projects,
we found it very successful

01:03:47.507 --> 01:03:50.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hire contractors for the specialized

01:03:50.843 --> 01:03:53.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the heavily mechanized
parts of the work,

01:03:53.813 --> 01:03:55.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the steel superstructures

01:03:55.982 --> 01:03:58.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the concrete
superstructures of the buildings,

01:03:58.017 --> 01:03:59.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the building envelopes,

01:03:59.852 --> 01:04:01.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cladding, or roofing,

01:04:01.487 --> 01:04:03.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to get volunteers

01:04:03.656 --> 01:04:06.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry out the all-important hidden work,

01:04:06.292 --> 01:04:08.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the detail really makes the difference

01:04:08.628 --> 01:04:11.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for example, the underground
utilities for the site works,

01:04:11.898 --> 01:04:14.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mechanical and electrical
fit out of the buildings,

01:04:14.534 --> 01:04:16.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the all-important finishes.

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:19.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to work with the LDC

01:04:19.038 --> 01:04:21.507 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to identify brothers and sisters

01:04:21.507 --> 01:04:23.509 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that can help and be trained now.

01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:25.044 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They could either be assigned

01:04:25.044 --> 01:04:27.046 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to local projects with the LDC

01:04:27.046 --> 01:04:30.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some of them could be invited 
to start helping on renovation projects

01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:32.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the one at Patterson.

01:04:32.485 --> 01:04:35.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will allow us
to start giving them valuable training now

01:04:35.855 --> 01:04:38.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be useful on the Ramapo project.

01:04:38.424 --> 01:04:41.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re hoping that on the Ramapo project,

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:45.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s spirit will energize
the brotherhood again

01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:47.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it did at Warwick
and also on the Britain project.

01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:50.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Really, from the initial concept design

01:04:50.169 --> 01:04:52.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the estimating and establishing budgets

01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:56.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and reviewing the personnel needs all the way

01:04:56.175 --> 01:04:58.377 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the first initial meetings with the town,

01:04:58.377 --> 01:05:00.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayerful consideration was given

01:05:00.913 --> 01:05:02.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all the brothers and sisters involved.

01:05:02.949 --> 01:05:05.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we could really see
in every one of those decisions

01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:07.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was steering this project,

01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:10.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knows already
how it will be completed.

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:13.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going back more than a decade ago

01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:16.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from between 2005 to 2009

01:05:16.762 --> 01:05:18.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were searching for property,

01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:20.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these two properties became available,

01:05:20.533 --> 01:05:23.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they both seemed
as though they were suitable.

01:05:23.436 --> 01:05:28.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was the organization’s decision
to go with one and not develop the other.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when it seems like there is a real need,

01:05:30.876 --> 01:05:35.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can develop the second property that
we already have (that we already own)

01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:38.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we already
have a good reception with.

01:05:38.084 --> 01:05:41.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, those things
are faith-strengthening because what I see

01:05:41.253 --> 01:05:44.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that the work we were doing a decade ago

01:05:44.056 --> 01:05:46.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the brothers and sisters

01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:48.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were involved
with (and the Branch Committee)—

01:05:48.427 --> 01:05:51.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know what the outcome might be.

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:54.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we didn’t know what the use
might be over this last decade.

01:05:54.767 --> 01:05:57.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now what we have is something

01:05:57.003 --> 01:06:00.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be very suitable as we move forward,
and to me that’s faith-strengthening.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see Jehovah’s hand in that.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:07.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Projects like this,
in addition to serving a very practical need,

01:06:07.279 --> 01:06:10.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offer an opportunity for Jehovah’s people

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:15.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show their thankfulness
and their zeal for him.

01:06:15.154 --> 01:06:19.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we experienced with Warwick,

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:22.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the project alone and the participation

01:06:22.628 --> 01:06:26.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters
from all over the country

01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:29.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resulted in a spiritual blessing

01:06:29.301 --> 01:06:34.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to thousands of individuals,
their families, and their congregations.

01:06:34.306 --> 01:06:36.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we fully expect this project

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:39.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have the same positive effect.

01:06:40.279 --> 01:06:43.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On a project of this scale,

01:06:43.516 --> 01:06:46.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the early strategic decisions
are absolutely crucial.

01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:48.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now with what we’ve seen;

01:06:48.654 --> 01:06:53.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the design
and project-planning teams coming together;

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:56.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the plans for the support, feeding,

01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:59.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
housing, and care of the volunteers;

01:06:59.298 --> 01:07:04.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the spirit that’s already evident
among those who are involved in the project;

01:07:04.303 --> 01:07:06.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the strong backing
of the Governing Body,

01:07:06.839 --> 01:07:10.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we clearly see
that Jehovah’s hand is with us.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:13.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 4:8 states:

01:07:13.245 --> 01:07:17.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Draw close to God,
and he will draw close to you.”

01:07:17.883 --> 01:07:20.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah is allowing ones

01:07:20.686 --> 01:07:25.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every opportunity to draw close to him
as never before.

01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:29.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he is speaking to them
through his inspired Word

01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:33.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as vivid artwork, beautiful music,

01:07:33.165 --> 01:07:35.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heart-touching videos.

01:07:35.835 --> 01:07:39.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s the feeling
of the entire Governing Body

01:07:39.672 --> 01:07:42.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this new site will allow us

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to produce even more wonderful products

01:07:44.844 --> 01:07:47.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to do just that.

01:08:27.186 --> 01:08:29.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good to note your enthusiasm.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to hear that information!

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:37.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the first part.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Parts 2 and 3 of the annual meeting,

01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:43.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll hear six talks
by Governing Body members

01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:47.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that refine our understanding of Bible truths

01:08:47.173 --> 01:08:50.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen our trust in Jehovah.

01:08:50.509 --> 01:08:53.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make sure to watch them when they appear

01:08:53.112 --> 01:08:56.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Video On Demand section
of JW Broadcasting

01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:59.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the next few weeks.

01:08:59.685 --> 01:09:04.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude this month’s program,
let’s travel to Papua New Guinea.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:07.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is located
in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Papua New Guinea covers

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:14.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the eastern half of the island
of New Guinea and includes

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:16.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other islands and atolls.

01:09:16.268 --> 01:09:20.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are three official languages
in Papua New Guinea:

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
English, Hiri Motu,

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the most widely used official language
—Tok Pisin.

01:09:26.011 --> 01:09:29.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides these 3 official languages,

01:09:29.982 --> 01:09:32.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is estimated that there are

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:36.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 800 other languages spoken here.

01:09:36.021 --> 01:09:41.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of these have fewer than 1,000 people.

01:09:41.026 --> 01:09:45.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This presents
a huge challenge in the ministry.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:49.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers use preaching carts
in high-traffic areas

01:09:49.235 --> 01:09:53.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to catch the attention of those passing by,

01:09:53.205 --> 01:09:57.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they use the videos
available in the local language

01:09:57.476 --> 01:09:59.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach the good news.

01:09:59.979 --> 01:10:02.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Kwaivagolo Congregation,

01:10:02.948 --> 01:10:05.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they walk up to five hours

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:07.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to reach their scattered territory.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:10.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their determination in the preaching work

01:10:10.556 --> 01:10:12.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is producing good fruit.

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 34 publishers

01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:19.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducting an average
of 38 Bible studies.

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:22.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hold their congregation meetings
in Hiri Motu,

01:10:22.568 --> 01:10:25.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their preaching is done primarily

01:10:25.271 --> 01:10:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the local language of Tubulamo.

01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:31.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When building the Kingdom Hall,

01:10:31.043 --> 01:10:34.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these brothers did all
of the excavation manually,

01:10:34.713 --> 01:10:37.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since machines were not available.

01:10:37.383 --> 01:10:40.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then they carried
all of the building supplies

01:10:40.052 --> 01:10:42.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up the mountain by hand

01:10:42.054 --> 01:10:46.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a trip that takes two to three hours.

01:10:47.359 --> 01:10:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers send you
their warm love and greetings,

01:10:52.031 --> 01:10:55.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we send ours in return.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:59.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah bless their love
and their zeal for his name.

01:11:00.606 --> 01:11:03.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:11:03.609 --> 01:11:06.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
