00:00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!
00:00:04 This month we will discuss how to meet the challenge
00:00:08 of bearing “thorough witness.”
00:00:10 Is your territory difficult to reach?
00:00:13 Do language and cultural differences make you apprehensive?
00:00:18 That’s what these publishers faced
00:00:20 when they moved to where the need is greater.
00:00:23 We’ll learn how they stepped up to the challenge.
00:00:27 This sister embraced the truth during a time of violent division
00:00:31 in Northern Ireland.
00:00:33 How did she muster up the courage to preach to everyone in her community?
00:00:38 We’ll see how Jehovah helped her.
00:00:42 And our new music video reminds us that absolutely nothing
00:00:45 can separate us from God’s love.
00:00:49 All this and more on JW Broadcasting.
00:01:11 Imagine the astonished look on the faces of the apostles.
00:01:15 The resurrected Jesus stands before them
00:01:18 on the Mount of Olives.
00:01:20 Just before he disappears into the clouds,
00:01:23 Jesus makes this profound declaration,
00:01:26 as recorded at Acts 1:8:
00:01:30 “You will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you,
00:01:35 “and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem,
00:01:38 “in all Judea and Samaria,
00:01:40 and to the most distant part of the earth.”
00:01:45 What an assignment!
00:01:47 They were to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom
00:01:50 throughout the earth.
00:01:52 Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed
00:01:55 and wondered how such a small band of preachers
00:01:59 could ever get this work done.
00:02:02 Ten days later, they received the promised holy spirit,
00:02:06 and they got to work.
00:02:08 True, they faced many challenges.
00:02:11 But that did not stop them.
00:02:14 Three years passed, and the preaching work
00:02:17 was expanded to include Gentiles.
00:02:20 We can read the moving account in Acts chapter 10.
00:02:24 First, an angel of God appears
00:02:27 to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.
00:02:30 Then, Peter responds to the leadings of God’s spirit
00:02:34 to go to the officer’s home.
00:02:36 There, Peter gives a thorough witness about Jesus
00:02:40 not only to Cornelius
00:02:42 but also to his family and friends.
00:02:46 As he concludes his discourse,
00:02:48 Peter explains the commission he received to be an evangelizer.
00:02:53 Let’s open to Acts 10:42,
00:02:57 and note the two main aspects
00:02:59 of the preaching work started by Jesus:
00:03:02 “Also, he ordered us to preach to the people
00:03:06 “and to give a thorough witness
00:03:09 “that this is the one decreed by God
00:03:11 to be judge of the living and the dead.”
00:03:15 First, Jesus commanded his disciples
00:03:18 “to preach to the people.”
00:03:20 In addition, they were “to give a thorough witness.”
00:03:24 The disciples were to search out honesthearted, deserving ones.
00:03:29 That would require a thorough coverage of their territory.
00:03:33 In spite of vicious persecution,
00:03:36 Christians in the first century obeyed Jesus’ command
00:03:39 to preach and to bear thorough witness.
00:03:43 And by about 60 of our Common Era,
00:03:45 less than 30 years after the Christians had received their commission,
00:03:50 Paul could write to the congregation in Colossae
00:03:53 that the good news had been “preached in all creation under heaven.”
00:03:59 What a testimony to the power of God’s holy spirit
00:04:04 and the faith, zeal,
00:04:06 and determination of those early disciples!
00:04:10 In the late 1800’s, a small group of Bible students
00:04:15 rose to the challenge of bearing thorough witness.
00:04:19 An article in the April 1881 issue of Zion’s Watch Tower
00:04:23 had the thrilling title
00:04:25 “Wanted 1,000 Preachers.”
00:04:29 Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are bearing witness
00:04:33 in 240 lands.
00:04:36 But doing so has its challenges.
00:04:39 What are some of those challenges, and what can we do to meet them?
00:04:44 Many of our brothers face the challenge of long distances,
00:04:47 climate extremes, rough terrain,
00:04:50 and poor travel conditions.
00:04:54 In some areas, just getting to meet people
00:04:57 is a challenge.
00:04:59 To add to the challenge, Revelation 14:6 reminds us
00:05:03 that the good news would be declared
00:05:05 “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.”
00:05:10 This can require learning a new language
00:05:13 and understanding different religious, ethnic,
00:05:16 and cultural backgrounds.
00:05:19 It can mean coping with unresponsive territories,
00:05:22 apathy, and poor living conditions.
00:05:26 Jesus warned that opposers would try
00:05:28 to hinder or stop the preaching work.
00:05:32 No doubt you are facing some form of challenge
00:05:35 in your local territory.
00:05:37 We cannot begin to give possible solutions
00:05:40 to all the obstacles we face today.
00:05:43 But it is helpful to learn how others are coping with their challenges,
00:05:48 and this can stimulate our thinking
00:05:51 to identify ways to meet our challenges.
00:05:55 Let’s focus on three Bible principles that will help us
00:05:59 to carry out our ministry successfully:
00:06:04 (1) Trust in Jehovah,
00:06:07 (2) be flexible,
00:06:10 and (3) stay focused.
00:06:15 How can trusting in Jehovah help us?
00:06:17 Consider an example.
00:06:20 During the 1990’s, Jehovah’s Witnesses in France
00:06:24 endured an avalanche of negative media reports.
00:06:28 As a result of these vicious attacks,
00:06:30 some brothers lost their jobs,
00:06:33 Witness children were taunted at school,
00:06:36 preaching became extremely difficult in some areas.
00:06:40 How did they cope?
00:06:42 The turning point came in January 1999.
00:06:46 The Governing Body approved a special campaign
00:06:49 to distribute a magazine-size tract
00:06:52 that exposed all of the accusations as false.
00:06:56 Beginning early one Friday morning, Witnesses throughout France
00:07:00 distributed 12 million copies of the tract
00:07:03 in just three days.
00:07:06 This campaign gave them renewed strength
00:07:08 and boldness to preach.
00:07:11 In the 19 years that followed,
00:07:13 there was a continuous increase in the number of publishers
00:07:17 and the ranks of regular pioneers
00:07:19 swelled to over 15,000.
00:07:23 If you constantly face a barrage of negative media reports,
00:07:27 does this mean that you need a special campaign to meet the challenge?
00:07:32 Not necessarily.
00:07:34 Although the campaign was a stimulus,
00:07:37 brothers and sisters in France said
00:07:39 that what really gave them strength and boldness
00:07:43 were the words of 2 Chronicles 32:8.
00:07:47 Let’s read it.
00:07:49 The setting is in the time of King Hezekiah of Judah.
00:07:53 The people were beaten down
00:07:56 by the repeated threats and taunts of the Assyrians.
00:08:00 What strengthened them?
00:08:02 Speaking about the king of Assyria, King Hezekiah declared:
00:08:07 “With him is an arm of flesh,
00:08:11 “but with us is Jehovah our God to help us
00:08:15 and to fight our battles.”
00:08:18 What was the result?
00:08:20 “The people were strengthened by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.”
00:08:25 Just hearing this reminder that Jehovah would help them
00:08:29 was enough to strengthen the Jews.
00:08:32 Jehovah took action and sent an angel
00:08:35 to destroy the enemy army.
00:08:38 Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?
00:08:42 Note what we read at Revelation 14:6:
00:08:47 “I saw another angel flying in midheaven,
00:08:50 “and he had everlasting good news to declare
00:08:54 “to those who dwell on the earth,
00:08:56 “to every nation and tribe
00:08:59 and tongue and people.”
00:09:02 Be sensitive to angelic direction
00:09:04 and the leadings of God’s holy spirit.
00:09:08 If you feel moved to make that one last call
00:09:11 or to speak to the person next to you on the bus, do it!
00:09:15 Speak up.
00:09:17 It may well be that an angel is directing you
00:09:20 to one who is “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
00:09:25 Now let’s consider the second Bible principle
00:09:28 that will help us to bear thorough witness:
00:09:31 Be flexible.
00:09:33 Sometimes just getting to talk to people can be a challenge.
00:09:37 To overcome this obstacle, we need to be flexible.
00:09:42 Takanori and Yumi Takahashi have served in territories
00:09:46 that are as different as night and day.
00:09:49 Recently, they visited our studio.
00:09:52 Listen as they tell us how they have learned
00:09:55 to meet the challenges of bearing thorough witness.
00:10:01 Takanori and Yumi,
00:10:03 welcome to our studio!
00:10:05 Thank you for inviting us.
00:10:06 And we’re very happy to have you here.
00:10:09 Takanori, you and I go back a long way.
00:10:12 I still remember when you came into Japan Bethel back in 1977,
00:10:17 and we served in the same congregation for a number of years.
00:10:21 But then in 1990, you had a big change in your life.
00:10:25 Would you like to tell us what happened?
00:10:27 Yes, my twin brother,
00:10:30 Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.
00:10:34 To our surprise, we were assigned
00:10:37 to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.
00:10:39 That was a big change!
00:10:41 And here you are working in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.
00:10:45 During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,
00:10:48 I understand that you served in the missionary field,
00:10:51 in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.
00:10:54 So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?
00:10:57 Takanori and I were married in September 1993,
00:11:01 and I joined him in the missionary work.
00:11:04 Adapting to remote territories such as this was a challenge.
00:11:09 So in order to bear thorough witness,
00:11:12 what kind of challenges did you have to overcome?
00:11:15 The people of Papua New Guinea are very friendly.
00:11:19 They have a deep respect for the Bible.
00:11:22 It was easy to relax,
00:11:24 speak to them face-to-face,
00:11:27 to read the Scriptures together, and reason with them.
00:11:31 Those don’t sound like challenges.
00:11:33 Did you face any obstacles?
00:11:35 When we preached in the villages,
00:11:38 the response of the local people
00:11:41 often depended on the response of the village chief.
00:11:45 If he listened, almost the whole village listened.
00:11:49 But if his response was negative,
00:11:52 the people would walk away and hide in the bush.
00:11:56 So we would always show respect
00:12:00 and approach the village chief first.
00:12:04 This often moved him to view our visit with favor.
00:12:08 The challenge in the cities was mainly security.
00:12:12 It wasn’t safe for us to go into some areas alone
00:12:16 or to visit homes regularly.
00:12:19 So we would ask our Bible students to come to the Kingdom Hall
00:12:23 for their study before the meeting.
00:12:27 That was a good way to encourage them to attend meetings.
00:12:31 Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed your service in Papua New Guinea.
00:12:35 But now you’re serving as special pioneers in the Maihama Congregation
00:12:39 just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.
00:12:43 So you went from a territory where people have deep respect for the Bible
00:12:47 to a land where less than 1 percent of the people claim to be Christian.
00:12:51 So, what other kind of differences did you find
00:12:55 between your territory in Japan now and your missionary territory?
00:12:59 Oh, it’s very different.
00:13:02 Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,
00:13:05 and 70 percent of the homes
00:13:08 are in high-security apartment buildings.
00:13:11 We have to stand in the lobby in front of the doorman,
00:13:15 push a button, and speak to a camera.
00:13:19 Coming from Papua New Guinea,
00:13:22 we found it challenging to work this territory.
00:13:25 We were used to friendly discussions face-to-face.
00:13:29 Now we see only the lens of a camera.
00:13:32 But we have learned to view the camera as our friend.
00:13:37 As your friend?
00:13:39 I think most of us find it challenging to speak to a camera.
00:13:42 So how do you overcome this challenge?
00:13:45 We know that as soon as we push the button,
00:13:49 our face shows up on a screen inside of the apartment.
00:13:52 We stand an arm’s length from the camera
00:13:56 so that our face is framed nicely.
00:13:59 And we adjust our volume accordingly,
00:14:02 taking into consideration the doorman and others who may be listening.
00:14:08 We say our greeting
00:14:10 about two seconds after we push the button,
00:14:13 just when we know that they are looking at the monitor.
00:14:17 Our friendly greeting and warm smile
00:14:20 makes them feel like we can actually see their face.
00:14:26 We prepare a specific appealing introduction
00:14:29 and show them respect and consideration.
00:14:34 The people in our territory like to be viewed as successful,
00:14:39 not as people who have problems.
00:14:41 So we try to focus on positive subjects.
00:14:45 We prepare a variety of subjects
00:14:48 so that they don’t hear the same message over and over.
00:14:53 Like many people, Japanese do not like to be put on the spot.
00:14:58 So instead of asking a question and waiting for them to answer,
00:15:03 we use the teaching method of our tracts
00:15:07 and give three possible answers for them to choose from.
00:15:10 Well, have you had positive results from this intercom preaching?
00:15:15 Since we started to use this method,
00:15:18 the number of not-at-homes has decreased.
00:15:21 And also, when we meet people on the street,
00:15:24 sometimes they say they know us
00:15:27 because they saw us on their intercom.
00:15:31 That was excellent!
00:15:32 And thank you, Takanori and Yumi, for sharing with us
00:15:36 how you have met the challenge of bearing thorough witness
00:15:39 in a variety of territories.
00:15:43 First Corinthians 9:22, 23
00:15:47 —let’s read it.
00:15:50 “I have become all things
00:15:52 “to people of all sorts,
00:15:54 “so that I might by all possible means save some.
00:15:58 “But I do all things
00:16:00 “for the sake of the good news,
00:16:02 in order to share it with others.”
00:16:06 “Become all things.”
00:16:08 “Do all things.”
00:16:09 In other words, be flexible.
00:16:12 Apply the suggestions in the meeting workbook.
00:16:16 Get well-acquainted with each tool in the Teaching Toolbox.
00:16:20 Observe how experienced publishers
00:16:23 and pioneers use those tools.
00:16:25 Understand the feelings and circumstances
00:16:28 of people in the territory.
00:16:31 Even in the same territory, we may need to use a variety of approaches.
00:16:36 For example, about 40 percent
00:16:38 of the apartment buildings in the Takahashi’s territory
00:16:41 do not allow the Witnesses to enter the lobby,
00:16:44 so they do public and informal witnessing to reach those people.
00:16:49 Now let’s consider the third Bible principle:
00:16:53 Stay focused.
00:16:55 At Matthew 6:22, Jesus said:
00:16:58 “The lamp of the body is the eye.
00:17:01 “If, then, your eye is focused,
00:17:04 your whole body will be bright.”
00:17:08 Keeping our eye focused means keeping our life simple
00:17:13 in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.
00:17:17 Distractions take our attention and energy away
00:17:20 from our responsibility to bear thorough witness.
00:17:23 Before we can teach those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life,”
00:17:28 we have to find them.
00:17:30 We leave no stone unturned as we search for them at their homes,
00:17:34 on the streets, in parks,
00:17:37 in stores, and at the workplace.
00:17:40 There’s no on/off switch for our preaching work.
00:17:45 Our “preaching switch” must be on
00:17:49 at all times.
00:17:51 Not only do we look for opportunities to preach
00:17:55 but we also make opportunities.
00:17:58 What if our efforts to find interested ones
00:18:01 are not fruitful?
00:18:03 Jesus did not say that every human
00:18:05 must become a disciple before the end comes.
00:18:08 Rather, he said that the end will come
00:18:12 after the good news has been preached in all the inhabited earth
00:18:16 and a witness has been given to all the nations.
00:18:20 The apostle Paul stayed focused on his ministry.
00:18:24 May we imitate his positive attitude
00:18:27 expressed at Acts 20:24:
00:18:31 “Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life
00:18:36 “of any importance to me,
00:18:38 “if only I may finish my course
00:18:41 “and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus,
00:18:44 “to bear thorough witness to the good news
00:18:48 of the undeserved kindness of God.”
00:18:52 The opportunity to bear thorough witness will soon be over.
00:18:57 May we use the remaining time effectively
00:19:00 to search for deserving ones
00:19:02 and to teach them the truth.
00:19:06 Imitate the faith of Hezekiah,
00:19:09 and trust in Jehovah;
00:19:11 learn from the apostle Paul,
00:19:14 and be flexible;
00:19:16 obey Jesus’ direction,
00:19:19 and stay focused.
00:19:21 Then you too can meet the challenge
00:19:24 of bearing “thorough witness.”
00:19:28 Another challenge of bearing thorough witness
00:19:31 is preaching in the midst of civil unrest.
00:19:35 Starting in the 1960’s,
00:19:37 our brothers in Northern Ireland
00:19:39 endured 30 violent years
00:19:42 known as the “Troubles.”
00:19:45 Kay Harrigan learned the truth during those difficult times.
00:19:49 Listen as Kay describes how she was drawn to the truth
00:19:53 and how it changed her life.
00:25:03 Trusting in Jehovah helped Kay overcome her fears.
00:25:08 What blessings did she receive?
00:25:11 Kay said that she has the happiness of bringing good news to everyone.
00:25:18 Since 2013, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:25:22 has prepared brothers and sisters to serve where there is a greater need.
00:25:27 Even with this training, however,
00:25:29 graduates sometimes find their assignments challenging.
00:25:33 We’ll see that in our next segment from Tanzania.
00:25:39 I wanted to help the deaf
00:25:41 so that they too can know Jehovah.
00:25:44 So I decided to move to a sign-language territory:
00:25:47 the sign-language group in Dar es Salaam.
00:25:51 We had to travel by bus, and sometimes we traveled far
00:25:55 (stuck in a traffic jam for two to three hours),
00:25:58 and it was expensive.
00:26:03 I still remember my early days in service
00:26:06 with the sign-language group.
00:26:07 I was very inexperienced with the language,
00:26:10 and one day, my service partner asked me to conduct her Bible study.
00:26:15 Every time I tried to talk to the student, argh, she didn’t understand.
00:26:21 As I kept trying, she became more and more frustrated with me,
00:26:25 and I started to feel discouraged.
00:26:28 I wanted to help, but I was powerless.
00:26:33 I felt bad.
00:26:35 I told myself: ‘I still don’t know the deaf.
00:26:38 ‘I still don’t know sign language.
00:26:40 ‘Why has Jehovah brought me into this field
00:26:43 in which I am not able to help the deaf?’
00:26:49 I was invited to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:26:52 in 2014, from September to November.
00:26:56 After graduating, I received an assignment in sign language again.
00:27:01 Jehovah truly helped me so much.
00:27:04 That was exactly the encouragement I needed to persevere
00:27:08 in learning the language and becoming more effective in my assignment.
00:27:11 I was able to conduct my own Bible studies,
00:27:14 and they could really understand me now.
00:27:17 When we started, there were two baptized deaf publishers,
00:27:22 but now there are over ten.
00:27:24 I’ve had the opportunity to help three deaf people to make progress,
00:27:28 to dedicate themselves to Jehovah, and to get baptized.
00:27:32 The training I received at the school is still helping me now
00:27:35 in my new assignment at the translation office,
00:27:39 where I serve together with my husband.
00:27:41 We are joyful because we know that through this work,
00:27:44 many deaf people will receive publications in their language
00:27:47 and this will bring about an increase in this territory.
00:27:54 I graduated from the School
00:27:56 for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015.
00:28:00 And it was a privilege to receive the assignment
00:28:03 to go help the Maasai to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.
00:28:10 Traveling is difficult.
00:28:12 Sometimes I travel by vehicle,
00:28:15 but sometimes there are areas in which there are no vehicles,
00:28:18 so I’m forced to walk.
00:28:22 Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle
00:28:25 to reach many more people.
00:28:28 But still, transportation is a difficult part of it:
00:28:31 there are valleys, there are mountains,
00:28:34 there are uphills, there are downhills.
00:28:37 So transportation is difficult.
00:28:40 When I finally reached the territory,
00:28:43 I was able to find the Maasai.
00:28:46 I was apprehensive about their reaction
00:28:49 because I know their culture;
00:28:51 they don’t know Jehovah.
00:28:54 So I wondered what would happen when I reached their territory.
00:28:58 During that stressful time,
00:29:00 I prayed to Jehovah;
00:29:03 I read his Word, the Bible;
00:29:06 I meditated on accounts of our brothers and sisters mentioned in the Bible;
00:29:10 and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.
00:29:14 I was able to return to them,
00:29:17 make return visits, and start Bible studies.
00:29:20 So the results have been good.
00:29:22 I am happy
00:29:24 that after starting studies,
00:29:27 some started taking steps and attending meetings.
00:29:30 They later made good progress,
00:29:33 and now some of them are our brothers and sisters.
00:29:36 They dedicated themselves and were baptized.
00:29:40 I feel so much joy.
00:29:43 Jehovah has given me the strength and the ability
00:29:46 to be used to further the preaching of the good news
00:29:49 and to help the Maasai spiritually.
00:29:55 Sabina said that she was discouraged.
00:29:58 Saitoti was stressed.
00:30:01 Have you ever felt that way about your ministry?
00:30:04 What helped them?
00:30:06 Sabina persevered.
00:30:09 She became proficient in sign language
00:30:12 and had the joy of helping several deaf ones learn the truth.
00:30:16 Saitoti relied on prayer and meditation.
00:30:20 Jehovah gave him the strength to bear witness to the Maasai.
00:30:24 And we saw the encouraging results.
00:30:28 As our new music video shows,
00:30:30 we can be convinced that Jehovah will always be with his people,
00:30:35 no matter what we face.
00:30:49 You have been praying. You have been preaching.
00:30:56 You have been loyal through ev’rything.
00:31:01 And though we don’t see all the trials you face,
00:31:07 Know that Jehovah’s seeing it all.
00:31:12 So when you stand in front of court officials,
00:31:17 You are not alone.
00:31:19 Your example speaks to all of us, And Jehovah knows.
00:31:25 ‘For I am convinced
00:31:27 That death nor life nor governments will separate us from God’s love.’
00:31:36 ‘For I am convinced
00:31:39 That things to come nor powers can separate us from God’s love.’
00:31:47 So please be convinced That you are in God’s love.
00:32:06 You have been faithful. You have not wavered.
00:32:12 You looked to Jehovah through all the storms.
00:32:17 And though enemies try and stop the good news,
00:32:24 Know that you have much more backing you.
00:32:28 So when you stand in front of court officials,
00:32:33 You are not alone.
00:32:35 Your example speaks to all of us, And Jehovah knows.
00:32:41 ‘For I am convinced
00:32:43 That death nor life nor governments will separate us from God’s love.’
00:32:52 ‘For I am convinced
00:32:55 That things to come nor powers can separate us from God’s love.’
00:33:03 So please be convinced That you are in God’s love.
00:33:15 Please know you are.
00:33:22 It is written: ‘You would suffer for the One you love’—
00:33:30 Oh, the God you love.
00:33:34 ‘But on the contrary, you are coming off victorious’—
00:33:42 Oh, victorious.
00:33:45 ‘So I am convinced
00:33:48 That death nor life nor governments will separate us from God’s love.’
00:33:57 ‘For I am convinced
00:34:00 That things to come nor powers can separate us from God’s love.’
00:34:08 ‘For I am convinced
00:34:11 That death nor life nor governments will separate us from God’s love.’
00:34:20 ‘For I am convinced
00:34:23 That things to come nor powers can separate us from God’s love.’
00:34:32 So please be convinced That you are in God’s love.
00:34:41 Showing love and concern for people
00:34:43 is a vital element in bearing thorough witness.
00:34:47 This was the subject of a recent Morning Worship program
00:34:50 conducted by Brother William Turner,
00:34:52 and we’re happy to share it with you.
00:34:55 His theme is “Make Known ‘the Good News.’”
00:35:01 “How does it make you feel,
00:35:03 “knowing God’s support is real,
00:35:06 “and that he’s entrusted [us]
00:35:08 to do the work we do?”
00:35:10 We know that song.
00:35:12 We love that song.
00:35:15 But have you ever stopped to meditate on the lyrics?
00:35:19 How do we feel?
00:35:21 Because, really, it’s a tremendous, amazing privilege
00:35:25 that Jehovah has entrusted to his people
00:35:27 —the work of Kingdom preaching and disciple-making.
00:35:31 Now, while the work at Bethel contributes to the preaching work
00:35:35 in a very precious and unique way,
00:35:38 we still recognize it’s quite special
00:35:41 to be able to assist someone in the ministry
00:35:44 and watch them progress to the point of making a dedication
00:35:48 and symbolizing that by water baptism.
00:35:51 Our text comments mention the qualities
00:35:53 of gratitude and undeserved kindness.
00:35:57 And these are good qualities
00:35:59 because they’re qualities that motivate us,
00:36:01 that move us to action,
00:36:04 that touch our emotions.
00:36:06 Why is this emotional investment
00:36:09 so important when it comes to our ministry?
00:36:13 Well, think, for example,
00:36:15 of our greatest Teacher and Preacher
00:36:19 who ever walked the earth, and that is Jesus Christ.
00:36:22 Turn with me in your Bibles, please, to Luke chapter 19,
00:36:27 and we’ll just take a look at one instance
00:36:30 of how Jesus demonstrated this love and concern.
00:36:34 Luke 19:41
00:36:41 says: “And when he [that is, Jesus] got nearby,
00:36:46 “he viewed the city [Jerusalem]
00:36:50 and wept over it.”
00:36:54 How interesting!
00:36:55 Jesus’ heart was filled with so much emotion
00:37:00 that his eyes brimmed over with tears when he contemplated the people,
00:37:05 their rejection of the message,
00:37:07 the siege that was to follow.
00:37:09 Doesn’t that show his love for people?
00:37:12 And obviously, that love was made evident
00:37:15 the entire time that he was here on the earth.
00:37:17 Now, we may not give way to tears
00:37:20 every time we go into our territory and engage in the ministry,
00:37:24 but certainly we want to imitate Jesus’ example,
00:37:27 because it’s so vital that we have and demonstrate love for people.
00:37:33 It reminds me of a conversation I had with a missionary sister some time ago,
00:37:37 and at the time, she was revealing her personal circumstances.
00:37:39 And she felt that at that time
00:37:41 she could comfortably handle ten Bible studies.
00:37:45 So I asked her how things were going.
00:37:46 She said, “Well, actually I have 20.”
00:37:48 She said, “I was able to get rid of six.”
00:37:50 She said, “But I just can’t turn over these last four.”
00:37:54 She said, “They’re such a part of my life;
00:37:57 I just can’t let them go.”
00:38:00 Well, it sounds like a good problem to have.
00:38:03 But doesn’t it highlight her love for people?
00:38:06 She was emotionally invested.
00:38:09 Now, we also have to admit
00:38:12 that while preaching is a wonderful work,
00:38:15 actually carrying it out is not always easy to do.
00:38:20 Perhaps at times we may feel like the prophet Jeremiah.
00:38:24 You recall when he was commissioned as a prophet,
00:38:27 he gave Jehovah a number of reasons why he shouldn’t be selected.
00:38:30 He was too shy, too young, wasn’t able to speak well.
00:38:35 And then once he got into his assignment
00:38:37 and the opposition and the ridicule started
00:38:40 —well, let’s take note of his feelings.
00:38:42 Turn with me, please, to Jeremiah chapter 20,
00:38:51 Jeremiah chapter 20.
00:38:52 We’ll begin with the B  part of verse 8:
00:38:57 “For me the word of Jehovah
00:38:59 “has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.
00:39:03 “So I said: ‘I am not going to make mention of him,
00:39:07 and I will speak no more in his name.’”
00:39:13 Have you ever had times when you felt like Jeremiah,
00:39:17 when you just didn’t have the desire
00:39:20 or feel like speaking to others about Jehovah?
00:39:24 And maybe it was for similar reasons:
00:39:27 We’re shy; we feel nervous;
00:39:30 people in the territory are indifferent.
00:39:34 Or could it just be that we’re just tired?
00:39:38 The energy that we feel we need, we just don’t have it.
00:39:43 Is it normal to feel this way at times?
00:39:47 Absolutely.
00:39:49 But let’s take note of what Jeremiah says next.
00:39:52 Let’s finish verse 9.
00:39:54 He says: “But in my heart
00:39:56 “it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones,
00:40:01 “and I was tired of holding it in;
00:40:03 I could no longer endure it.”
00:40:06 You notice, it was Jeremiah’s love for Jehovah,
00:40:09 his zeal for the truth, his strong spirituality
00:40:12 —all of these were things that were able to help him remain invested
00:40:17 and be able to overcome any temporary discouragement
00:40:22 that he might have been feeling at that time.
00:40:25 So, what can help us to stay invested
00:40:28 and to maintain our love for people?
00:40:31 Well, there are many ways, but we’ll discuss two.
00:40:34 First, Jeremiah’s example shows us
00:40:37 that there is never a substitute
00:40:40 for the study of God’s Word.
00:40:43 Did you notice,
00:40:44 What was that ‘burning fire shut up in his bones’?
00:40:49 Verse 8 tells us it was “the word of Jehovah.”
00:40:53 So it was Jeremiah’s appreciation
00:40:56 for the importance of his message
00:40:59 that made him responsive
00:41:01 to the encouragement he received when he read God’s Word.
00:41:06 And it works the same for us as well.
00:41:09 Study of God’s Word helps to reinforce our love for Jehovah.
00:41:14 It’s a constant reminder that we’re living in the last days,
00:41:16 that we’re deep in the time of the end,
00:41:18 and that we need to do all that we can to find
00:41:21 those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
00:41:25 Yes, it is natural that we are going to experience
00:41:29 discouragement from time to time,
00:41:31 but when we pray to Jehovah for help,
00:41:33 you see, if his Word is in our hearts,
00:41:37 then Jehovah can freely impart his holy spirit to us.
00:41:41 He can give us what we need
00:41:43 to be bold preachers of the good news
00:41:46 and be productive in our ministry.
00:41:49 Now, the second thing that can help us
00:41:52 is applying the suggestions that are given to us
00:41:56 by the slave to help us improve our ministry.
00:42:00 Now, perhaps in the past,  preaching may have been difficult,
00:42:04 maybe just because of pressure we put upon ourselves.
00:42:07 Perhaps we may have felt that we had to have the perfect presentation
00:42:11 or we had to place a certain amount of literature.
00:42:15 But how loving it is that we see
00:42:17 that with the various adjustments that have been made in our ministry,
00:42:20 well, hopefully some of that anxiety has been lifted
00:42:23 because now we know our focus is on starting conversations!
00:42:27 And with the help of prayer and God’s spirit,
00:42:30 we can see how that just naturally progresses into a witness.
00:42:35 If we just think back for a moment to the example of Jesus,
00:42:37 we can only imagine how many preaching opportunities
00:42:41 Jesus must have had just from starting conversations.
00:42:46 Of course, the one we’re most familiar with is in John chapter 4
00:42:49 —the Samaritan woman at the well.
00:42:51 Not only was that a great witness
00:42:54 but just think about all of those who became believers afterward.
00:42:59 And all of that started simply from Jesus starting a conversation
00:43:04 —asking for water.
00:43:08 We may not always have as many opportunities at Bethel
00:43:11 to engage in the house-to-house work as we would like,
00:43:14 but certainly as we travel, as we move about,
00:43:17 this can present greater opportunities
00:43:20 to start conversations.
00:43:22 In last month’s meeting workbook, there was an article
00:43:26 “Starting Conversations That Can Lead to a Witness,”
00:43:29 and that article just provided many excellent, practical suggestions
00:43:34 that we can implement.
00:43:36 So if we follow these suggestions,
00:43:38 well, this is a nice way that we can show and demonstrate our gratitude.
00:43:43 We’re making the best use of our time to start a witness.
00:43:47 So, as we mentioned,
00:43:48 there are many ways that we can show our gratitude.
00:43:50 But certainly these two:
00:43:52 Our study of God’s Word and applying the suggestions to improve our ministry
00:43:56 are two ways that we can certainly implement.
00:43:59 So in imitation of Jesus, Jeremiah,
00:44:04 many other faithful Witnesses of Jehovah,
00:44:06 may we do what we can to show that we are invested,
00:44:10 that we show our love for God and our love for people
00:44:14 as we appreciatively carry out our commission to preach the good news.
00:44:20 “Love Never Fails”!
00:44:23 was the theme of last year’s conventions.
00:44:26 Twenty-four international conventions were held in different parts of the earth.
00:44:31 As we’ll see in the following report,
00:44:34 our international conventions
00:44:36 showcased the love and unity of Jehovah’s people,
00:44:40 and they provided a tremendous witness.
00:44:47 Jesus said that the identifying mark
00:44:50 of true Christians would be
00:44:52 their love for one another.
00:44:54 This was especially evident
00:44:56 at our 2019 “Love Never Fails”! International Conventions.
00:45:09 I never expected the welcome that we received.
00:45:12 There were over 200 brothers in the airport.
00:45:17 For me, it’s like I’m in Paradise already because of the love I feel here.
00:45:22 Wherever I turn, there’s love.
00:45:25 As I walked around the corner,
00:45:28 the reception of the friends, the way they embraced me,
00:45:31 was something that I could not have expected.
00:45:33 No one could’ve even described it to me.
00:45:47 Mexico has a lot of different cultures.
00:45:49 But here in this stadium,
00:45:51 we are one people united by love,
00:45:54 serving Jehovah.
00:45:56 That’s unique, it’s wonderful,
00:45:58 and it’s all thanks to love.
00:46:01 It doesn’t matter where we come from or what language we speak.
00:46:05 The language here is love.
00:46:12 Our love of neighbor motivated us to share in a global preaching campaign.
00:46:18 Foreign delegates worked shoulder to shoulder
00:46:20 with hosts from the local city
00:46:22 to invite millions of people from around the world
00:46:26 to one of the 24 international conventions.
00:46:31 This gave our brothers and sisters from different parts of the globe
00:46:35 an opportunity to get to know each other,
00:46:38 united by the common goal of spreading the good news to everyone they met.
00:46:44 I worked in field service with a sister
00:46:46 who used to study the Bible with a Brazilian woman.
00:46:49 The sister had prayed to send a Brazilian sister to accompany her.
00:46:54 When we visited the woman together,
00:46:56 she could see the love we have between us
00:46:59 and the efforts we made to come so far
00:47:02 to attend the convention here in Denmark.
00:47:04 Over a million people attended
00:47:07 the international conventions in many different languages.
00:47:11 Both foreign and local delegates as well as newly interested ones
00:47:15 were able to learn firsthand how love never fails.
00:47:20 “Clothe yourselves with love,
00:47:24 for it is a perfect bond of union.”
00:47:27 First, love identifies us.
00:47:32 Humility —that’s love in action.
00:47:36 Loyal love is a beautiful aspect
00:47:38 of Jehovah’s personality.
00:47:41 Well, Jesus made it simple, didn’t he?
00:47:44 He said: ‘Look for the love.
00:47:47 Look for the love, and you’ll find the right religion.’
00:47:53 Christian love has power.
00:47:55 It can reach hearts in ways
00:47:57 that the spoken word cannot.
00:48:00 But, really, what other group of persons on earth
00:48:04 are interested in discussing love that doesn’t fail?
00:48:09 When someone sees us,
00:48:11 they should see a loving individual.
00:48:13 When they see any one of us
00:48:16 who are servants of Jehovah,
00:48:19 then they should see love.
00:48:26 In addition to spending time in the ministry, activities were planned
00:48:30 so that delegates could get to know
00:48:32 their brothers better.
00:48:40 This gave delegates the opportunity to learn about the culture
00:48:44 and our spiritual heritage in the host country.
00:48:49 In some cities, they visited exhibits and locations
00:48:54 where previously our faith and love had been tested.
00:48:57 For example, delegates in Berlin had the opportunity to visit
00:49:02 Sachsenhausen concentration camp
00:49:04 where many of our brothers were imprisoned
00:49:07 during World War II.
00:49:10 I thought it was especially amazing,
00:49:12 despite the circumstances those brothers and sisters faced,
00:49:15 that even their persecutors
00:49:17 had to recognize the true identifying mark of Christianity
00:49:20 —of love.
00:49:24 This visit showed the faithful endurance our brothers and sisters
00:49:27 demonstrated under vicious persecution
00:49:30 and the love they had for Jehovah
00:49:33 –a fitting example of love that never fails.
00:49:38 Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate Jehovah’s Witnesses;
00:49:43 he called them a brood.
00:49:46 But instead, Jehovah’s Witnesses are still here,
00:49:50 proving that Christian love never fails.
00:49:57 Another example of faith and endurance was seen in Seoul, Korea.
00:50:05 Since 1953, young Korean brothers had been imprisoned
00:50:10 for refusing military service.
00:50:13 Altogether,
00:50:15 over 19,000 brothers who refused to compromise their faith
00:50:20 spent nearly 37,000 years in prison.
00:50:24 Delegates were able to visit a neutrality exhibition to learn more
00:50:29 about the strong faith and unwavering courage
00:50:32 these young brothers displayed.
00:50:35 On February 28, 2019,
00:50:39 the last of our imprisoned brothers was released.
00:50:44 Because I received a not-guilty verdict just two weeks ago,
00:50:49 I was able to attend this international convention.
00:50:52 I am so grateful to Jehovah.
00:50:56 My son receiving this acquittal enabled him to attend this convention.
00:51:01 We never imagined this would be possible.
00:51:04 What a joy it was for these brothers to attend
00:51:07 this historic international convention alongside their families
00:51:12 and thousands of foreign delegates!
00:51:16 Just being able to sit next to my son for the convention
00:51:18 completely fills my heart.
00:51:31 Despite an ongoing economic crisis,
00:51:34 many delegates from Venezuela
00:51:37 were able to attend the international convention
00:51:39 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
00:51:43 Coming from Venezuela,
00:51:45 it’s difficult to earn a living or save money.
00:51:48 We had to sell our electronic devices and work long hours to be here.
00:51:52 But these sacrifices 
00:51:54 will always be worth it.
00:52:01 The love we show to our brothers is possible
00:52:04 because of the love Jehovah shows us.
00:52:07 An expression of his love to us comes in the form of his Word, the Bible.
00:52:13 In Copenhagen, Denmark,
00:52:15 delegates from Iceland were delighted to receive a special gift.
00:52:20 We are happy to announce the release
00:52:23 of the Icelandic New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:52:34 Additionally, at several 2019 international conventions,
00:52:39 our brothers received the revised New World Translation 
00:52:44 in the language of their heart.
00:53:19 I can really feel the love from Jehovah.
00:53:22 He’s given us this wonderful gift
00:53:24 because he wants us to know that the words in this book
00:53:28 are from him.
00:53:31 The conventions also gave thousands the opportunity
00:53:34 to express their love for Jehovah
00:53:36 by symbolizing their dedication to him
00:53:39 through baptism.
00:53:45 The love among our brothers was evident to onlookers as well.
00:53:49 The police directing traffic
00:53:51 had less work than they normally do.
00:53:54 The atmosphere was so contagious that they started greeting
00:53:58 foreign and local delegates.
00:54:00 They were so happy.
00:54:03 They said: “This country does not need more police.
00:54:07 What it needs is more Jehovah’s Witnesses!”
00:54:11 Our 2019 international conventions have given us
00:54:16 an opportunity to demonstrate how Jehovah’s love
00:54:19 motivates us to love.
00:54:23 Well, as we approach the end of this system of things,
00:54:26 we’re going to need love more than ever before.
00:54:30 Of course, we need loyalty;
00:54:32 of course, we need endurance;
00:54:35 and, of course, we’re going to sing that song of courage.
00:54:39 But remember what else we want
00:54:42 —Jehovah’s loyal love!
00:54:45 May we be determined to imitate Him in letting
00:54:49 our love never ever fail,
00:54:55 all to Jehovah’s glory.
00:55:05 Our program has focused
00:55:07 on meeting the challenge of bearing thorough witness.
00:55:11 Before we close, here’s the video postcard
00:55:14 of our Aymara-speaking brothers and sisters in Bolivia.
00:55:19 This South American country is home to about 28,500 publishers
00:55:23 and nearly 7,000 pioneers.
00:55:28 Bolivia officially recognizes Spanish
00:55:31 and 36 indigenous languages, including Aymara.
00:55:35 Of the country’s 11 million people,
00:55:37 about 1.6 million speak Aymara.
00:55:41 This is the remote translation office in the city of El Alto.
00:55:46 Twenty translators are helping
00:55:48 to provide Bible-based literature in the Aymara language.
00:55:53 In 2017,
00:55:55 the New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures 
00:55:58 was released in Aymara.
00:56:00 Most of the Aymara-speaking territory
00:56:03 surrounds beautiful Lake Titicaca
00:56:06 and includes parts of Bolivia and Peru.
00:56:09 Reaching those in isolated villages involves
00:56:12 hours of traveling and walking.
00:56:15 The response is encouraging.
00:56:18 The Aymara people respect God’s Word
00:56:21 and highly appreciate spiritual discussions.
00:56:24 Today, there are 31 Aymara congregations
00:56:28 and 14 Aymara-language groups in Bolivia.
00:56:32 The Copacabana Aymara Congregation is located
00:56:36 at an altitude of 3,800 meters,
00:56:40 or nearly 12,500 feet.
00:56:43 The congregation includes this isolated group
00:56:46 located about an hour and a half from Copacabana.
00:56:51 Copacabana is a very popular tourist spot.
00:56:55 People come from around the world to see Andean culture
00:56:58 and beautiful Lake Titicaca.
00:57:01 The congregation engages
00:57:02 in many forms of public witnessing.
00:57:06 Their territory even includes an island in the middle of the lake.
00:57:11 Our brothers and sisters
00:57:13 of the Copacabana Aymara Congregation
00:57:16 send you their warm Christian love and greetings.
00:57:20 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:57:24 this is JW Broadcasting.
