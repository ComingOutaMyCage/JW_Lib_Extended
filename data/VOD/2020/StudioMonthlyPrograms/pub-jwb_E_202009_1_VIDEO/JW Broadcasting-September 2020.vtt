WEBVTT

00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,953
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:08,424
This month we will discuss
how to meet the challenge

00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,826
of bearing “thorough witness.”

00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:13,829
Is your territory difficult to reach?

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,332
Do language and cultural differences
make you apprehensive?

00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,736
That’s what these publishers faced

00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:23,272
when they moved
to where the need is greater.

00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,275
We’ll learn how they
stepped up to the challenge.

00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,513
This sister embraced the truth
during a time of violent division

00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:33,515
in Northern Ireland.

00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:38,087
How did she muster up the courage
to preach to everyone in her community?

00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,923
We’ll see how Jehovah helped her.

00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,327
And our new music video
reminds us that absolutely nothing

00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:48,297
can separate us from God’s love.

00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:52,568
All this and more on JW Broadcasting.

00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:15,624
Imagine the astonished look
on the faces of the apostles.

00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,127
The resurrected Jesus stands before them

00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,129
on the Mount of Olives.

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,332
Just before he disappears into the clouds,

00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,435
Jesus makes this profound declaration,

00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:29,404
as recorded at Acts 1:8:

00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:35,010
“You will receive power
when the holy spirit comes upon you,

00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,113
“and you will be
witnesses of me in Jerusalem,

00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:40,582
“in all Judea and Samaria,

00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:45,154
and to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,523
What an assignment!

00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,659
They were to preach the good news
of God’s Kingdom

00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,795
throughout the earth.

00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,931
Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed

00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:59,134
and wondered how
such a small band of preachers

00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:02,037
could ever get this work done.

00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:06,441
Ten days later, they received
the promised holy spirit,

00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,710
and they got to work.

00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,880
True, they faced many challenges.

00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,516
But that did not stop them.

00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:17,219
Three years passed,
and the preaching work

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,222
was expanded to include Gentiles.

00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,827
We can read the moving account
in Acts chapter 10.

00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,663
First, an angel of God appears

00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,966
to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.

00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:34,269
Then, Peter responds
to the leadings of God’s spirit

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,839
to go to the officer’s home.

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,943
There, Peter gives
a thorough witness about Jesus

00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,945
not only to Cornelius

00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:46,081
but also to his family and friends.

00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,684
As he concludes his discourse,

00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:53,689
Peter explains the commission
he received to be an evangelizer.

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,125
Let’s open to Acts 10:42,

00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:59,394
and note the two main aspects

00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:02,064
of the preaching work started by Jesus:

00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:06,735
“Also, he ordered us to preach to the people

00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:09,404
“and to give a thorough witness

00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,773
“that this is the one decreed by God

00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,110
to be judge of the living and the dead.”

00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:18,580
First, Jesus commanded his disciples

00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,782
“to preach to the people.”

00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,987
In addition, they were
“to give a thorough witness.”

00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:29,925
The disciples were to search out
honesthearted, deserving ones.

00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:33,996
That would require a thorough coverage
of their territory.

00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,832
In spite of vicious persecution,

00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,968
Christians in the first century
obeyed Jesus’ command

00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,405
to preach and to bear thorough witness.

00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:45,941
And by about 60 of our Common Era,

00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:50,479
less than 30 years after the Christians
had received their commission,

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,682
Paul could write
to the congregation in Colossae

00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:58,587
that the good news had been
“preached in all creation under heaven.”

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,259
What a testimony to the power
of God’s holy spirit

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,862
and the faith, zeal,

00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,865
and determination of those early disciples!

00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:15,270
In the late 1800’s,
a small group of Bible students

00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:19,174
rose to the challenge
of bearing thorough witness.

00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:23,612
An article in the April 1881 issue
of Zion’s Watch Tower

00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,681
had the thrilling title

00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,017
“Wanted 1,000 Preachers.”

00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:33,322
Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses
are bearing witness

00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:36,224
in 240 lands.

00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:39,027
But doing so has its challenges.

00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:43,398
What are some of those challenges,
and what can we do to meet them?

00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,769
Many of our brothers face
the challenge of long distances,

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,839
climate extremes, rough terrain,

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,142
and poor travel conditions.

00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,045
In some areas, just getting
to meet people

00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,047
is a challenge.

00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:03,518
To add to the challenge,
Revelation 14:6 reminds us

00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,520
that the good news would be declared

00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,058
“to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.”

00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,528
This can require learning a new language

00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,665
and understanding
different religious, ethnic,

00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,201
and cultural backgrounds.

00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,437
It can mean coping
with unresponsive territories,

00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:26,308
apathy, and poor living conditions.

00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,810
Jesus warned that opposers would try

00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:32,247
to hinder or stop the preaching work.

00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,317
No doubt you are facing
some form of challenge

00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,552
in your local territory.

00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,288
We cannot begin to give possible solutions

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,558
to all the obstacles we face today.

00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:48,430
But it is helpful to learn how others
are coping with their challenges,

00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,299
and this can stimulate our thinking

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,203
to identify ways to meet our challenges.

00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:59,408
Let’s focus on three Bible principles
that will help us

00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,511
to carry out our ministry successfully:

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,416
(1) Trust in Jehovah,

00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,652
(2) be flexible,

00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,455
and (3) stay focused.

00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,526
How can trusting in Jehovah help us?

00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,095
Consider an example.

00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:24,566
During the 1990’s,
Jehovah’s Witnesses in France

00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:28,170
endured an avalanche
of negative media reports.

00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,739
As a result of these vicious attacks,

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,041
some brothers lost their jobs,

00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:36,411
Witness children were taunted at school,

00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:40,449
preaching became extremely difficult
in some areas.

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,451
How did they cope?

00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:46,455
The turning point came in January 1999.

00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,558
The Governing Body approved
a special campaign

00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,027
to distribute a magazine-size tract

00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:55,597
that exposed all of the accusations as false.

00:06:56,265 --> 00:07:00,635
Beginning early one Friday morning,
Witnesses throughout France

00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:03,472
distributed 12 million copies of the tract

00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,074
in just three days.

00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,510
This campaign gave them renewed strength

00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,246
and boldness to preach.

00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,515
In the 19 years that followed,

00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,119
there was a continuous increase
in the number of publishers

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,287
and the ranks of regular pioneers

00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:22,290
swelled to over 15,000.

00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:27,996
If you constantly face a barrage
of negative media reports,

00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:32,634
does this mean that you need
a special campaign to meet the challenge?

00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,669
Not necessarily.

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,706
Although the campaign was a stimulus,

00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,908
brothers and sisters in France said

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,645
that what really gave them
strength and boldness

00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:47,149
were the words of 2 Chronicles 32:8.

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,451
Let’s read it.

00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:53,188
The setting is in the time
of King Hezekiah of Judah.

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,024
The people were beaten down

00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,828
by the repeated threats
and taunts of the Assyrians.

00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:02,898
What strengthened them?

00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,102
Speaking about the king of Assyria,
King Hezekiah declared:

00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:11,473
“With him is an arm of flesh,

00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:15,477
“but with us is Jehovah our God to help us

00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,612
and to fight our battles.”

00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:19,781
What was the result?

00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:25,320
“The people were strengthened
by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.”

00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:29,724
Just hearing this reminder
that Jehovah would help them

00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,694
was enough to strengthen the Jews.

00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,830
Jehovah took action and sent an angel

00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:38,433
to destroy the enemy army.

00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:42,571
Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?

00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:46,708
Note what we read at Revelation 14:6:

00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:50,879
“I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,149
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,318
“to those who dwell on the earth,

00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,020
“to every nation and tribe

00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:01,856
and tongue and people.”

00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,726
Be sensitive to angelic direction

00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,562
and the leadings of God’s holy spirit.

00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:11,766
If you feel moved to make that one last call

00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:15,870
or to speak to the person
next to you on the bus, do it!

00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,439
Speak up.

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,408
It may well be
that an angel is directing you

00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:24,713
to one who is “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:28,683
Now let’s consider the second Bible principle

00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,620
that will help us to bear thorough witness:

00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,888
Be flexible.

00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:37,993
Sometimes just getting to talk to people
can be a challenge.

00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,764
To overcome this obstacle,
we need to be flexible.

00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,735
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi
have served in territories

00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,871
that are as different as night and day.

00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:52,941
Recently, they visited our studio.

00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,477
Listen as they tell us how they have learned

00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:59,481
to meet the challenges
of bearing thorough witness.

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,051
Takanori and Yumi,

00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,086
welcome to our studio!

00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,755
Thank you for inviting us.

00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,324
And we’re very happy to have you here.

00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,826
Takanori, you and I go back a long way.

00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:17,399
I still remember when you came
into Japan Bethel back in 1977,

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,636
and we served in the same congregation
for a number of years.

00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:25,740
But then in 1990, you had
a big change in your life.

00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,742
Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:30,278
Yes, my twin brother,

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,015
Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.

00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,352
To our surprise, we were assigned

00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:39,487
to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.

00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,556
That was a big change!

00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,994
And here you are working
in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.

00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,763
During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,

00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:51,533
I understand that you served
in the missionary field,

00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,536
in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:57,238
So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,476
Takanori and I were married
in September 1993,

00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,579
and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,250
Adapting to remote territories such as this
was a challenge.

00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,220
So in order to bear thorough witness,

00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:15,957
what kind of challenges
did you have to overcome?

00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,027
The people of Papua New Guinea
are very friendly.

00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,497
They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:24,833
It was easy to relax,

00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,068
speak to them face-to-face,

00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:31,506
to read the Scriptures together,
and reason with them.

00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,575
Those don’t sound like challenges.

00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,643
Did you face any obstacles?

00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:38,713
When we preached in the villages,

00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:41,182
the response of the local people

00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,954
often depended on the response
of the village chief.

00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,958
If he listened,
almost the whole village listened.

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,927
But if his response was negative,

00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:56,765
the people would walk away
and hide in the bush.

00:11:56,766 --> 00:12:00,668
So we would always show respect

00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:03,204
and approach the village chief first.

00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:08,476
This often moved him
to view our visit with favor.

00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,647
The challenge in the cities
was mainly security.

00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,818
It wasn’t safe for us to go
into some areas alone

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,087
or to visit homes regularly.

00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:23,525
So we would ask our Bible students
to come to the Kingdom Hall

00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:27,028
for their study before the meeting.

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,533
That was a good way to encourage them
to attend meetings.

00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:35,303
Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed
your service in Papua New Guinea.

00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:38,807
But now you’re serving as special pioneers
in the Maihama Congregation

00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,610
just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:47,415
So you went from a territory
where people have deep respect for the Bible

00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:51,986
to a land where less than 1 percent
of the people claim to be Christian.

00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,423
So, what other kind of differences
did you find

00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:59,561
between your territory in Japan now
and your missionary territory?

00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:02,464
Oh, it’s very different.

00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:05,767
Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,

00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,136
and 70 percent of the homes

00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:11,873
are in high-security apartment buildings.

00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,710
We have to stand in the lobby
in front of the doorman,

00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,913
push a button, and speak to a camera.

00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,116
Coming from Papua New Guinea,

00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:24,953
we found it challenging
to work this territory.

00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:29,724
We were used to friendly discussions
face-to-face.

00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,927
Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:37,632
But we have learned
to view the camera as our friend.

00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,167
As your friend?

00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:42,904
I think most of us find it challenging
to speak to a camera.

00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,673
So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:49,210
We know that as soon as we push the button,

00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,847
our face shows up on a screen
inside of the apartment.

00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:56,551
We stand an arm’s length from the camera

00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,587
so that our face is framed nicely.

00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,457
And we adjust our volume accordingly,

00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,328
taking into consideration the doorman
and others who may be listening.

00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,198
We say our greeting

00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,801
about two seconds after we push the button,

00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:17,572
just when we know
that they are looking at the monitor.

00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,875
Our friendly greeting and warm smile

00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:24,345
makes them feel like we
can actually see their face.

00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,984
We prepare a specific appealing introduction

00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:34,455
and show them respect and consideration.

00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:39,460
The people in our territory
like to be viewed as successful,

00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,863
not as people who have problems.

00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,667
So we try to focus on positive subjects.

00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:48,403
We prepare a variety of subjects

00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,440
so that they don’t hear
the same message over and over.

00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:58,212
Like many people, Japanese do not like
to be put on the spot.

00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:03,217
So instead of asking a question
and waiting for them to answer,

00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:07,021
we use the teaching method of our tracts

00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:10,158
and give three possible answers
for them to choose from.

00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,029
Well, have you had positive results
from this intercom preaching?

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,099
Since we started to use this method,

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,202
the number of not-at-homes has decreased.

00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:24,606
And also, when we meet people on the street,

00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,942
sometimes they say they know us

00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:31,179
because they saw us on their intercom.

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,780
That was excellent!

00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,751
And thank you, Takanori and Yumi,
for sharing with us

00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,754
how you have met the challenge
of bearing thorough witness

00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,256
in a variety of territories.

00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:47,829
First Corinthians 9:22, 23

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,831
—let’s read it.

00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,533
“I have become all things

00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,702
“to people of all sorts,

00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,773
“so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,775
“But I do all things

00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,810
“for the sake of the good news,

00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,780
in order to share it with others.”

00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,282
“Become all things.”

00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,951
“Do all things.”

00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:12,854
In other words, be flexible.

00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,324
Apply the suggestions
in the meeting workbook.

00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:20,528
Get well-acquainted with each tool
in the Teaching Toolbox.

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,131
Observe how experienced publishers

00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,933
and pioneers use those tools.

00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,803
Understand the feelings and circumstances

00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:31,039
of people in the territory.

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,044
Even in the same territory,
we may need to use a variety of approaches.

00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:38,746
For example, about 40 percent

00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,883
of the apartment buildings
in the Takahashi’s territory

00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,852
do not allow the Witnesses
to enter the lobby,

00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:49,791
so they do public and informal witnessing
to reach those people.

00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:53,094
Now let’s consider the third Bible principle:

00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,196
Stay focused.

00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,799
At Matthew 6:22, Jesus said:

00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,869
“The lamp of the body is the eye.

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,539
“If, then, your eye is focused,

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,742
your whole body will be bright.”

00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,314
Keeping our eye focused means
keeping our life simple

00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:17,018
in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.

00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,755
Distractions take our attention
and energy away

00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,858
from our responsibility
to bear thorough witness.

00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,296
Before we can teach those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life,”

00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,565
we have to find them.

00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:34,969
We leave no stone unturned
as we search for them at their homes,

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,405
on the streets, in parks,

00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:40,975
in stores, and at the workplace.

00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:45,480
There’s no on/off switch
for our preaching work.

00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,150
Our “preaching switch” must be on

00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,819
at all times.

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,256
Not only do we look
for opportunities to preach

00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:58,359
but we also make opportunities.

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,329
What if our efforts to find interested ones

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,331
are not fruitful?

00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,800
Jesus did not say that every human

00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:08,836
must become a disciple before the end comes.

00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,306
Rather, he said that the end will come

00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:16,477
after the good news has been preached
in all the inhabited earth

00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:20,348
and a witness has been given
to all the nations.

00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,051
The apostle Paul stayed
focused on his ministry.

00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:27,588
May we imitate his positive attitude

00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:31,459
expressed at Acts 20:24:

00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:36,164
“Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life

00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,232
“of any importance to me,

00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,235
“if only I may finish my course

00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:44,705
“and the ministry that I received
from the Lord Jesus,

00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,242
“to bear thorough witness to the good news

00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:52,380
of the undeserved kindness of God.”

00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:57,118
The opportunity to bear thorough witness
will soon be over.

00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,555
May we use the remaining time effectively

00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,924
to search for deserving ones

00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:06,394
and to teach them the truth.

00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,463
Imitate the faith of Hezekiah,

00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,933
and trust in Jehovah;

00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,502
learn from the apostle Paul,

00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:16,504
and be flexible;

00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:19,240
obey Jesus’ direction,

00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,642
and stay focused.

00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:24,846
Then you too can meet the challenge

00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,348
of bearing “thorough witness.”

00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,586
Another challenge of bearing thorough witness

00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,156
is preaching in the midst of civil unrest.

00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,725
Starting in the 1960’s,

00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,927
our brothers in Northern Ireland

00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,797
endured 30 violent years

00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,166
known as the “Troubles.”

00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:49,403
Kay Harrigan learned the truth
during those difficult times.

00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:53,808
Listen as Kay describes
how she was drawn to the truth

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,544
and how it changed her life.

00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:08,389
Trusting in Jehovah
helped Kay overcome her fears.

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,258
What blessings did she receive?

00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:16,263
Kay said that she has the happiness
of bringing good news to everyone.

00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:22,369
Since 2013,
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,308
has prepared brothers and sisters
to serve where there is a greater need.

00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,877
Even with this training, however,

00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:33,747
graduates sometimes find
their assignments challenging.

00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:37,585
We’ll see that
in our next segment from Tanzania.

00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,288
I wanted to help the deaf

00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,691
so that they too can know Jehovah.

00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:47,628
So I decided to move
to a sign-language territory:

00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,431
the sign-language group in Dar es Salaam.

00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:55,769
We had to travel by bus,
and sometimes we traveled far

00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,839
(stuck in a traffic jam
for two to three hours),

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,841
and it was expensive.

00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,113
I still remember my early days in service

00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:07,881
with the sign-language group.

00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,117
I was very inexperienced with the language,

00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:14,855
and one day, my service partner
asked me to conduct her Bible study.

00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:20,060
Every time I tried to talk
to the student, argh, she didn’t understand.

00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:25,866
As I kept trying, she became
more and more frustrated with me,

00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,335
and I started to feel discouraged.

00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,839
I wanted to help, but I was powerless.

00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,476
I felt bad.

00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:38,379
I told myself: ‘I still don’t know the deaf.

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,748
‘I still don’t know sign language.

00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,550
‘Why has Jehovah brought me into this field

00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,153
in which I am not able to help the deaf?’

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,593
I was invited
to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,596
in 2014, from September to November.

00:26:56,231 --> 00:27:01,068
After graduating, I received
an assignment in sign language again.

00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,271
Jehovah truly helped me so much.

00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:08,208
That was exactly
the encouragement I needed to persevere

00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,612
in learning the language
and becoming more effective in my assignment.

00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:14,915
I was able to conduct my own Bible studies,

00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,718
and they could really understand me now.

00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:22,022
When we started,
there were two baptized deaf publishers,

00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,024
but now there are over ten.

00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:28,295
I’ve had the opportunity to help
three deaf people to make progress,

00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:32,066
to dedicate themselves to Jehovah,
and to get baptized.

00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,769
The training I received at the school
is still helping me now

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,139
in my new assignment
at the translation office,

00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,909
where I serve together with my husband.

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,578
We are joyful because we know
that through this work,

00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,881
many deaf people
will receive publications in their language

00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:51,618
and this will bring about
an increase in this territory.

00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:56,724
I graduated from the School

00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:59,560
for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015.

00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:03,230
And it was a privilege
to receive the assignment

00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:06,900
to go help the Maasai
to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,606
Traveling is difficult.

00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,142
Sometimes I travel by vehicle,

00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:18,779
but sometimes there are areas
in which there are no vehicles,

00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,149
so I’m forced to walk.

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,085
Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle

00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:28,622
to reach many more people.

00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,925
But still, transportation
is a difficult part of it:

00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:34,595
there are valleys, there are mountains,

00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:37,598
there are uphills, there are downhills.

00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,467
So transportation is difficult.

00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,937
When I finally reached the territory,

00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:46,940
I was able to find the Maasai.

00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:49,443
I was apprehensive about their reaction

00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:51,812
because I know their culture;

00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,148
they don’t know Jehovah.

00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,318
So I wondered what would happen
when I reached their territory.

00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,354
During that stressful time,

00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:03,290
I prayed to Jehovah;

00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,626
I read his Word, the Bible;

00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:10,731
I meditated on accounts of our brothers
and sisters mentioned in the Bible;

00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:14,835
and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.

00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,137
I was able to return to them,

00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:20,174
make return visits, and start Bible studies.

00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,643
So the results have been good.

00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,711
I am happy

00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:27,381
that after starting studies,

00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:30,818
some started taking steps
and attending meetings.

00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:33,187
They later made good progress,

00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,056
and now some of them
are our brothers and sisters.

00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:40,527
They dedicated themselves and were baptized.

00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,330
I feel so much joy.

00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:46,333
Jehovah has given me
the strength and the ability

00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,236
to be used to further the preaching
of the good news

00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:52,673
and to help the Maasai spiritually.

00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,812
Sabina said that she was discouraged.

00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:01,114
Saitoti was stressed.

00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:04,618
Have you ever felt that way
about your ministry?

00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,820
What helped them?

00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,323
Sabina persevered.

00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:12,025
She became proficient in sign language

00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:16,563
and had the joy of helping
several deaf ones learn the truth.

00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:20,100
Saitoti relied on prayer and meditation.

00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:24,738
Jehovah gave him the strength
to bear witness to the Maasai.

00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,774
And we saw the encouraging results.

00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,944
As our new music video shows,

00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:35,716
we can be convinced
that Jehovah will always be with his people,

00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:38,118
no matter what we face.

00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:56,036
You have been praying.
You have been preaching.

00:30:56,037 --> 00:31:01,909
You have been loyal
through ev’rything.

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,881
And though we don’t see
all the trials you face,

00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:12,853
Know that Jehovah’s seeing it all.

00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:17,057
So when you stand
in front of court officials,

00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,059
You are not alone.

00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:25,365
Your example speaks to all of us,
And Jehovah knows.

00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,868
‘For I am convinced

00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:36,410
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God’s love.’

00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:39,613
‘For I am convinced

00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:47,988
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God’s love.’

00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:56,396
So please be convinced
That you are in God’s love.

00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:12,412
You have been faithful.
You have not wavered.

00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:17,150
You looked to Jehovah
through all the storms.

00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:24,057
And though enemies try
and stop the good news,

00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:28,895
Know that you have
much more backing you.

00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:33,066
So when you stand
in front of court officials,

00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,135
You are not alone.

00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:41,341
Your example speaks to all of us,
And Jehovah knows.

00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:43,944
‘For I am convinced

00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:52,519
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God’s love.’

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,689
‘For I am convinced

00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:03,764
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God’s love.’

00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:12,105
So please be convinced
That you are in God’s love.

00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:18,011
Please know you are.

00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:30,190
It is written:
‘You would suffer for the One you love’—

00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:34,127
Oh, the God you love.

00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:42,035
‘But on the contrary,
you are coming off victorious’—

00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:45,005
Oh, victorious.

00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,375
‘So I am convinced

00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:56,483
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God’s love.’

00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:00,053
‘For I am convinced

00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:08,662
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God’s love.’

00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,865
‘For I am convinced

00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:20,240
That death nor life nor governments
will separate us from God’s love.’

00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:23,844
‘For I am convinced

00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:32,018
That things to come nor powers
can separate us from God’s love.’

00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:39,593
So please be convinced
That you are in God’s love.

00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,530
Showing love and concern for people

00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:47,000
is a vital element
in bearing thorough witness.

00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,470
This was the subject
of a recent Morning Worship program

00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,873
conducted by Brother William Turner,

00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:55,575
and we’re happy to share it with you.

00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:59,579
His theme is “Make Known ‘the Good News.’”

00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:03,784
“How does it make you feel,

00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:06,720
“knowing God’s support is real,

00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:08,722
“and that he’s entrusted [us]

00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:10,724
to do the work we do?”

00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:12,826
We know that song.

00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:15,362
We love that song.

00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,132
But have you ever stopped
to meditate on the lyrics?

00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:21,635
How do we feel?

00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:25,105
Because, really,
it’s a tremendous, amazing privilege

00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,941
that Jehovah has entrusted to his people

00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:31,978
—the work of Kingdom preaching
and disciple-making.

00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:35,849
Now, while the work at Bethel
contributes to the preaching work

00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,318
in a very precious and unique way,

00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:41,421
we still recognize it’s quite special

00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:44,491
to be able to assist someone in the ministry

00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:48,195
and watch them progress
to the point of making a dedication

00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,565
and symbolizing that by water baptism.

00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,667
Our text comments mention the qualities

00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:57,237
of gratitude and undeserved kindness.

00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,239
And these are good qualities

00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,775
because they’re qualities that motivate us,

00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,044
that move us to action,

00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:06,479
that touch our emotions.

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,082
Why is this emotional investment

00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,620
so important when it comes to our ministry?

00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,689
Well, think, for example,

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,292
of our greatest Teacher and Preacher

00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:22,329
who ever walked the earth,
and that is Jesus Christ.

00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,332
Turn with me in your Bibles, please,
to Luke chapter 19,

00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:30,937
and we’ll just take a look at one instance

00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,908
of how Jesus demonstrated
this love and concern.

00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,745
Luke 19:41

00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:46,086
says: “And when he
[that is, Jesus] got nearby,

00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:50,357
“he viewed the city [Jerusalem]

00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:52,692
and wept over it.”

00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:55,729
How interesting!

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,233
Jesus’ heart was filled with so much emotion

00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:05,105
that his eyes brimmed over with tears
when he contemplated the people,

00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,774
their rejection of the message,

00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,910
the siege that was to follow.

00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,012
Doesn’t that show his love for people?

00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:15,048
And obviously,
that love was made evident

00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:17,951
the entire time
that he was here on the earth.

00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,086
Now, we may not give way to tears

00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:24,391
every time we go into our territory
and engage in the ministry,

00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:27,694
but certainly we want
to imitate Jesus’ example,

00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:32,465
because it’s so vital that we have
and demonstrate love for people.

00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:37,137
It reminds me of a conversation I had
with a missionary sister some time ago,

00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,673
and at the time,
she was revealing her personal circumstances.

00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,675
And she felt that at that time

00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,078
she could comfortably handle
ten Bible studies.

00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,546
So I asked her how things were going.

00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,315
She said, “Well, actually I have 20.”

00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,317
She said, “I was able to get rid of six.”

00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,254
She said,
“But I just can’t turn over these last four.”

00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:57,657
She said, “They’re such a part of my life;

00:37:57,658 --> 00:38:00,327
I just can’t let them go.”

00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:03,129
Well, it sounds like a good problem to have.

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,099
But doesn’t it highlight her love for people?

00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,936
She was emotionally invested.

00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:12,472
Now, we also have to admit

00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:15,976
that while preaching is a wonderful work,

00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:20,981
actually carrying it out
is not always easy to do.

00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:24,684
Perhaps at times we may feel
like the prophet Jeremiah.

00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:27,053
You recall when he
was commissioned as a prophet,

00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,890
he gave Jehovah a number of reasons
why he shouldn’t be selected.

00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:35,795
He was too shy, too young,
wasn’t able to speak well.

00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:37,831
And then once he got into his assignment

00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,367
and the opposition and the ridicule started

00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:42,369
—well, let’s take note of his feelings.

00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,871
Turn with me, please,
to Jeremiah chapter 20,

00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:52,345
Jeremiah chapter 20.

00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:54,881
We’ll begin with the B  part of verse 8:

00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,219
“For me the word of Jehovah

00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,590
“has been the cause of insults
and jeering all day long.

00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,961
“So I said:
‘I am not going to make mention of him,

00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:11,831
and I will speak no more in his name.’”

00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:17,737
Have you ever had times
when you felt like Jeremiah,

00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,840
when you just didn’t have the desire

00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:24,544
or feel like speaking
to others about Jehovah?

00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:27,247
And maybe it was for similar reasons:

00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:30,784
We’re shy; we feel nervous;

00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,186
people in the territory are indifferent.

00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,992
Or could it just be that we’re just tired?

00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:43,997
The energy that we feel we need,
we just don’t have it.

00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:47,000
Is it normal to feel this way at times?

00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,002
Absolutely.

00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:52,305
But let’s take note
of what Jeremiah says next.

00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,474
Let’s finish verse 9.

00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,843
He says:
“But in my heart

00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:01,114
“it became like a burning fire
shut up in my bones,

00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,716
“and I was tired of holding it in;

00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:06,753
I could no longer endure it.”

00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:09,722
You notice,
it was Jeremiah’s love for Jehovah,

00:40:09,723 --> 00:40:12,992
his zeal for the truth,
his strong spirituality

00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:17,864
—all of these were things
that were able to help him remain invested

00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:22,569
and be able to overcome
any temporary discouragement

00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,839
that he might have been feeling at that time.

00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,475
So, what can help us to stay invested

00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:31,311
and to maintain our love for people?

00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:34,247
Well, there are many ways,
but we’ll discuss two.

00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:37,750
First, Jeremiah’s example shows us

00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:40,487
that there is never a substitute

00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:43,123
for the study of God’s Word.

00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:44,390
Did you notice,

00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:49,028
What was that ‘burning fire
shut up in his bones’?

00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,666
Verse 8 tells us
it was “the word of Jehovah.”

00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:56,536
So it was Jeremiah’s appreciation

00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,205
for the importance of his message

00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,241
that made him responsive

00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:06,212
to the encouragement
he received when he read God’s Word.

00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,115
And it works the same for us as well.

00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:14,120
Study of God’s Word
helps to reinforce our love for Jehovah.

00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:16,823
It’s a constant reminder
that we’re living in the last days,

00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,825
that we’re deep in the time of the end,

00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:21,127
and that we need to do
all that we can to find

00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:25,064
those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:29,035
Yes, it is natural
that we are going to experience

00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:31,437
discouragement from time to time,

00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,840
but when we pray to Jehovah for help,

00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:37,644
you see, if his Word is in our hearts,

00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:41,181
then Jehovah can freely impart
his holy spirit to us.

00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:43,183
He can give us what we need

00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:46,586
to be bold preachers of the good news

00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,889
and be productive in our ministry.

00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,692
Now, the second thing that can help us

00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:56,296
is applying the suggestions
that are given to us

00:41:56,297 --> 00:42:00,533
by the slave to help us improve our ministry.

00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:04,537
Now, perhaps in the past, 
preaching may have been difficult,

00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:07,340
maybe just because of pressure
we put upon ourselves.

00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:11,711
Perhaps we may have felt that we
had to have the perfect presentation

00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:15,181
or we had to place
a certain amount of literature.

00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:17,183
But how loving it is that we see

00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:20,320
that with the various adjustments
that have been made in our ministry,

00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:23,389
well, hopefully some
of that anxiety has been lifted

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,927
because now we know
our focus is on starting conversations!

00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:30,663
And with the help of prayer and God’s spirit,

00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:35,168
we can see how that
just naturally progresses into a witness.

00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:37,804
If we just think back for a moment
to the example of Jesus,

00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,341
we can only imagine
how many preaching opportunities

00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:46,346
Jesus must have had
just from starting conversations.

00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,415
Of course, the one
we’re most familiar with is in John chapter 4

00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,517
—the Samaritan woman at the well.

00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:54,787
Not only was that a great witness

00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:59,792
but just think about all of those
who became believers afterward.

00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:04,797
And all of that started simply
from Jesus starting a conversation

00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:06,933
—asking for water.

00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:11,638
We may not always have
as many opportunities at Bethel

00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,107
to engage in the house-to-house work
as we would like,

00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:17,410
but certainly as we travel,
as we move about,

00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:20,480
this can present greater opportunities

00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,782
to start conversations.

00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:26,185
In last month’s meeting workbook,
there was an article

00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,522
“Starting Conversations
That Can Lead to a Witness,”

00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:34,260
and that article just provided
many excellent, practical suggestions

00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:36,262
that we can implement.

00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:38,698
So if we follow these suggestions,

00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,703
well, this is a nice way that we can show
and demonstrate our gratitude.

00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:47,640
We’re making the best use
of our time to start a witness.

00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:48,641
So, as we mentioned,

00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:50,643
there are many ways
that we can show our gratitude.

00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,445
But certainly these two:

00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:56,749
Our study of God’s Word and applying
the suggestions to improve our ministry

00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,852
are two ways that we can certainly implement.

00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:04,157
So in imitation of Jesus, Jeremiah,

00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:06,526
many other faithful Witnesses of Jehovah,

00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:10,630
may we do what we can
to show that we are invested,

00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:14,367
that we show our love for God
and our love for people

00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:19,372
as we appreciatively carry out
our commission to preach the good news.

00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:23,209
“Love Never Fails”!

00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,179
was the theme of last year’s conventions.

00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:31,184
Twenty-four international conventions
were held in different parts of the earth.

00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:34,053
As we’ll see in the following report,

00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,055
our international conventions

00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:40,059
showcased the love and unity
of Jehovah’s people,

00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,563
and they provided a tremendous witness.

00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,403
Jesus said that the identifying mark

00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,405
of true Christians would be

00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,407
their love for one another.

00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:56,309
This was especially evident

00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,480
at our 2019 “Love Never Fails”!
International Conventions.

00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:12,558
I never expected
the welcome that we received.

00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,429
There were over 200 brothers in the airport.

00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:22,034
For me, it’s like I’m in Paradise already
because of the love I feel here.

00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:25,505
Wherever I turn, there’s love.

00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:28,040
As I walked around the corner,

00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:31,677
the reception of the friends,
the way they embraced me,

00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:33,646
was something
that I could not have expected.

00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,748
No one could’ve even described it to me.

00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:49,729
Mexico has a lot of different cultures.

00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,731
But here in this stadium,

00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:54,100
we are one people united by love,

00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:56,102
serving Jehovah.

00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:58,871
That’s unique, it’s wonderful,

00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:00,907
and it’s all thanks to love.

00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:05,878
It doesn’t matter where we come from
or what language we speak.

00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:07,980
The language here is love.

00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:17,557
Our love of neighbor motivated us
to share in a global preaching campaign.

00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,827
Foreign delegates
worked shoulder to shoulder

00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:22,829
with hosts from the local city

00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,799
to invite millions of people
from around the world

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,571
to one of the 24 international conventions.

00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:35,608
This gave our brothers and sisters
from different parts of the globe

00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:38,478
an opportunity to get to know each other,

00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:43,483
united by the common goal of spreading
the good news to everyone they met.

00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:46,652
I worked in field service with a sister

00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:49,689
who used to study the Bible
with a Brazilian woman.

00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,260
The sister had prayed to send
a Brazilian sister to accompany her.

00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:56,762
When we visited the woman together,

00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:59,499
she could see the love we have between us

00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,134
and the efforts we made to come so far

00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:04,770
to attend the convention here in Denmark.

00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,573
Over a million people attended

00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,909
the international conventions
in many different languages.

00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:15,715
Both foreign and local delegates
as well as newly interested ones

00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:20,720
were able to learn firsthand
how love never fails.

00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:24,123
“Clothe yourselves with love,

00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:27,527
for it is a perfect bond of union.”

00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:30,730
First, love identifies us.

00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,269
Humility
—that’s love in action.

00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,938
Loyal love is a beautiful aspect

00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,274
of Jehovah’s personality.

00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,410
Well, Jesus made it simple, didn’t he?

00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:47,980
He said: ‘Look for the love.

00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,984
Look for the love,
and you’ll find the right religion.’

00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:55,321
Christian love has power.

00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:57,924
It can reach hearts in ways

00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:00,927
that the spoken word cannot.

00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:04,931
But, really,
what other group of persons on earth

00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:09,335
are interested in discussing
love that doesn’t fail?

00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:11,337
When someone sees us,

00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:13,839
they should see a loving individual.

00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,909
When they see any one of us

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,946
who are servants of Jehovah,

00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:23,950
then they should see love.

00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,523
In addition to spending time in the ministry,
activities were planned

00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:32,925
so that delegates could get to know

00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:36,362
their brothers better.

00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,036
This gave delegates the opportunity
to learn about the culture

00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:49,041
and our spiritual heritage
in the host country.

00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:54,280
In some cities,
they visited exhibits and locations

00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:57,917
where previously our faith
and love had been tested.

00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:02,788
For example, delegates in Berlin
had the opportunity to visit

00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:04,991
Sachsenhausen concentration camp

00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:07,526
where many of our brothers were imprisoned

00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,562
during World War II.

00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:12,164
I thought it was especially amazing,

00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:15,635
despite the circumstances
those brothers and sisters faced,

00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:17,670
that even their persecutors

00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:20,773
had to recognize
the true identifying mark of Christianity

00:49:20,774 --> 00:49:22,775
—of love.

00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:27,880
This visit showed the faithful endurance
our brothers and sisters

00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,850
demonstrated under vicious persecution

00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:33,819
and the love they had for Jehovah

00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,890
–a fitting example of love that never fails.

00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:43,529
Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate
Jehovah’s Witnesses;

00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,165
he called them a brood.

00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:50,469
But instead,
Jehovah’s Witnesses are still here,

00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,040
proving that Christian love never fails.

00:49:57,878 --> 00:50:02,348
Another example of faith and endurance
was seen in Seoul, Korea.

00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:10,222
Since 1953,
young Korean brothers had been imprisoned

00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:12,358
for refusing military service.

00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:15,528
Altogether,

00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:20,066
over 19,000 brothers
who refused to compromise their faith

00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:24,704
spent nearly 37,000 years in prison.

00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:29,408
Delegates were able to visit
a neutrality exhibition to learn more

00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:32,011
about the strong faith and unwavering courage

00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:35,214
these young brothers displayed.

00:50:35,215 --> 00:50:38,317
On February 28, 2019,

00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:42,354
the last of our imprisoned brothers
was released.

00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:49,528
Because I received
a not-guilty verdict just two weeks ago,

00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:52,698
I was able to attend
this international convention.

00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,401
I am so grateful to Jehovah.

00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:01,240
My son receiving this acquittal
enabled him to attend this convention.

00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,843
We never imagined this would be possible.

00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,613
What a joy it was
for these brothers to attend

00:51:07,614 --> 00:51:12,017
this historic international convention
alongside their families

00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:15,054
and thousands of foreign delegates!

00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:18,691
Just being able to sit
next to my son for the convention

00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:20,826
completely fills my heart.

00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:34,974
Despite an ongoing economic crisis,

00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:37,209
many delegates from Venezuela

00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,979
were able to attend
the international convention

00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,214
in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,284
Coming from Venezuela,

00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:48,487
it’s difficult to earn
a living or save money.

00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:52,992
We had to sell our electronic devices
and work long hours to be here.

00:51:52,993 --> 00:51:54,994
But these sacrifices 

00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:56,996
will always be worth it.

00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:04,503
The love we show to our brothers is possible

00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:07,973
because of the love Jehovah shows us.

00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:12,845
An expression of his love to us
comes in the form of his Word, the Bible.

00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:15,614
In Copenhagen, Denmark,

00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:19,919
delegates from Iceland
were delighted to receive a special gift.

00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:23,756
We are happy to announce the release

00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:28,394
of the Icelandic New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:39,738
Additionally,
at several 2019 international conventions,

00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:44,076
our brothers received
the revised New World Translation 

00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,846
in the language of their heart.

00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,481
I can really feel the love from Jehovah.

00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:24,817
He’s given us this wonderful gift

00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:28,120
because he wants us to know
that the words in this book

00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,155
are from him.

00:53:31,258 --> 00:53:34,326
The conventions also gave
thousands the opportunity

00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,395
to express their love for Jehovah

00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:39,331
by symbolizing their dedication to him

00:53:39,332 --> 00:53:41,800
through baptism.

00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:49,608
The love among our brothers
was evident to onlookers as well.

00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:51,610
The police directing traffic

00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:54,847
had less work than they normally do.

00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:58,784
The atmosphere was so contagious
that they started greeting

00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:00,886
foreign and local delegates.

00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:03,022
They were so happy.

00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:07,092
They said:
“This country does not need more police.

00:54:07,093 --> 00:54:09,962
What it needs is more Jehovah’s Witnesses!”

00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:16,168
Our 2019 international conventions
have given us

00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:19,171
an opportunity to demonstrate
how Jehovah’s love

00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,141
motivates us to love.

00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:26,712
Well, as we approach
the end of this system of things,

00:54:26,713 --> 00:54:30,683
we’re going to need love
more than ever before.

00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,985
Of course,
we need loyalty;

00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:35,154
of course,
we need endurance;

00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:39,291
and, of course,
we’re going to sing that song of courage.

00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:41,493
But remember what else we want

00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:44,630
—Jehovah’s loyal love!

00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:49,568
May we be determined
to imitate Him in letting

00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:54,573
our love never ever fail,

00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:58,777
all to Jehovah’s glory.

00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:07,386
Our program has focused

00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,556
on meeting the challenge
of bearing thorough witness.

00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,893
Before we close,
here’s the video postcard

00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:18,230
of our Aymara-speaking brothers
and sisters in Bolivia.

00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:23,602
This South American country
is home to about 28,500 publishers

00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:27,406
and nearly 7,000 pioneers.

00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:31,276
Bolivia officially recognizes Spanish

00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:35,381
and 36 indigenous languages,
including Aymara.

00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:37,950
Of the country’s 11 million people,

00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:41,620
about 1.6 million speak Aymara.

00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:46,525
This is the remote translation office
in the city of El Alto.

00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,594
Twenty translators are helping

00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:53,198
to provide Bible-based literature
in the Aymara language.

00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:55,200
In 2017,

00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:58,437
the New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures 

00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,773
was released in Aymara.

00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,475
Most of the Aymara-speaking territory

00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:06,078
surrounds beautiful Lake Titicaca

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,214
and includes parts of Bolivia and Peru.

00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,484
Reaching those in isolated villages involves

00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:15,354
hours of traveling and walking.

00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:17,356
The response is encouraging.

00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,293
The Aymara people respect God’s Word

00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,963
and highly appreciate spiritual discussions.

00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,367
Today, there are 31 Aymara congregations

00:56:28,368 --> 00:56:31,870
and 14 Aymara-language groups in Bolivia.

00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:36,642
The Copacabana Aymara Congregation is located

00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,145
at an altitude of 3,800 meters,

00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,849
or nearly 12,500 feet.

00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,318
The congregation includes this isolated group

00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,223
located about an hour and a half
from Copacabana.

00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:54,626
Copacabana is a very popular tourist spot.

00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,997
People come from around the world
to see Andean culture

00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,999
and beautiful Lake Titicaca.

00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,968
The congregation engages

00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:05,537
in many forms of public witnessing.

00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,175
Their territory even includes
an island in the middle of the lake.

00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,412
Our brothers and sisters

00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:16,281
of the Copacabana Aymara Congregation

00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:19,985
send you
their warm Christian love and greetings.

00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:24,289
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:27,292
this is JW Broadcasting.
