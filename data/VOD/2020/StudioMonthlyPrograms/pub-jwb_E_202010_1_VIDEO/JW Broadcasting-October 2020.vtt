Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights
from this month’s program.

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll discuss the many ways

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prayer can help us resist temptations.

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:17.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we’ll see how prayer
helped Narciso leave behind

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
practices that conflicted
with Bible principles.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last year, millions were delighted to receive

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revised <i>New World Translation</i> in Spanish.

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll go behind the scenes

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what it took to produce
this translation of God’s Word.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among Jehovah’s most endearing qualities

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is his willingness to forgive.

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new music video
reminds us that with Jehovah’s help,

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:47.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too can forgive others.

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:49.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting®.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month, we’re going to discuss the theme

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:13.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Pray Continually,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.926 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So That You May Not Enter Into Temptation.”

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Those words of Jesus

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are recorded at Matthew 26:41.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this discussion,
we’ll answer three important questions:

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Why did Jesus pray?

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) What temptations did he face?

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:40.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) What lessons can we learn
from Jesus’ example?

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by reading that verse together.

00:01:43.953 --> 00:01:48.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Matthew 26:41:

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch and pray continually,

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The spirit, of course,
is eager [or, “willing,” ftn.],

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the flesh is weak.”

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus pray?

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus uttered these words

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:09.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the final night before his execution.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt this was the most difficult evening

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus had ever faced.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The surrounding verses tell us

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:21.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he began to feel grieved
and to be greatly troubled.”

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard for us to comprehend fully

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stress and pressure
Jesus was facing on that night.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that Satan was about to throw
everything he could at him.

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:37.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also knew that he’d soon die

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an agonizing death.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else
was even harder for him to handle.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized
that he was about to be falsely charged

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:52.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and convicted of the despicable crime

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:56.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of blasphemy against Jehovah’s holy name.

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:02.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note on Matthew 26:39 says:

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus no doubt felt great concern

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over the reproach that his death

00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as one charged with blasphemy and sedition

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“could bring on God,

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:16.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“moving him to pray

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this ‘cup’ pass away from him.”

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:22.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the face of all that pressure,

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:26.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would Jesus remain faithful until death?

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lives of countless people
hung in the balance.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more important,

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:36.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Father’s reputation was involved.

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:40.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under all that intense emotional stress,

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:42.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did Jesus do?

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prayed, not just once,

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but three times!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Luke describes what happened,

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:55.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Luke 22:44:

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he was in such agony

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he kept praying more earnestly;

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his sweat became as drops of blood

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
falling to the ground.”

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about it.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew Satan well.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had observed from heaven

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the temptations that Satan uses

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his efforts to ensnare God’s servants.

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:25.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jesus did not feel
that he could easily handle

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:29.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever “the Tempter”
might place before him.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:31.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a clear lesson for us:

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the perfect Son of God

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:37.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt the need to pray
for divine help and strength,

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:40.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much more so should we.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How appropriate then is the admonition:

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray continually,

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not enter into temptation.”

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean
to “enter into temptation”?

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:58.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  back in 1951 explained:

00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:03.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We ourselves under Satan’s influence

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“create the temptation
by thinking how nice it would be

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to do or to have something
contrary to God’s will,

00:05:11.127 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then not dismissing
the desire created by this improper thinking,

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but considering it more and more.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In this way we are drawn out

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:25.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and led to ignore God’s counsel and warning.

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enter into temptation.”

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer helps us when we face temptation.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us to focus
on what Jehovah wants us to do

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:42.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to ask him for the strength
not to enter into temptation.

00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:43.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second question:

00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What temptations did Jesus face

00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while here on earth?

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We probably immediately think
of the occasion shortly after Jesus’ baptism

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:57.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was tempted three times by the Devil.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s quickly summarize
those three temptations.

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jesus was asked
to turn stones into bread

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when he was extremely hungry.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, Satan appealed
to Jesus’ desire for food.

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jesus immediately rejected
the temptation

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to satisfy that desire
in an inappropriate way.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Satan challenged Jesus

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to throw himself off the temple battlement.

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:32.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus rejected this temptation as well.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he knew
that such a spectacular display

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:42.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would amount
to a prideful testing of Jehovah.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally,

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan offered Jesus

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:49.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the kingdoms of the world
and their glory.”

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at what price?

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan demanded that Jesus offer him in return

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an act of worship.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jesus’ answer?

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:04.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He flatly refused, saying: “Go away, Satan!”

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:08.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you had to face similar temptations?

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:10.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might quickly answer:

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No one has asked me
to turn stones into bread

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or to jump off a tall building.

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:17.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And certainly no one has offered me

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rulership
of all the governments in the world!’

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice, please, we said “similar,”
not “the same.”

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So have you faced similar temptations?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you have.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us have faced temptations

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:34.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involving fleshly desires.

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may have been temptations
to commit immorality

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or temptations that appealed to greed

00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an unbalanced concern
about material things.

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other temptations may have appealed
to our pride or tested our humility

00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:53.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our desire to impress others.

00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who of us hasn’t been tempted
by opportunities

00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:00.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered to us by Satan’s world

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for wealth, power, or position?

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what temptation
comes our way, though,

00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember Jesus’ words:
“Pray continually,

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:14.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not enter into temptation.”

00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But were those the only temptations
that Jesus faced?

00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:21.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:08:21.517 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:24.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice Luke’s words

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:29.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Luke 4:13:

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:34.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the Devil,
having finished all the temptation,

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
departed from him
until another convenient time.”

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:43.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Satan ever come back again
to tempt Jesus?

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:46.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have because of what we’re told

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 4:15.

00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that:

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we do not have a high priest

00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:59.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we have one who has been tested

00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:05.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in all respects as we have,

00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but without sin.”

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:11.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever wondered
what other “convenient time”

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan selected to test Jesus?

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider some possibilities.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example occurred in 32 C.E.,

00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about two and a half years
after the initial temptations.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to John 6:15:

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus, knowing
that they were about to come

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and seize him to make him king,

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
withdrew again to the mountain all alone.”

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:43.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This seems like a similar temptation

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what Jesus had already faced.

00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time, the setting was different.

00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:52.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan didn’t directly offer
the kingship to Jesus.

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:56.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no demand
for Jesus to worship the Devil.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, those following Jesus
wanted to make him their king.

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:06.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This temptation was going to be
by popular demand.

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jesus react?

00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even before they could make their move,

00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:15.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus withdrew from them to a mountain,
just by himself.

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he do on the mountain?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answer in a detail

00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
added in the parallel account
recorded by Matthew.

00:10:26.776 --> 00:10:28.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together.

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Matthew 14:23:

00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:35.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After sending the crowds away,

00:10:35.918 --> 00:10:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he went up on the mountain
by himself to pray.”

00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:45.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jesus went there
not just to avoid the crowds

00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to pray.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third question:

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:52.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jesus’ example?

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we may have passed a test,

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or avoided entering into temptation,
in the past,

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we shouldn’t be surprised

00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if a similar temptation may arise again

00:11:05.214 --> 00:11:08.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in a different form or situation

00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:10.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at a convenient time.

00:11:10.986 --> 00:11:12.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For whom?

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:15.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Satan, not us.

00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:19.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another occasion occurred
when Jesus and his apostles

00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:21.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were in the vicinity of Mount Hermon,

00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
near Caesarea Philippi.

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ apostles had just acknowledged him

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus took the opportunity
to expand their thinking further.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what’s recorded

00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 16:21:

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From that time forward,

00:11:43.552 --> 00:11:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus began explaining to his disciples

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he must go to Jerusalem

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and suffer many things

00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:55.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the elders and chief priests
and scribes and be killed,

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:59.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the third day be raised up.”

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:03.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the reaction of his apostles
to this information?

00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read on in verse 22:

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:09.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Peter took him aside

00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:12.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and began to rebuke him, saying:

00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:14.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be kind to yourself, Lord;

00:12:14.383 --> 00:12:17.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not have this happen
to you at all.’”

00:12:17.753 --> 00:12:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although these words were uttered
by a close friend,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus immediately recognized

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:27.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they reflected Satan’s wishes,
not Jehovah’s.

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:29.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he firmly responded:

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Get behind me, Satan!

00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are a stumbling block to me,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you think, not God’s thoughts,

00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:40.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those of men.”

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although this account
doesn’t specifically refer

00:12:43.412 --> 00:12:45.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jesus praying at that time,

00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:49.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that Jesus was a man of prayer.

00:12:49.552 --> 00:12:53.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul tells us at Hebrews 5:7:

00:12:53.088 --> 00:12:55.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During his life on earth,

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:59.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ offered up
supplications and also petitions,

00:12:59.662 --> 00:13:02.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with strong outcries and tears.”

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no doubt those prayers helped Jesus

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:09.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on the reason why he came to earth.

00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That clear focus helped him to see

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Peter’s misguided counsel

00:13:14.977 --> 00:13:19.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would only help to further
the Tempter’s cause.

00:13:19.114 --> 00:13:21.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this teach us?

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This shows us that temptations
don’t always come

00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:28.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who are Jehovah’s enemies.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who are close to us

00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may even serve Satan’s ends unintentionally,

00:13:34.163 --> 00:13:36.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as was the case with Peter.

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be an employer,
a workmate, a schoolmate,

00:13:40.603 --> 00:13:43.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friend, a relative, a parent,

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother, or a marriage mate.

00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine another example
of how Satan returned to Jesus.

00:13:52.448 --> 00:13:56.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, it was
by means of the religious leaders.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They attacked Jesus verbally,

00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:03.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misquoting Scripture
and hurling senseless accusations at him.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus understood what they were up to
and frankly told them:

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:12.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are from your father the Devil.”

00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We shouldn’t be surprised
if apostates and other opposers

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use similar tactics today.

00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:22.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jesus was accused of blasphemy

00:14:22.177 --> 00:14:24.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and political sedition,

00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:28.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so too God’s people
have been labeled as “extremists”

00:14:28.717 --> 00:14:33.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have been the victims
of all sorts of false accusations.

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:35.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, we remember

00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:39.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really is behind all these attacks

00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:42.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan, the great Tempter!

00:14:42.398 --> 00:14:45.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help us to avoid the temptation

00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:48.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving up because of discouragement?

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we successfully handle

00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:53.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these types of attacks?

00:14:53.776 --> 00:14:56.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul tells us what to do.

00:14:57.846 --> 00:15:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Ephesians 6:11:

00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God

00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be able to stand firm

00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:11.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After speaking about the importance
of putting on the spiritual suit of armor,

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul goes on to say in verse 18

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this should be done together
“with every form of prayer

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:26.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplication

00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[as we] carry on prayer
on every occasion in spirit.”

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:35.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned from our discussion?

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that Satan didn’t try again
to tempt Jesus directly,

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:42.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was persistent.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:45.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept coming back in different guises.

00:15:45.594 --> 00:15:48.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used others to give Jesus wrong advice,

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose and ridicule him,

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:54.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as to try to make him a king.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:59.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we’ve rejected
some serious temptations in the past,

00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:02.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but remember, Satan doesn’t give up on us

00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:05.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because he failed in the past.

00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:08.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a time convenient to him,

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:13.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he may come back to tempt us
with something completely different

00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:15.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the same temptation

00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:18.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dressed up in a different form.

00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the key
to not entering into temptation?

00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to remember and apply
Jesus’ admonition:

00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:30.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray continually,

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:34.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not enter into temptation.”

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:39.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far, we’ve discussed
how we could “enter into temptation”

00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do something wrong.

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:44.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we may also be tempted

00:16:44.787 --> 00:16:47.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to do something right.

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:52.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although we know
that we should forgive another person

00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:55.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for something they have done against us,

00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:58.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps we may enter into the temptation

00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:01.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of avoiding that person
and not forgiving them,

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though
there may be a basis for doing so.

00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:09.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us in such a situation?

00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the answer is:
Pray for Jehovah’s help.

00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:18.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the theme
of our music video for this month.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involves a very painful situation

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:24.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between a mother and a daughter.

00:17:24.093 --> 00:17:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see the role of prayer

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in starting to resolve

00:17:28.497 --> 00:17:32.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what might seem to be an impossible problem.

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got this grudge.
I’m holding it in.

00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s so heavy;
it pulls me down.

00:17:45.347 --> 00:17:51.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I could
turn this around.

00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:58.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand
the need to forgive,

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:04.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not easy
if it’s not my fault.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:11.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These thoughts
bring forgiveness to a halt.

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s right about now
that I have to pray.

00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:21.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw what happened;
he knows my pain.

00:18:21.383 --> 00:18:26.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all
he gives me

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:31.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strength to let it go.

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:36.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I can’t do this
on my own.

00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:46.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:55.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help me to reflect
The way he forgives, the way he forgets.

00:18:55.751 --> 00:19:05.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive freely.

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:20.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trying my best
to let it all go,

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:26.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times,
it comes back to mind.

00:19:26.014 --> 00:19:32.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I could put
all this behind.

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:39.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realize
that I can’t hold on.

00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgiveness means
you don’t bring it back up.

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:52.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This only gets me
in a rut.

00:19:52.007 --> 00:19:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s right about now
that I have to pray.

00:19:57.179 --> 00:20:02.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw what happened;
he knows my pain.

00:20:02.317 --> 00:20:07.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all
he gives me

00:20:07.489 --> 00:20:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strength to let it go.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:17.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I can’t do this
on my own.

00:20:17.699 --> 00:20:27.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:20:27.576 --> 00:20:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help me to reflect
The way he forgives, the way he forgets.

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:20:48.363 --> 00:20:55.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive freely.
Forgive freely.

00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:05.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive freely.
Forgive freely.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure this video touched our hearts.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a difficult situation!

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
such situations are not resolved overnight.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some wounds take a long time to heal,

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:31.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s possible
to start the process of healing

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by trying to forgive.

00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can’t do it alone.

00:21:36.278 --> 00:21:39.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what our song
beautifully emphasized.

00:21:39.514 --> 00:21:44.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep praying, “Jehovah, please help me;

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:46.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help me forgive freely.”

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:49.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next video,

00:21:49.658 --> 00:21:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see another example
of how prayer helps us today.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Narciso Garcia worked hard to bring his life

00:21:57.132 --> 00:22:00.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in harmony with Bible principles.

00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:02.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t easy.

00:22:02.137 --> 00:22:06.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how he dealt with temptations
similar to those Jesus faced.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sweated blood
to train myself in martial arts.

00:22:32.034 --> 00:22:36.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I joined a big competition,
I won the fight.

00:22:36.738 --> 00:22:38.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life changed.

00:22:39.841 --> 00:22:43.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became the bodyguard
of a well-known politician

00:22:43.512 --> 00:22:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taught martial arts
to some popular celebrities.

00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:52.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My students and my boss

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his family
—they all became part of my life.

00:23:00.228 --> 00:23:04.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was still looking for something.

00:23:12.741 --> 00:23:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, some Jehovah’s Witnesses
came by and gave me a tract.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was surprised

00:23:21.516 --> 00:23:24.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really happy to learn God’s name.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘This could be
what I’ve been looking for.’

00:23:31.426 --> 00:23:33.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I accepted a Bible study,

00:23:33.995 --> 00:23:38.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I realized that I owed everything to God.

00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:52.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I attended my first meeting,

00:23:52.147 --> 00:23:56.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw how humble and caring
the Witnesses were.

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:06.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my neighbors made fun of me.

00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:11.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to beat them because I knew I could.

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:20.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was ashamed that I couldn’t do anything

00:24:20.275 --> 00:24:22.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend Jehovah’s name.

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:27.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one morning before going to the meeting,

00:24:27.415 --> 00:24:30.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first time,

00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:34.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I approached Jehovah in prayer,
asking him to give me courage.

00:24:34.856 --> 00:24:37.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t do it alone.

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:45.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that prayer,
I felt that Jehovah really strengthened me,

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:48.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I humbly told the neighbors

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was going to the Kingdom Hall.

00:24:54.176 --> 00:24:56.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then,

00:24:56.211 --> 00:25:00.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always prayed to Jehovah
when making decisions.

00:25:01.383 --> 00:25:04.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to leave martial arts.

00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:09.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to quit my job as a bodyguard
and stop carrying guns.

00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:23.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing his will wasn’t always easy,

00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:27.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah gave me the courage to do so.

00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:36.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My boss asked me to visit him.

00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:39.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He offered me a new car

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and double my salary.

00:25:43.692 --> 00:25:47.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His offer was very tempting.

00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:50.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went to the washroom and intensely

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:53.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayed again to Jehovah for courage.

00:25:56.771 --> 00:26:01.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, help me, please,” I said.

00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:04.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can’t do this on my own.”

00:26:10.151 --> 00:26:13.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I chose Jehovah.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:18.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is more precious to me
than anything this world could offer.

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:21.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him,

00:26:23.231 --> 00:26:27.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sorry, but I am not accepting your offer.”

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like losing a family in death.

00:26:34.242 --> 00:26:36.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I got baptized.

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:43.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that it didn’t matter
what people thought about me.

00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:47.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how Jehovah sees me that matters.

00:26:47.422 --> 00:26:49.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am very grateful

00:26:49.924 --> 00:26:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be with the brothers in serving Jehovah.

00:26:54.562 --> 00:26:58.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am now serving as a regular pioneer.

00:27:01.169 --> 00:27:03.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the life

00:27:03.204 --> 00:27:04.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had been looking for.

00:27:11.346 --> 00:27:14.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was Narciso tempted?

00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:18.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When his neighbors made fun of him
for going to the Kingdom Hall,

00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:21.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he thought about using these

00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:24.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and going back to using martial arts.

00:27:24.326 --> 00:27:28.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, ridicule tested Narciso’s humility.

00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:30.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through prayer,

00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:35.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was able to speak calmly
and confidently with his neighbors.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:40.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Narciso’s boss tempted him
with a new car and a raise.

00:27:40.508 --> 00:27:42.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Narciso do?

00:27:42.977 --> 00:27:46.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He immediately went to a quiet place

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:49.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed intensely.

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:53.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave him the courage
to make the right decision.

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:57.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we face similar temptations,

00:27:57.959 --> 00:28:00.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be confident that through prayer,

00:28:00.962 --> 00:28:03.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will help us to do the right thing.

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:07.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way Jehovah responds to prayer

00:28:07.902 --> 00:28:11.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by directing us to the Scriptures.

00:28:11.673 --> 00:28:15.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we find
wonderful examples of faithful servants

00:28:15.643 --> 00:28:19.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who overcame all sorts of challenges.

00:28:19.647 --> 00:28:22.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see what we can learn
from the apostle Peter.

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:34.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After working unassigned territory,

00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:38.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made up my mind to put in my application
for regular pioneering.

00:28:50.612 --> 00:28:54.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, things were going
really well at work.

00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:03.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this the right time
to make a drastic change?

00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:13.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new foreign-language group
is being formed in our congregation.

00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:23.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no way I’m joining.

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how difficult it is?

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:29.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe this isn’t right for me.

00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:32.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The culture and language are so different.

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:40.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our youngest now

00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:57.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his own assignment,

00:29:57.178 --> 00:29:59.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe we could serve
where the need is greater,

00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:01.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like we did before the kids.

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:21.102 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But we’re not that energetic couple anymore.

00:30:33.348 --> 00:30:35.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s too much.

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:43.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shared my concerns about pioneering

00:30:43.558 --> 00:30:46.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone who’s been doing it
for a long time.

00:30:49.731 --> 00:30:51.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminded me
of the apostle Peter’s example.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a fisherman by trade,

00:31:04.913 --> 00:31:07.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jesus knew

00:31:07.415 --> 00:31:09.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be so much more.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter hadn’t caught anything all night,

00:31:16.758 --> 00:31:21.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with Jesus next to him,
things would be different.

00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:34.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter felt overwhelmed.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simon,

00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:50.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stop being afraid.

00:31:50.124 --> 00:31:53.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From now on you will be catching men alive.

00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:06.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ministry would be his life’s work.

00:32:13.247 --> 00:32:15.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter faced a situation

00:32:15.249 --> 00:32:18.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar to mine in Syrian Antioch.

00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:21.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, he associated freely

00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:23.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Gentile Christians.

00:32:25.627 --> 00:32:29.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then some from the congregation
in Jerusalem visited,

00:32:35.803 --> 00:32:39.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his fear of their opinion
closed his heart.

00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:46.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used

00:32:46.648 --> 00:32:49.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul to help Peter put aside

00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:51.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his fear of man.

00:33:10.438 --> 00:33:14.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I prayed to Jehovah
to help me open my heart wide.

00:33:19.847 --> 00:33:21.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We turned to the wisdom

00:33:21.849 --> 00:33:24.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of older ones,

00:33:24.552 --> 00:33:27.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they reminded us of Peter’s ministry.

00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:33.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may have been our age when he moved

00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:35.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the need was greater in Babylon.

00:33:35.963 --> 00:33:38.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have had concerns like ours.

00:33:38.499 --> 00:33:40.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could they make the trip?

00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adapt to a different place?

00:33:45.473 --> 00:33:48.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they trusted in Jehovah
to help them succeed.

00:34:07.095 --> 00:34:09.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do the same.

00:34:19.407 --> 00:34:21.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we overcome our doubts

00:34:31.185 --> 00:34:33.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and open our hearts wide, 

00:34:38.292 --> 00:34:41.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can conquer fear

00:34:49.871 --> 00:34:52.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and receive Jehovah’s blessing

00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:57.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the full.

00:35:01.983 --> 00:35:03.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter was like us.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:05.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved Jehovah.

00:35:05.987 --> 00:35:08.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved his brothers.

00:35:08.256 --> 00:35:13.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also had doubts and fears
that sometimes held him back.

00:35:13.261 --> 00:35:17.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter relied on Jehovah to conquer fear.

00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:19.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do the same.

00:35:20.468 --> 00:35:23.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our prayers are not limited to asking Jehovah

00:35:23.504 --> 00:35:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for help with our concerns and our needs.

00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:31.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also ask Jehovah to help others.

00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:34.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in action in our next video.

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:44.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray for my brothers and sisters every day

00:35:44.192 --> 00:35:48.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I know Jehovah
is the Hearer of prayer.

00:35:55.903 --> 00:35:58.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since our baptism,

00:35:58.439 --> 00:36:02.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as a family
were fully engaged in Christian activities.

00:36:07.448 --> 00:36:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a busy yet fulfilling life.

00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:17.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really loved preaching.

00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:20.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed conducting Bible studies

00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:22.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talking to others about the truth.

00:36:24.465 --> 00:36:29.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point,
I was the only elder in the congregation.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:33.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to make
shepherding calls on everyone,

00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I just did not have the time,

00:36:37.144 --> 00:36:39.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I developed the habit

00:36:39.347 --> 00:36:42.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of praying for them
many times during the day.

00:36:44.418 --> 00:36:47.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would mention them individually by name.

00:36:47.822 --> 00:36:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted Jehovah to protect

00:36:51.158 --> 00:36:54.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his precious sheep from Satan’s attacks.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time later,

00:37:01.302 --> 00:37:03.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife fell seriously ill.

00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:08.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being hospitalized for a while,

00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to take care of her at home.

00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:15.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to step down from pioneering.

00:37:16.817 --> 00:37:21.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kuniko served Jehovah faithfully
until her death.

00:37:23.824 --> 00:37:27.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, I became sick as well.

00:37:27.194 --> 00:37:31.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One morning,
I felt especially bad and couldn’t move.

00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:48.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fortunately, I managed to survive somehow,

00:37:48.082 --> 00:37:50.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I’m confined to a wheelchair.

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:55.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can no longer walk
in the ministry as I used to

00:37:55.656 --> 00:37:58.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or handle congregation responsibilities.

00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:05.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help
to change clothes and take a shower.

00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:07.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get really depressed

00:38:07.068 --> 00:38:12.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I think of the times
when I was able to move around freely.

00:38:19.513 --> 00:38:24.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah
never forgets the love we’ve shown.

00:38:24.518 --> 00:38:28.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is pleased to see us doing our very best

00:38:28.689 --> 00:38:31.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whatever circumstances we are in.

00:38:33.294 --> 00:38:38.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am limited in what I can do,
but I can still pray.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my prayers,
I mention

00:38:42.203 --> 00:38:44.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the names of those in my congregation

00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:46.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my personal friends.

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:50.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I make a list of their names
so as not to forget anyone.

00:38:52.213 --> 00:38:54.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through jw.org®,

00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read about the brothers
in Russia being arrested

00:38:57.284 --> 00:39:00.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the situation in Eritrea,

00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:04.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I make sure to include them in my prayers.

00:39:05.826 --> 00:39:09.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body and its helpers
and those in full-time service

00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:12.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also need Jehovah’s support.

00:39:14.735 --> 00:39:18.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is without a doubt
the Hearer of prayer.

00:39:19.974 --> 00:39:22.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was the only elder in the congregation

00:39:23.277 --> 00:39:25.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when my wife was sick in bed,

00:39:26.914 --> 00:39:29.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he listened to my prayers.

00:39:32.253 --> 00:39:35.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I am confident
that the prayers that I offer

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:38.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help my fellow friends.

00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:45.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I do what I can in service,

00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:47.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as witnessing to caregivers.

00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:51.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meet those
whom I have not seen for a long time

00:39:51.138 --> 00:39:54.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell them “I’ve been praying for you,”

00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:57.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they often tell me
how it has really helped them.

00:39:57.778 --> 00:40:00.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even shed tears out of gratitude.

00:40:00.114 --> 00:40:03.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel happy too.

00:40:05.352 --> 00:40:08.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I’m getting
physically weaker every day,

00:40:08.622 --> 00:40:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my prayers are becoming

00:40:10.891 --> 00:40:13.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more and more meaningful.

00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:17.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to cherish
this precious gift of prayer

00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:20.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has given us

00:40:20.034 --> 00:40:23.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as I live.

00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:35.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takeshi could easily
dwell on all the things he can’t do.

00:40:35.483 --> 00:40:39.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he focuses
on his brothers and sisters.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prays for them every day.

00:40:42.723 --> 00:40:45.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’re not generic prayers.

00:40:45.126 --> 00:40:48.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes lists
so that he doesn’t miss anyone,

00:40:48.496 --> 00:40:51.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he goes to jw.org®

00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:54.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn about our brothers in need.

00:40:54.502 --> 00:40:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does he make this effort?

00:40:56.604 --> 00:40:58.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takeshi said,

00:40:58.606 --> 00:41:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know [that] Jehovah
is the Hearer of prayer.”

00:41:04.778 --> 00:41:09.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether we’re dealing
with the effects of old age and illness

00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with persecution and unrest,

00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:16.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we face a common enemy, Satan the Devil.

00:41:16.457 --> 00:41:21.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah
help us win this spiritual warfare?

00:41:21.028 --> 00:41:25.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Harold Corkern
explains how in this Bethel morning worship.

00:41:27.034 --> 00:41:29.036 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our text highlights the fact

00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:32.840 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we are at war with Satan.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.842 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
War is defined

00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:37.077 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as “a state of hostility

00:41:37.077 --> 00:41:39.079 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“accompanied by actions

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:41.315 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“to conquer or to destroy

00:41:41.315 --> 00:41:44.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those viewed as the enemy.”

00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:48.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the context
of our text today at 1 Peter 5:8

00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:51.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talks about the type of enemy we have

00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:56.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“a roaring lion,
seeking to devour someone.”

00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:58.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that expression “roaring” denotes

00:41:58.899 --> 00:42:03.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the howl of a beast in fierce hunger.”

00:42:03.904 --> 00:42:06.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have a real enemy.

00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:08.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why the words of Jesus

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:13.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are so meaningful for us
when he gave the model prayer.

00:42:13.214 --> 00:42:15.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said at Matthew 6:13:

00:42:15.983 --> 00:42:18.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not bring us into temptation,

00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:22.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but deliver
[or, the footnote, “rescue”] us

00:42:22.223 --> 00:42:24.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wicked one.”

00:42:24.525 --> 00:42:26.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, other Bible translations,

00:42:26.527 --> 00:42:30.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the <i>King</i> <i>James Version</i>
or the <i>Revised Standard Version,</i>

00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:35.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use an expression like,
“Deliver us from evil.”

00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or the <i>Contemporary English Version</i> says:

00:42:37.671 --> 00:42:40.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Protect us from evil.”

00:42:40.507 --> 00:42:45.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that doesn’t convey
the real fierceness of a real enemy, does it?

00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:46.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more generic.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jesus knew the Devil was real,

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:53.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is a real enemy.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Devil has no remorse.

00:42:55.723 --> 00:42:58.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s fierce.
He has no pity.

00:42:58.692 --> 00:43:02.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will take a person and,
with his traps and lures,

00:43:02.296 --> 00:43:05.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get him to do something
bad in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:07.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the person is overcome with guilt.

00:43:07.368 --> 00:43:09.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, like a fierce enemy,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Devil comes along and stomps on him

00:43:11.772 --> 00:43:15.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes him feel worse
because he caved in and sinned.

00:43:16.977 --> 00:43:20.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we deal
with such a powerful enemy?

00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:24.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in war, there are soldiers.

00:43:24.618 --> 00:43:27.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s use an expression

00:43:27.087 --> 00:43:30.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul used
to describe our situation.

00:43:30.324 --> 00:43:34.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles, please,
to the book of 2 Timothy.

00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2 Timothy chapter 2,
we’re going to read verses 3 and 4

00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:43.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talk for a few moments
about our being soldiers.

00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:45.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 2:3:

00:43:45.572 --> 00:43:48.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus,

00:43:48.509 --> 00:43:51.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“take your part in suffering adversity.

00:43:51.912 --> 00:43:53.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No man serving as a soldier

00:43:53.914 --> 00:43:56.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“involves himself
in the commercial businesses of life,

00:43:56.917 --> 00:44:01.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to gain the approval
of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.”

00:44:02.623 --> 00:44:05.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We become soldiers of Christ

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we accept Jehovah’s arrangements

00:44:07.828 --> 00:44:09.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for salvation through Christ Jesus

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:14.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we dedicate our lives to him unreservedly

00:44:14.134 --> 00:44:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our entire life.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:20.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We become a soldier and, like a soldier,

00:44:20.107 --> 00:44:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that it’s not going to be easy.

00:44:23.177 --> 00:44:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are going to be hardships and trials.

00:44:26.013 --> 00:44:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, a fine soldier

00:44:28.048 --> 00:44:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his main objective is to stay
loyal to his commanding officers

00:44:31.652 --> 00:44:34.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to those who are giving instructions.

00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:37.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likewise we know
it’s not going to be easy.

00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:41.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy, but we have chosen
to become a soldier of Christ.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a soldier,
like this loyal one being described,

00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:49.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is far different from a mercenary.

00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:53.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mercenary is one
who hires himself out to fight,

00:44:53.474 --> 00:44:56.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he may not have any devotion,
really, to the cause.

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a hired man,
and he’s doing it for the reward only

00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:03.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or for something else that he may gain.

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re not mercenaries.

00:45:05.419 --> 00:45:09.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re those with godly devotion, 
wholly devoted to Jehovah

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:13.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and loyal to Christ
so that we can be fine soldiers,

00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:16.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal and true.

00:45:16.563 --> 00:45:20.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another aspect of soldiers
is that they are identified

00:45:20.901 --> 00:45:23.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their distinctive uniforms

00:45:23.704 --> 00:45:26.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or their particular fighting equipment.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that way, it helps to identify

00:45:28.942 --> 00:45:32.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s the friend and who’s the foe
in the middle of the battle.

00:45:32.413 --> 00:45:36.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their appearance makes that possible.

00:45:36.917 --> 00:45:40.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today,
there is a clear difference, isn’t there,

00:45:40.354 --> 00:45:43.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the soldiers of Satan

00:45:43.424 --> 00:45:46.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the soldiers of Christ?

00:45:46.026 --> 00:45:50.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s great enmity, 
but there’s a sharp contrast

00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:53.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in appearance and attitude and disposition

00:45:53.634 --> 00:45:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivation and conduct.

00:45:57.104 --> 00:45:59.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why when we think about that,

00:45:59.306 --> 00:46:03.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think about the contrast
between “the works of the flesh”

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
described in Galatians chapter 5

00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:08.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those who have
the fruitage of God’s spirit.

00:46:08.649 --> 00:46:11.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is such a strong distinction

00:46:11.285 --> 00:46:15.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between “one serving God
and one not serving him.”

00:46:15.789 --> 00:46:17.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why, too,

00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:21.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think about the type of armor we bear.

00:46:21.862 --> 00:46:24.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians chapter 6 says:

00:46:24.231 --> 00:46:28.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God.”

00:46:28.068 --> 00:46:30.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our very armor is from God.

00:46:30.971 --> 00:46:34.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not use the tactics
and the methods of the Devil,

00:46:34.775 --> 00:46:39.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are clearly identified
as a soldier of Christ.

00:46:39.379 --> 00:46:42.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there can be no gray area here;

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:44.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re either on one side
or the other, correct?

00:46:44.918 --> 00:46:47.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, suppose that you’re a soldier,

00:46:47.855 --> 00:46:51.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re on guard duty, and it’s evening,

00:46:51.024 --> 00:46:54.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see someone approaching,
and you cry out:

00:46:54.328 --> 00:46:56.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Halt! Who goes there?

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friend or foe?”

00:46:58.365 --> 00:47:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you hear back, “I’m both.”

00:47:02.169 --> 00:47:04.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s an enemy.

00:47:05.339 --> 00:47:07.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t be on both sides.

00:47:07.341 --> 00:47:11.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is another aspect
of being a good soldier in this fight?

00:47:11.178 --> 00:47:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles 
to Philippians chapter 1,

00:47:15.215 --> 00:47:20.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians chapter 1,
and we get to the concept of unity

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and working closely together in peace,

00:47:23.023 --> 00:47:27.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because an army needs to be unified.

00:47:27.027 --> 00:47:30.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 1:27 says:

00:47:30.163 --> 00:47:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only behave in a manner
worthy of the good news about the Christ,

00:47:34.234 --> 00:47:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that whether I come
and see you or I am absent,

00:47:38.572 --> 00:47:41.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I may hear about you and learn

00:47:41.174 --> 00:47:44.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you are standing firm in one spirit,

00:47:44.344 --> 00:47:48.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with one soul
[and the footnote, or “with one accord”],

00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:54.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“striving side by side
for the faith of the good news,

00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:58.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and in no way being
frightened by your opponents.

00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This very thing is a proof
of destruction for them,

00:48:01.762 --> 00:48:06.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of salvation for you;
and this is from God.”

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have this matter of unity
—don’t we?—

00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:12.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shoulder to shoulder, side by side.

00:48:12.172 --> 00:48:15.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, one of the tactics of the Devil

00:48:15.909 --> 00:48:20.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to get us divided and disjointed

00:48:20.914 --> 00:48:24.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fighting among ourselves.

00:48:24.051 --> 00:48:28.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To turn the enemy on itself
is a very effective war strategy.

00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:30.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Jehovah used that
—remember?—

00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:31.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against his enemies.

00:48:31.959 --> 00:48:36.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Chronicles 20:20-23,

00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:39.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was the attack
“of Ammon, Moab,

00:48:39.066 --> 00:48:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the mountainous region of Seir”
against Judah.

00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He confused them.

00:48:44.805 --> 00:48:48.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They struck down each other;
they helped destroy one another.

00:48:50.277 --> 00:48:54.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Devil, in a very sinister way,
uses that same approach.

00:48:54.915 --> 00:48:56.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:48:56.249 --> 00:48:59.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if he can get us
to not get along with each other

00:48:59.987 --> 00:49:02.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn on one another,

00:49:02.155 --> 00:49:04.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then that’s a very effective tactic.

00:49:05.826 --> 00:49:08.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we remember the expression

00:49:08.328 --> 00:49:13.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ephesians 4:26, 27 about getting along:

00:49:13.333 --> 00:49:16.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be wrathful, but do not sin;

00:49:16.503 --> 00:49:19.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not let the sun set
while you are still angry;

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not give the Devil an opportunity.”

00:49:22.876 --> 00:49:26.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he sees discord and disunity,

00:49:26.647 --> 00:49:28.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can really amplify that.

00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:32.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to remember
who our real enemies are.

00:49:32.486 --> 00:49:36.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our brothers may disappoint us; 
they may frustrate us;

00:49:36.023 --> 00:49:39.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may hurt us at times
because of imperfections.

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they’re not the enemy.

00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil and his hordes
—they are the enemies.

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:48.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t get to fighting
with the wrong person.

00:49:48.568 --> 00:49:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We keep in mind
that our brothers are with us.

00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:54.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in this connection

00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:56.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we just read it
in that scripture in Philippians),

00:49:56.143 --> 00:49:58.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it talked about not being afraid.

00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:02.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember
something about being afraid

00:50:02.716 --> 00:50:06.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it related
to a soldier in Israel’s army?

00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:09.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 20:8 says:

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:12.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The officers should also ask the people,

00:50:12.125 --> 00:50:14.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Who is fearful and fainthearted?

00:50:14.461 --> 00:50:16.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘He should return to his house,

00:50:16.697 --> 00:50:21.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he may not cause
his brothers to lose heart as he has.’”

00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:24.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we do have an effect on each other.

00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:27.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine being in Joshua’s army,

00:50:27.674 --> 00:50:30.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting ready to battle,
and to your left is a soldier?

00:50:30.911 --> 00:50:32.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you’re about ready
to leave for battle,

00:50:32.946 --> 00:50:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says to you:
“We’re going to die.

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re not going to come back.

00:50:37.284 --> 00:50:39.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say goodbye to your family.
This is it.”

00:50:39.986 --> 00:50:41.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or he may say,

00:50:41.588 --> 00:50:45.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m not sure Joshua
has Jehovah’s backing like Moses did.”

00:50:45.225 --> 00:50:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of that would be terrible.

00:50:47.227 --> 00:50:50.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so anyone
in that category was to go home

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they would have
an effect on others.

00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:56.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful, though, we are
that we have positive, courageous brothers

00:50:56.436 --> 00:50:58.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who trust in Jehovah,

00:50:58.438 --> 00:51:02.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examples in the Bible,
and also modern-day examples,

00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:04.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like our brothers in Russia!

00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:10.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as soldiers in this battle,
we’re ‘not ignorant of Satan’s designs.’

00:51:10.584 --> 00:51:15.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he studies us very carefully,
and he knows our weaknesses.

00:51:15.422 --> 00:51:19.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The September 1, 1988, <i>Watchtower</i>
had an article

00:51:19.593 --> 00:51:23.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stand Firm Against Satan’s Machinations,”

00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:27.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in that, it said the Devil
knows what our weaknesses are.

00:51:27.134 --> 00:51:29.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do we?

00:51:29.136 --> 00:51:32.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t identify them
and then correct them,

00:51:32.539 --> 00:51:34.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be defenseless at times.

00:51:34.908 --> 00:51:37.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it takes honesty and humility

00:51:37.477 --> 00:51:40.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an earnest desire
to address that which is bad.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, we become a victim.

00:51:43.817 --> 00:51:47.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to ask:
‘What are my weaknesses?

00:51:47.154 --> 00:51:50.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I identify them?
Do I work on them?’

00:51:50.257 --> 00:51:54.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, with Jehovah’s help,
we can come off victorious in this battle.

00:51:54.628 --> 00:51:58.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:10 says
that ‘Jehovah will finish our training;

00:51:58.098 --> 00:52:00.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will make us firm;
he will make us strong.’

00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:04.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with Jehovah’s help, we can succeed.

00:52:04.104 --> 00:52:07.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we all continue
as fine soldiers of Christ,

00:52:07.274 --> 00:52:09.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting in Jehovah,

00:52:09.276 --> 00:52:12.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and win the battle
against the enemy—the Devil.

00:52:12.946 --> 00:52:17.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Corkern mentioned,
Satan has no pity.

00:52:17.851 --> 00:52:22.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll try everything
to lure us to sin against Jehovah.

00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last year, the revised <i>New World Translation</i>
in Spanish was released.

00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:34.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was exciting news
for millions of our brothers and sisters.

00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:39.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since Spanish is the most widely spoken
language among Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:42.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this took special effort.

00:52:42.342 --> 00:52:44.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy the following report.

00:52:48.548 --> 00:52:50.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after the Governing Body released

00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:54.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revised English edition
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:57.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they decided to revise the Spanish edition.

00:52:58.658 --> 00:53:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted it to be a modern,
understandable translation

00:53:02.729 --> 00:53:05.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the entire Spanish-speaking world.

00:53:06.533 --> 00:53:11.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spanish is the mother tongue
of around 480 million people.

00:53:11.538 --> 00:53:13.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is also
the most widely spoken language

00:53:13.907 --> 00:53:16.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:20.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This translation project
would be a unique challenge.

00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:23.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It eventually took
four and a half years to complete.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did it take so long?

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:28.955 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Apart from the translation process itself,

00:53:28.955 --> 00:53:31.024 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the work was complicated

00:53:31.024 --> 00:53:33.093 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by the wide geographic range

00:53:33.093 --> 00:53:35.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these Hispanic countries

00:53:35.095 --> 00:53:37.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their different cultures.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This diversity meant
that in different countries

00:53:40.267 --> 00:53:44.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same Spanish word
could mean different things.

00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:48.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other cases,
the word may be unknown

00:53:48.074 --> 00:53:51.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in certain areas
or even sound objectionable to some.

00:53:51.978 --> 00:53:53.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To overcome these difficulties,

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the translators used 100 outside readers

00:53:57.651 --> 00:53:59.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from many different countries

00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to review the translated text progressively.

00:54:03.757 --> 00:54:06.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These readers were of different ages,
cultures, and backgrounds.

00:54:08.128 --> 00:54:11.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These outside readers regularly received
chapters of the Bible electronically,

00:54:11.998 --> 00:54:15.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they introduced
their suggested revisions.

00:54:17.137 --> 00:54:20.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translation teams
took note of all their recommendations,

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in some cases,
they also sent them specific inquiries.

00:54:25.745 --> 00:54:30.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every verse was checked
by 130 different people.

00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:33.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naturally, all of this took time.

00:54:34.587 --> 00:54:38.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work was finished in the spring of 2019.

00:54:38.858 --> 00:54:41.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then another challenge arose.

00:54:41.594 --> 00:54:44.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to print millions of Bibles

00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:47.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to satisfy the demand
of the Spanish-speaking field.

00:54:47.467 --> 00:54:49.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a huge job

00:54:49.669 --> 00:54:52.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our printing presses
in the United States and Japan.

00:54:52.405 --> 00:54:54.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite working night and day,

00:54:54.741 --> 00:54:56.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the task would take a long time.

00:54:56.943 --> 00:55:00.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And naturally, everyone wanted
to have the Bible right away.

00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:04.117 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Right at the Madrid international convention,

00:55:04.117 --> 00:55:06.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body decided to release

00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:08.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible in digital format.

00:55:08.455 --> 00:55:11.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was several months
before all the Bibles could be printed.

00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:14.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The highlight
of the Friday morning convention program

00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:17.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when Brother Lösch
presented the newly revised Bible.

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:19.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was another surprise!

00:55:19.666 --> 00:55:21.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since at the convention

00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:24.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most brothers and sisters
had their phones and tablets with them,

00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:28.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were able to immediately
download the revised Bible.

00:55:28.608 --> 00:55:32.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was that possible?

00:55:32.112 --> 00:55:35.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 500 portable Wi-Fi devices
were distributed

00:55:35.081 --> 00:55:37.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among each of the 11 convention venues

00:55:37.817 --> 00:55:41.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Spain that were
tied in with the Madrid stadium.

00:55:41.454 --> 00:55:44.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the lunch break on Friday,

00:55:44.257 --> 00:55:46.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
practically everyone
in attendance could download

00:55:46.993 --> 00:55:50.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revised Spanish edition
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:53.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 1,200 volunteers were trained

00:55:53.366 --> 00:55:56.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give technical support
to those who needed it.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:00.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, the brothers started
to use the revised translation

00:56:00.573 --> 00:56:03.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right away during the afternoon program.

00:56:06.246 --> 00:56:08.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We laughed and cried with joy.

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:10.617 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We knew it was a gift from Jehovah,

00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:12.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which he was giving us at that moment.

00:56:12.852 --> 00:56:16.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, we felt so happy
because we’d been waiting a long time for it.

00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:19.959 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What I like most about this revision

00:56:19.959 --> 00:56:21.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that it’s very easy to understand.

00:56:21.995 --> 00:56:23.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I think,

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But was this what we had before?’

00:56:25.432 --> 00:56:27.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that it reaches
my heart much quicker.

00:56:28.802 --> 00:56:30.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As you use it,

00:56:30.203 --> 00:56:31.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you realize that many scriptures

00:56:31.704 --> 00:56:35.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been adjusted
and that the faithful slave

00:56:35.375 --> 00:56:38.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has worked very hard
to make it easier to understand.

00:56:40.513 --> 00:56:44.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt, this revised edition
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:49.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a wonderful gift
for all our Spanish-speaking brothers.

00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:51.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Word of God has power,

00:56:51.858 --> 00:56:54.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this will be a powerful tool

00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:58.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help many people get to know Jehovah.

00:57:01.935 --> 00:57:04.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s theme was

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:09.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray Continually,
So That You May Not Enter Into Temptation.”

00:57:09.075 --> 00:57:11.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By trusting in prayer,

00:57:11.377 --> 00:57:13.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Narciso made major changes

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his life and resisted temptations

00:57:16.382 --> 00:57:19.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that tested his humility.

00:57:19.352 --> 00:57:21.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter’s example showed us 

00:57:21.955 --> 00:57:25.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to overcome fear
so that we can show more love 

00:57:25.558 --> 00:57:28.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah and our brothers.

00:57:28.628 --> 00:57:32.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than dwell on his limitations,

00:57:32.098 --> 00:57:34.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takeshi finds joy in praying

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his brothers and sisters every day.

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the song “Forgive Freely”

00:57:40.507 --> 00:57:45.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds us that we can imitate
Jehovah’s quality of forgiveness

00:57:45.178 --> 00:57:47.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to heal the pain of being hurt

00:57:47.647 --> 00:57:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by someone we love.

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:54.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we conclude,
let’s visit our brothers and sisters

00:57:54.654 --> 00:57:59.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Tierra del Fuego
province of Argentina.

00:57:59.192 --> 00:58:01.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tierra del Fuego

00:58:01.194 --> 00:58:04.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a group of islands
off the southernmost tip

00:58:04.297 --> 00:58:07.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the South American mainland.

00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:09.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The main island rises to mountain glaciers

00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:13.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and peaks of nearly 8,000 feet,

00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:15.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 2,400 meters.

00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:20.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here daylight
varies greatly throughout the year

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from about 17 hours during summer

00:58:23.616 --> 00:58:26.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to some 7 hours during winter.

00:58:26.619 --> 00:58:29.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter how much sunlight there is,

00:58:29.222 --> 00:58:31.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there can be wind, ice,

00:58:31.224 --> 00:58:35.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and snow every season of the year.

00:58:35.028 --> 00:58:40.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three congregations are in the city
of Ushuaia on the main island.

00:58:40.033 --> 00:58:42.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To attend assemblies, the brothers

00:58:42.702 --> 00:58:45.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have to cross a mountain range

00:58:45.171 --> 00:58:50.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a trip of about 125 miles,
or 200 kilometers.

00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:55.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes snow and ice
make the roads impassable.

00:58:55.014 --> 00:58:59.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers are out in the ministry
no matter what the weather has in store.

00:58:59.986 --> 00:59:03.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the winter, the sun
doesn’t rise high enough to be seen

00:59:03.856 --> 00:59:07.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
above the mountains in some parts of Ushuaia.

00:59:07.594 --> 00:59:11.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When days are short,
the brothers adapt

00:59:11.231 --> 00:59:15.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and start preaching later
to make the best use of sunlight.

00:59:15.268 --> 00:59:18.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers have organized a campaign

00:59:18.137 --> 00:59:21.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach in rural communities
and on remote islands,

00:59:21.774 --> 00:59:26.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Navarino Island,
across the Beagle Channel.

00:59:26.579 --> 00:59:29.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, some made
a special effort to learn English

00:59:29.849 --> 00:59:32.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that a good witness

00:59:32.085 --> 00:59:34.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be given to the many tourists who visit.

00:59:35.822 --> 00:59:38.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are over 300 publishers

00:59:38.324 --> 00:59:41.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some 47 regular pioneers

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ushuaia’s three congregations.

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re conducting 286 Bible studies.

00:59:47.867 --> 00:59:49.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters

00:59:49.869 --> 00:59:52.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego,

00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:56.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm love and greetings!

00:59:56.342 --> 01:00:00.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
