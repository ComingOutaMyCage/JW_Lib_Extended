Welcome to our program!

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s theme is

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Paying Attention?”

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strained relationships,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illnesses,

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
careers,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entertainment

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we’ll learn how to stay focused on Jehovah

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite these potential distractions.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how our ministry
is more effective

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we focus
on reaching the hearts of people.

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song was written

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for you young adults

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help you keep your eyes

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the prize of life.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting®

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for November 2020.

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you paying attention?

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:13.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve been asked that question

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by your parents, a teacher,

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or someone else in authority.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good question
for each of us to ask ourselves.

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think
of occasions associated with our worship

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that require us to pay special attention?

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when reading the Bible,
attending meetings,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elders when shepherding,

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:43.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you children
when being instructed by your parents.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to pay attention,

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet there are so many distractions

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:50.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—electronic gadgets,

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conversations and activities
of those around us.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, it can be a challenge
to pay attention.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that the phrase “pay attention”

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurs dozens of times
in the <i>New World Translation?</i>

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many of those occurrences,

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:14.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is instructing his people
to pay attention.

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to “pay attention”?

00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:20.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how important is it

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you and I pay attention to Jehovah?

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in 1 Samuel chapter 15

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to answer those questions.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 3, Jehovah instructs King Saul

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strike down the Amalekites

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to devote them
and everything they have to destruction.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, verses 8 and 9 tell us

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Saul did not obey.

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spared the king of Amalek

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the best of the animals.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Saul respond

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Samuel confronted him?

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verses 13-15,

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:10.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Saul tried to justify
his disobedience:

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Samuel finally came to him,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul said to him:

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘May Jehovah bless you.

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:22.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have carried out the word of Jehovah.’

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Samuel said:

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Then what is this sound
of the flock in my ears

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the sound of the cattle that I hear?’

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:33.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this Saul said:

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They were brought from the Amalekites,

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because the people spared
the best of the flock and the herd

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God;

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what was left
we devoted to destruction.’”

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:56.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul attempted to justify his disobedience,

00:03:56.052 --> 00:04:00.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
claiming that the animals
would be sacrificed to Jehovah.

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Jehovah pleased with Saul?

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verse 22,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please note the connection
between paying attention

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and obedience:

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Samuel then said:

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:22.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Does Jehovah take as much pleasure
in burnt offerings and sacrifices

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:28.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:32.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘To obey is better than a sacrifice,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:36.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to pay attention than the fat of rams.’”

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:41.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was one of the causes
of Saul’s disobedience?

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:46.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t pay attention
to Jehovah’s instructions.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His failure to pay attention
resulted in disobedience

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brought Jehovah’s disapproval.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful lesson for us!

00:04:57.347 --> 00:04:59.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As happened with Saul,

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our worship
could become unacceptable to Jehovah

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:05.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we fail to pay attention!

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that we understand
why it is important to pay attention,

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider
three aspects of paying attention

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are discussed in the Bible.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first scripture we’ll consider

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 2 Chronicles 19:6:

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he [Jehoshaphat] said to the judges:

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pay attention to what you are doing,

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:41.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you do not judge for man
but for Jehovah,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is with you when you pass judgment.’”

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This admonition to “pay attention”

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given by King Jehoshaphat

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appointed judges
throughout the land of Judah.

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a sobering reminder!

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those judges had good reason

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to what they were doing.

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were responsible to Jehovah.

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They represented him,

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their decisions
affected the lives of fellow worshippers.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, they needed to be familiar
with Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when handling matters.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an excellent reminder
for those who serve as elders.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good elders are good students of the Bible

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible-based publications.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:41.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their attentiveness to Jehovah

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enables them to pay attention
to what they are doing.

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are going to represent Jehovah

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflect his thinking accurately
as they handle matters

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:55.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether they’re shepherding
the congregation,

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivering a part at a meeting,

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a challenging assignment,

00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or addressing wrongdoing

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they must pay attention
to what they are doing.

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why they must be familiar
with Jehovah’s thinking

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:14.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then take care to follow his direction.

00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:18.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they do, they show
that they are paying attention

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what they are doing.

00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:24.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s interest in assisting the elders

00:07:24.093 --> 00:07:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is demonstrated
in the ongoing education he provides.

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time the circuit overseer
visits the congregation,

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he presents material
prepared especially for the elders.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom Ministry School
and the School for Congregation Elders

00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provide more intensive instruction.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:46.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that elders pay close attention to

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply such instruction!

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their doing so protects,
not just themselves

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also fellow worshippers.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By paying attention, elders will be able

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey direction
to the congregations accurately.

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be especially important
if our worship is banned

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or restricted
in the event of a natural disaster

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:18.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other catastrophic event.

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:21.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us
to the second aspect of paying attention

00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:24.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll consider.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Luke 8:18:

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pay attention to how you listen,

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever has will be given more,

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whoever does not have,

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:45.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even what he imagines he has
will be taken away from him.”

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus mean when he said:

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:54.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay attention to how you listen”?

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those in Jesus’ audience in the first century

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the wonderful privilege
of hearing Jesus’ literal voice

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he instructed them.

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:09.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we can’t hear
the voice of Jesus today,

00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can read his words
and learn of his actions

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as revealed in the Gospel accounts.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we have many opportunities to listen

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah, Jesus,

00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders in our congregation,

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our marriage mate, 

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:32.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our children.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder the Bible writer James stated

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:40.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “everyone must be quick to listen.”

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:42.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:

00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Saul had truly listened receptively

00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:48.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s direction
regarding the Amalekites,

00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would likely have grasped
the importance of the direction he received

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been motivated to obey.

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:59.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, his lack of attentiveness

00:09:59.448 --> 00:10:04.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to disobedience
and Jehovah’s disapproval.

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t pay attention to how we listen,

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could find ourselves becoming critical

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unappreciative

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even disobedient.

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Jehovah instructs and directs us,

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to think
about what we are being told,

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ponder over its meaning,

00:10:26.609 --> 00:10:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mull it over in our mind
and, most important,

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply the instruction in our own lives.

00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:37.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re a young person,

00:10:37.653 --> 00:10:41.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you show that you’re paying attention

00:10:41.023 --> 00:10:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how you listen?

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the admonition
at Ephesians 6:1-3:

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Children, be obedient to your parents

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in union with the Lord,

00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for this is righteous.

00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Honor your father and your mother’

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the first command with a promise:

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That it may go well with you

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you may remain a long time
on the earth.’”

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You children, who do you think
is the source of this direction?

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that these words come from Jehovah.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that the verses state not only

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that children
should “be obedient” to their parents

00:11:28.738 --> 00:11:33.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also that they should
“honor” their parents?

00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you show that you’re paying attention

00:11:37.847 --> 00:11:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how you listen to this direction?

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a boy, I can remember occasions

00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my parents would ask me
to do something,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps to take out the trash.

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would always obey.

00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, I’d make it very clear

00:11:56.599 --> 00:12:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I didn’t really want to do
what was asked.

00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you young ones know what I mean.

00:12:05.107 --> 00:12:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, if we’re truly paying attention

00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:11.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how we listen to Jehovah’s words,

00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be careful to honor our parents,

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is an essential element of obedience.

00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we contribute
to the peace of the family,

00:12:22.892 --> 00:12:27.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we make Jehovah’s heart glad.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,
as the promise in verse 3 indicates,

00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paying attention to how you listen
will protect you

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:39.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute to your success in other ways

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout your adult life.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, all of us should remember

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our everlasting welfare will depend

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our willingness to listen and obey.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important, then, that all of us

00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:59.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay attention to how we listen.

00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:03.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third aspect of paying attention is found

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:08.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:34, 35:

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But pay attention to yourselves

00:13:14.443 --> 00:13:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking

00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:22.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and anxieties of life,

00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suddenly that day
be instantly upon you as a snare.”

00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus admonished his followers

00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to themselves,

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:40.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t have in mind the selfish thinking
that characterized King Saul

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s so common, even encouraged,
in today’s world.

00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:48.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Jesus’ words reveal

00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:51.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the key to paying attention to ourselves

00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is knowing ourselves

00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:58.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—knowing what’s in our figurative heart.

00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a challenge for all of us.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible explains at Jeremiah 17:9:

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:11.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart is more treacherous
than anything else

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:13.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is desperate.

00:14:13.702 --> 00:14:16.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who can know it?”

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 10 answers:

00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:22.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am searching the heart,

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examining the innermost thoughts.”

00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah knows what is in our heart,

00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can help us to know.

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help us to examine
our motives and goals

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to discern why we do certain things.

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:45.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Carefully and honestly looking at ourselves
in the mirror of God’s Word

00:14:45.834 --> 00:14:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can reveal areas in our thinking, words,

00:14:48.938 --> 00:14:50.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actions

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that need attention.

00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:56.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, some of Jehovah’s people

00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:58.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including those of retirement age

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have enjoyed
very comfortable circumstances—

00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have concluded that they needed to make
adjustments in their lifestyle,

00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:08.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simplifying their lives

00:15:08.057 --> 00:15:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who have done so have had the privilege

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of attending
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it meant
stepping out of their comfort zone,

00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps moving to a new congregation,

00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve experienced Jehovah’s blessing
in ways that they couldn’t have anticipated

00:15:31.447 --> 00:15:34.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they share
the benefits of their experience

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theocratic education

00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:38.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their new assignments.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is providing ongoing,
life-saving instruction

00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of his Word and organization.

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May each of us be determined
to “pay attention”

00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what we are doing,

00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how we listen,

00:15:57.573 --> 00:16:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to ourselves.

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing so, we’ll avoid falling
into the trap of disobedience

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as King Saul did.

00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:12.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, as attentive and obedient servants,

00:16:12.287 --> 00:16:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll enjoy Jehovah’s friendship forever.

00:16:17.626 --> 00:16:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders play an important role

00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping us stay focused on Jehovah,

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:26.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly when we’re facing
difficult problems.

00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first video,

00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:33.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how elders provide loving assistance.

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:36.779 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everything was going fine in my marriage

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:38.747 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—or so I thought.

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:42.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My ex-husband was disfellowshipped,

00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:43.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
left home

00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:46.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in less than a month,
we divorced.

00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:53.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after the divorce,
I had to figure out

00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how I would provide for the girls,

00:17:00.502 --> 00:17:04.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I began working as a cleaner.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:08.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to provide for them spiritually.

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:14.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many times,
because of discouragement and tiredness,

00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:18.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t be there for them
as much as they needed me to be.

00:17:20.823 --> 00:17:22.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides all of this,

00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:26.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to deal
with very negative feelings.

00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:29.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very difficult time in my life.

00:17:38.173 --> 00:17:40.309 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had never been so sick.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.544 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t even get up to go to the hospital.

00:17:46.782 --> 00:17:50.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To cope with this problem,
I just kept praying.

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:54.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not able to walk,
and I was not able to get to the meetings.

00:17:57.926 --> 00:18:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders realized
that I was missing from the meetings.

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:09.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders quickly came to my aid.

00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:14.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that one of the things

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touched me the most

00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:19.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when the elders read a scripture.

00:18:20.315 --> 00:18:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 139:3:

00:18:24.219 --> 00:18:28.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You observe me when I travel
and when I lie down;

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:31.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are familiar with all my ways.”

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I am precious to Jehovah.

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if Jehovah was healing me.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now knew that Jehovah
was interested in me

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was looking after me.

00:18:44.072 --> 00:18:46.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was making sure that I knew it.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something else that I remember fondly

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:53.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was after a meeting at the Kingdom Hall.

00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:57.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the elders gave me
some scriptures to read at home

00:18:57.252 --> 00:19:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that if we needed any help,

00:19:00.088 --> 00:19:03.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders were there for us.

00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:08.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two elders lovingly came to see me,

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:10.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I live very far from the Kingdom Hall.

00:19:16.672 --> 00:19:19.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers made the sacrifice
to get public transport,

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get off at the main road,

00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from there they walked 40 minutes

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach my house.

00:19:26.815 --> 00:19:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what I would have done.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the elders arrived,
they listened to me,

00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:37.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they cried with me,
and they read the Bible with me.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves me.

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started to feel better,

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:48.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went back to the group.

00:19:49.204 --> 00:19:52.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really happy
to be back with my brothers.

00:19:57.946 --> 00:20:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after all the help we have received,
we are doing well.

00:20:03.352 --> 00:20:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation is our second home,
and we feel very good there.

00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:13.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I have today,
I owe to the brothers and sisters,

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:16.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the elders.

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:20.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see shepherding calls
as a very evident way

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which Jehovah demonstrates
his full love for us.

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that at times

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:30.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these visits might be
a challenge for the elders,

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:33.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the results are really good.

00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:36.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt,
they can see that all the work

00:20:36.518 --> 00:20:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the effort is worthwhile.

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:42.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will never forget the help
that I received from the elders.

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:47.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This situation taught me that Jehovah
will not let his sheep get lost,

00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:49.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even one.

00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:52.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 23:4 says:

00:20:52.067 --> 00:20:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will raise up over them shepherds

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who will really shepherd them.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They will no longer be afraid or be terrified,

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:02.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and none will be missing,’ declares Jehovah.”

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:08.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the elders help Mariana and Elias?

00:21:08.116 --> 00:21:10.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As good shepherds,

00:21:10.118 --> 00:21:13.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were attentive to Jehovah’s flock,

00:21:13.622 --> 00:21:16.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they were quick to notice
that help was needed.

00:21:16.992 --> 00:21:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They visited Mariana and Elias
in their homes,

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared encouraging scriptures, and listened.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They showed that Jehovah
cares for every one of his sheep.

00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:34.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those brothers,
like the elders in your congregation,

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:38.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paid attention
to the loving training and instruction

00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:40.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’d received from Jehovah.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To expand their ministry,

00:21:44.353 --> 00:21:46.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many Witnesses
have learned another language.

00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you?

00:21:48.657 --> 00:21:53.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, Jehovah knows
your selfless effort and hard work

00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach and teach in that language.

00:21:57.132 --> 00:22:00.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is preaching to people
in their native language

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:03.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sufficient to reach their heart?

00:22:03.872 --> 00:22:06.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see in this dramatization.

00:22:10.212 --> 00:22:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family had been learning Chinese
for over a year.

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy.

00:22:16.284 --> 00:22:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has many titles.

00:22:18.487 --> 00:22:21.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know he has only one name?

00:22:21.656 --> 00:22:34.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[Speaking Chinese]

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was ready, or at least I thought so.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew!

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:41.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’ll be right there.

00:22:48.016 --> 00:22:50.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were making progress,

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:52.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we weren’t giving up.

00:23:16.378 --> 00:23:20.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed like most people
just weren’t interested.

00:23:23.118 --> 00:23:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were not having a good morning.

00:23:33.128 --> 00:23:35.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:39.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Liz weren’t having
a good morning either.

00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Lin joined us.

00:23:44.873 --> 00:23:48.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been a big help to us.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:50.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We told them about our morning.

00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:54.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were finally able to converse a little
and give presentations,

00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:56.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything seemed to fall flat.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You ask good questions at the door

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:04.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not always the right one.

00:24:04.993 --> 00:24:07.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when you learn the language,

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:10.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not forget to learn about people.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was right.

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:19.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our questions started conversations
in our old territory, but not here.

00:24:20.442 --> 00:24:22.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your pronunciation is very good, see.

00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:23.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Brother Lin.

00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:26.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed a different approach

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we didn’t just learn the language

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how to reach the heart
of someone who speaks it.

00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:36.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the July 2019 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:39.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read about “Reaching the Hearts
of Nonreligious People.”

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:41.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in paragraph 7,

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:45.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you think that we could be more
like the apostle Paul?

00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:47.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul was a Jew,

00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:50.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when he was talking to other people,

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:52.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had to adapt his presentation.

00:24:52.474 --> 00:24:56.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like what 1 Corinthians 9:20-23 says:

00:24:56.811 --> 00:25:00.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the Jews I became as a Jew
in order to gain Jews;

00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:02.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those under law I became . . .”

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Liz was right.

00:25:04.553 --> 00:25:07.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Paul spoke to fellow Jews in Athens,

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:09.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reasoned from the Scriptures.

00:25:10.392 --> 00:25:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he spoke to the Greeks
at the Areopagus, he adapted,

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:16.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reasoning with them first without the Bible.

00:25:16.798 --> 00:25:19.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He later wrote:

00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:27.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I might by all possible means
save some.”

00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:30.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we needed to do.

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned more about the people.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:42.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to listen more
and talk about things

00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:45.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that interested them.

00:25:50.365 --> 00:25:53.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found different ways
to start conversations.

00:26:00.542 --> 00:26:03.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we kept learning more about the culture.

00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:06.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of a Chinese proverb I found says:

00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:09.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He who comes near ink is stained black.”

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a great way to introduce

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:13.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 13:20:

00:26:13.722 --> 00:26:17.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise.”

00:26:31.706 --> 00:26:35.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all comes down to showing love.

00:26:48.556 --> 00:26:52.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we paid attention
to how we were teaching,

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:57.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we were able to show people
the God who loves them.

00:27:03.004 --> 00:27:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder
that in the ministry,

00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:08.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to pay attention to people

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:12.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to what interests them
and to what helps them!

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we saw,

00:27:14.616 --> 00:27:18.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may need to analyze
and adapt our teaching methods,

00:27:18.653 --> 00:27:20.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Paul did.

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even as we endeavor to reach the hearts
of people in the ministry,

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:29.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must safeguard our own heart.

00:27:29.597 --> 00:27:31.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A recent <i>Watchtower</i> article

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered practical suggestions
to help us do that.

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:37.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next video,

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:41.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how our brothers
benefited from applying what they learned.

00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:59.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, very good friends of ours

00:27:59.961 --> 00:28:03.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided they wanted
to go their own way and leave Jehovah.

00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:07.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the interim,
they became bad association for us.

00:28:07.535 --> 00:28:09.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had many good times together.

00:28:09.971 --> 00:28:13.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We drove to isolated territory together;

00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:17.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we even visited a brother who was sick
in the hospital to encourage him.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:22.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel heartbroken

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:24.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re no longer serving Jehovah.

00:28:24.185 --> 00:28:27.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really hard to lose a friend spiritually
—very hard.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was about to enter into full-time service,

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:34.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still needed reassurance.

00:28:34.195 --> 00:28:38.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised by my mother as a Witness.

00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:41.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I had
very little contact with my father,

00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:43.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he still tried to oppose
my spiritual progress.

00:28:43.872 --> 00:28:46.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept fighting for the truth,

00:28:46.574 --> 00:28:49.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got baptized when I was 11.

00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:52.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I felt like I was doing OK.

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:55.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after high school, I went to university.

00:28:55.984 --> 00:29:00.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make some changes
in my choice of entertainment.

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:05.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really never stop learning.

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:09.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do enjoy relaxing and watching television.

00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:13.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I must admit
that it is more and more difficult

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:16.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find something decent to watch these days.

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not saying
that I watch bad programs.

00:29:19.874 --> 00:29:22.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never do that,

00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:25.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still I wonder

00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if what I watch
is spiritually healthy for me.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way of thinking
I was exposed to in university

00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:41.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was pressuring me to find security in my life
through material things

00:29:41.262 --> 00:29:44.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like having my own place to live
and economic stability.

00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at what cost?

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that paragraph.

00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:57.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that Satan promotes making money

00:29:57.412 --> 00:29:58.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the only way

00:29:58.413 --> 00:30:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can find security in this world.

00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:02.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one could sacrifice

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much to achieve it.

00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could even lose

00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:06.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your friendship with Jehovah.

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:09.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That article—it was just what we needed.

00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:12.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It described a watchman

00:30:12.126 --> 00:30:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would protect the city

00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:17.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sounding out an alarm on impending danger.

00:30:17.632 --> 00:30:19.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at sounding that alarm,

00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would shut the gates
to the city to protect the city.

00:30:22.971 --> 00:30:25.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I needed to do that.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We both needed to do that.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true.

00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:31.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not even a question.

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:33.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first

00:30:33.681 --> 00:30:37.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—before we’re loyal
to any friends we have in this world.

00:30:39.454 --> 00:30:41.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:43.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that storytelling

00:30:43.458 --> 00:30:46.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does more than entertain us.

00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:52.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bana, the city of Cameroon
where I was born,

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:56.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mothers spend their evenings
with their children, telling them stories.

00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:59.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though I was young,

00:30:59.474 --> 00:31:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stories my mother told me

00:31:02.677 --> 00:31:05.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to influence me even today.

00:31:05.647 --> 00:31:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said to myself: ‘Oh, no.
Wait a minute, Happy!

00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:13.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It means that the stories
that I watch on television

00:31:13.855 --> 00:31:17.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will also affect me sooner or later,

00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:19.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Devil knows that too.’

00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:23.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to completely cut out a number

00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:25.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of programs that I used to watch.

00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:29.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m serving in full-time service,

00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I love it!

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:34.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is really taking care of me,

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I don’t want to forget

00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beautiful principles
I’ve learned from that article.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still have to safeguard my heart.

00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:46.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to give my best to my Father, Jehovah.

00:31:46.521 --> 00:31:51.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a day goes by where we don’t think
about these friends of ours.

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:53.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s certainly our hope
that they come back to Jehovah

00:31:53.728 --> 00:31:56.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we can serve Jehovah
together shoulder to shoulder.

00:31:56.931 --> 00:31:59.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’ve also learned

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep our “little watchman” in check.

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:06.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to make sure he does his job
to “sound the alarm” and “shut those gates.”

00:32:06.407 --> 00:32:09.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, we never stop learning.

00:32:09.944 --> 00:32:13.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, true, it’s easier said than done,

00:32:13.114 --> 00:32:15.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is up to us.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so important to safeguard your heart!

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:35.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all enjoy reading <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:38.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and commenting at the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study.

00:32:38.272 --> 00:32:40.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But truly paying attention

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:44.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means putting what we learn into action.

00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:48.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else goes
into being a discerning student?

00:32:48.816 --> 00:32:52.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the topic
of a recent Morning Worship program

00:32:52.754 --> 00:32:55.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented by Brother Joel Dellinger.

00:32:56.858 --> 00:32:59.093 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our focus in the <i>Watchtower</i> study article

00:32:59.093 --> 00:33:00.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is on how we can unleash

00:33:00.695 --> 00:33:02.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the power of God’s Word

00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:05.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when teaching from the platform.

00:33:05.466 --> 00:33:07.135 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, whether we’re teaching

00:33:07.135 --> 00:33:09.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in a congregation setting,

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.939 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on a Bible study, or in the family,

00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:14.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that all of us,
brothers and sisters,

00:33:14.942 --> 00:33:18.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to ‘pay constant attention
to ourselves and to our teaching’?

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know why that’s so important
—because lives are at stake.

00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:27.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of us, younger or older,

00:33:27.155 --> 00:33:29.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touch the lives of other people.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we teach effectively,

00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:34.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are giving opportunity to others

00:33:34.729 --> 00:33:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attain the wisdom and the discernment
that God’s Word can give them.

00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:42.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we need to approach
any teaching opportunity

00:33:42.403 --> 00:33:45.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seriously and prayerfully.

00:33:45.973 --> 00:33:49.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me

00:33:49.077 --> 00:33:51.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some constructive counsel
after a public talk.

00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:54.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, with a warm smile, he said this,

00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:59.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, none of us teach like Jesus did.”

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ll never forget that counsel.

00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:05.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were those observations so helpful?

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it reminded me that when teaching,

00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:12.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our model needs to be Jesus,
the Great Teacher.

00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:14.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s more to learn from him.

00:34:14.268 --> 00:34:17.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus’ example reminds us of the need

00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain humble and diligent
students of Jehovah

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:24.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Grand Instructor.

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though all of us are teachers on occasion,

00:34:28.116 --> 00:34:30.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that most often

00:34:30.251 --> 00:34:33.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the role we play during spiritual programs

00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of students?

00:34:36.557 --> 00:34:40.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just for a moment, think about the many hours

00:34:40.061 --> 00:34:44.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we spend as students
—not teachers—

00:34:44.098 --> 00:34:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re in the audience
at congregation meetings,

00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:50.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at assemblies, and at conventions.

00:34:50.037 --> 00:34:53.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add to that the time we are students

00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:56.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we buy out time to watch
the monthly broadcast,

00:34:56.878 --> 00:35:01.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for meetings,
to engage in family and personal study.

00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:05.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then think of the added privilege
that many of us here have

00:35:05.052 --> 00:35:09.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to enjoy morning worship five days a week.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, a typical program
of morning worship

00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:14.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lasts between 20 to 25 minutes.

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:18.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you multiply that by 5 days a week
and then by 52 weeks,

00:35:18.399 --> 00:35:21.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a minimum, we are exposed

00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:24.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to at least 86 hours

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:27.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of divine instruction each year.

00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:29.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re not careful,

00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:33.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some or much of that valuable instruction,

00:35:33.014 --> 00:35:37.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouragement, and counsel
could just wash over us.

00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:40.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the remaining time
for our program this morning,

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:42.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider some things all of us can do

00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:45.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen more effectively

00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:47.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at spiritual programs.

00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:50.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, for our first point, open your Bible

00:35:50.097 --> 00:35:53.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Ezra 7:10,

00:35:53.334 --> 00:35:56.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s consider Ezra’s example.

00:35:56.637 --> 00:36:01.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Ezra 7:10,

00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:03.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the reading carefully:

00:36:03.845 --> 00:36:07.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ezra had prepared his heart

00:36:07.014 --> 00:36:09.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to consult the Law of Jehovah

00:36:09.517 --> 00:36:11.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to practice it,

00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:13.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to teach its regulations

00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:16.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and judgments in Israel.”

00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:19.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk

00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:22.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
next to “prepared his heart,”

00:36:22.063 --> 00:36:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you tap on that, you’ll notice
that that could be rendered as

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had determined in his heart.”

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from Ezra?

00:36:31.172 --> 00:36:35.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the right attitude
going into a period of study.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the right approach
to study and learning.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He recognized that it was Jehovah

00:36:41.883 --> 00:36:44.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be teaching him through His Law.

00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:48.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the verse goes on to say,
he first recognized

00:36:48.155 --> 00:36:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he needed to personally practice
what he was learning.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only then would he be in a rightful position

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to effectively teach others.

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:02.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this scripture emphasizes the point
we’ve already made, doesn’t it?

00:37:02.937 --> 00:37:05.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we are teachers on occasion,

00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:08.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are always first and foremost

00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
students of God’s Word.

00:37:11.545 --> 00:37:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate Ezra’s example

00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:17.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare our hearts before study,

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before attending a spiritual program

00:37:19.887 --> 00:37:22.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(whether here at Bethel
or in the congregation),

00:37:22.723 --> 00:37:26.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before watching a monthly broadcast?

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we need to prepare our hearts
by specifically praying to Jehovah,

00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:35.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizing him
as the Source of the teaching.

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:38.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we pray specifically about?

00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:43.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one, we want to pray
that we remain humble

00:37:43.477 --> 00:37:46.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while listening to theocratic instruction.

00:37:46.447 --> 00:37:48.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to listen

00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:51.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter how long
we’ve been in Jehovah’s classroom—

00:37:51.752 --> 00:37:54.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because none of us know it all,

00:37:54.422 --> 00:37:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will we ever know it all.

00:37:56.757 --> 00:37:59.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 1:5 reminds us

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:03.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “a wise person listens
and takes in more instruction.”

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:06.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this leads to another question:

00:38:06.734 --> 00:38:09.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we find we have
a somewhat negative attitude

00:38:09.737 --> 00:38:12.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward a certain presentation

00:38:12.073 --> 00:38:15.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps the material doesn’t interest us,

00:38:15.576 --> 00:38:19.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we have a negative attitude
toward a certain brother

00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:21.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his teaching ability?

00:38:21.048 --> 00:38:23.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we do?

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prepare our heart.

00:38:25.086 --> 00:38:29.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah
to recognize and appreciate

00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the instruction is from him.

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:35.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to have a thankful spirit.

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:39.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, back in 2002,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  made this helpful point

00:38:39.467 --> 00:38:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an article that was entitled
“Pay More Than the Usual Attention.”

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quote: “Some may tend to gauge
the quality of a meeting

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:50.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the teaching abilities
of the participants. . . .

00:38:50.211 --> 00:38:53.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though the teaching ability
of participants is important,

00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:57.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is not the sole factor contributing
to a meeting’s success.

00:38:57.685 --> 00:39:00.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you not agree
that our prime concern should be,

00:39:00.855 --> 00:39:03.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not how well the speaker delivers his talk,

00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:07.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but how well we incline our ear?

00:39:07.628 --> 00:39:10.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we attend meetings,”
the article continues,

00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:13.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pay attention
to what is being presented,

00:39:13.234 --> 00:39:16.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are worshiping God
in harmony with his will.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is what makes the meeting a success.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we are eager
to take in the knowledge of God,

00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:23.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we will benefit from meetings,

00:39:23.744 --> 00:39:27.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of a speaker’s abilities.”

00:39:27.348 --> 00:39:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder for all of us!

00:39:29.984 --> 00:39:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first point: Like Ezra,

00:39:32.319 --> 00:39:35.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s prepare our hearts with prayer,

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:39.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as students who are determined to always

00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:44.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accept and apply
what Jehovah has to teach us.

00:39:44.165 --> 00:39:46.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a second point:

00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:49.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need to focus our attention.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you faced the challenge
of staying focused

00:39:52.406 --> 00:39:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during spiritual programs?

00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:57.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our minds may be distracted

00:39:57.511 --> 00:40:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with anxieties and many other things.

00:40:00.548 --> 00:40:04.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noise and movements around us
could distract us.

00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:06.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re watching morning worship 

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a location other than
the Bethel dining room,

00:40:08.756 --> 00:40:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely we well know the numerous distractions

00:40:12.693 --> 00:40:15.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that fight for our attention.

00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:17.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us have ailments
and physical discomforts

00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:20.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may make it difficult to concentrate.

00:40:20.534 --> 00:40:23.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, a sister in our congregation

00:40:23.204 --> 00:40:27.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
told us about her long-term battle
with migraine headaches.

00:40:27.975 --> 00:40:30.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to put myself in her shoes,

00:40:30.644 --> 00:40:34.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a migraine headache
while attending a spiritual program

00:40:34.815 --> 00:40:37.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—difficult to concentrate.

00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:39.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whatever the case may be, we know
—we admit—

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are many challenges
and distractions.

00:40:42.056 --> 00:40:44.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do about it?

00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:47.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since the eyes strongly influence

00:40:47.094 --> 00:40:49.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we focus our attention,

00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:52.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Benefit</i>  book provides this suggestion:

00:40:52.099 --> 00:40:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use your eyes to help you concentrate
by keeping them on the speaker.

00:40:56.804 --> 00:40:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he cites a Bible text
—even a familiar one—

00:40:59.473 --> 00:41:02.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look it up, and follow along as he reads it.”

00:41:02.343 --> 00:41:05.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it said this:
“Resist the temptation to turn your head

00:41:05.913 --> 00:41:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the direction of every noise or movement.

00:41:08.816 --> 00:41:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the eyes are flooding your mind
with distracting information,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will miss much
of what is presented from the platform.”

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:21.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about, too,
the use of electronic devices.

00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:26.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been alerted,
messaged, or e-mailed

00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:29.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while looking at the Bible on your device?

00:41:29.436 --> 00:41:33.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wise it is when we turn
those devices to a mode

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that eliminates unnecessary distractions!

00:41:37.645 --> 00:41:41.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about anxieties
or disquieting thoughts?

00:41:41.182 --> 00:41:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could we do about that?

00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:46.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here, again, is where we can remember

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who the Grand Instructor is
and how close he can be to us

00:41:50.558 --> 00:41:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re in a teaching environment.

00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:57.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, your Bible to Psalm 94:19

00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:01.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recall what the psalmist said to Jehovah.

00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:05.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:42:07.174 --> 00:42:09.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read:

00:42:09.176 --> 00:42:11.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:16.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you [Jehovah] comforted and soothed me.”

00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:18.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder!

00:42:18.819 --> 00:42:21.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can soothe and comfort us

00:42:21.488 --> 00:42:23.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when attending spiritual programs

00:42:23.757 --> 00:42:27.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can focus
on what he’s teaching us.

00:42:27.528 --> 00:42:30.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, spiritual programs
are a provision from him

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a spiritual lifeline.

00:42:32.233 --> 00:42:35.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as needed during a spiritual program,

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should pray to Jehovah
to help us stay focused.

00:42:38.572 --> 00:42:41.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray repeatedly as needed.

00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in summary, what have we learned?

00:42:44.912 --> 00:42:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us are teachers from time to time,

00:42:47.915 --> 00:42:51.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but first and foremost, we are students

00:42:51.752 --> 00:42:55.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the classroom of the Great Teacher
and the Grand Instructor.

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Ezra, humility and appreciation

00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:02.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should move us to ‘prepare our hearts’
before every spiritual program.

00:43:02.963 --> 00:43:05.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to miss anything

00:43:05.966 --> 00:43:08.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has for us.

00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:10.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re determined ‘to consult that Law

00:43:10.704 --> 00:43:13.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can practice it
and then teach it.’

00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in view
of all the potential distractions,

00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:20.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s make it our aim to use
our eyes, our mind, and our heart

00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:25.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus attention on the goodness
of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions.

00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:31.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are a young Christian
who recently graduated from school

00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:33.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or will soon graduate,

00:43:33.927 --> 00:43:38.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll make many decisions
that will affect your future.

that let you
successfully run the race for life?

Don’t look back
To the things behind.

On that finish line.

Run the race; run the race.

All the blessings in store—

So let’s
Run the race; run the race.

for life.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This world would like
to have you turn around

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:48.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And lose yourself in this life.
But don’t let your hands drop down.

00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:52.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s
Run the race; run the race.

Volunteering
for theocratic construction projects

00:46:52.793 --> 00:46:54.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a goal for many.

00:46:54.795 --> 00:46:58.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, thousands of brothers and sisters

00:46:58.432 --> 00:47:01.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificed their time and energy

00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:05.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build a beautiful new
branch facility in Britain.

00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:08.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see
the results of their hard work

00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:11.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the blessings they received?

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:13.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy this report.

00:47:15.816 --> 00:47:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you feel
when all we came here to do

00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:22.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is finally completed?

00:47:22.523 --> 00:47:24.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, we will find a moment to reflect

00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the words of Philippians 2:13.

00:47:28.228 --> 00:47:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah energized us

00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave each and every one of us
“both the desire

00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:37.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power to act.”

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has sharing on this project
affected your life?

00:47:42.576 --> 00:47:45.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started over seven years ago.

00:48:00.894 --> 00:48:04.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how excited
you’re going to be

00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:08.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we hear
that the new branch facility at Chelmsford

00:48:08.035 --> 00:48:10.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been approved by the City Council?

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, guess what?

00:48:12.205 --> 00:48:16.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yesterday afternoon we received the approval.

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whilst the buildings are beautiful,

00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the day,
they are just buildings.

00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:53.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The really special part of this project

00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been the people;

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even non-Witnesses saw that something special

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was taking place on our site.

00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:04.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very friendly site to work on.

00:51:04.878 --> 00:51:06.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just how friendly everyone is.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You walk in, and it just—
I find it mind-blowing.

00:51:10.317 --> 00:51:12.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a negative (sometimes) society,

00:51:12.252 --> 00:51:15.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you come here,
it just puts a smile on your face.

00:51:15.388 --> 00:51:18.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A truly unexpected success

00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:20.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the visitors’ center.

00:51:20.393 --> 00:51:22.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we underestimated the appreciation

00:51:22.763 --> 00:51:25.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people have

00:51:25.098 --> 00:51:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for theocratic activities.

00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:30.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Visitors from all around the globe witnessed

00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:32.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the activities of Jehovah for themselves.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is partly why

00:51:35.942 --> 00:51:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m actually studying the Bible
to get baptized,

00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:42.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when I came here,
it just hit me somewhere, you know?

00:51:44.684 --> 00:51:47.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me and Alicia can’t see,

00:51:47.554 --> 00:51:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so everyone has been
so encouraging and thoughtful.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really feel like Jehovah is with us
and he’s supported us.

00:51:55.295 --> 00:51:59.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really liked the ladies driving tractors.

00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:04.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone wanted to have
a part in the project.

00:52:05.038 --> 00:52:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every single contribution warmed our hearts

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes our heads too.

00:52:12.479 --> 00:52:15.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another beautiful project highlight

00:52:15.348 --> 00:52:17.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the day-volunteer program.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:20.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The effort and expense brothers and sisters

00:52:20.453 --> 00:52:22.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificed reminded all of us

00:52:22.923 --> 00:52:26.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what a privilege it is
to work for Jehovah.

00:52:26.626 --> 00:52:29.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how about the commuters
who helped on the project?

00:52:29.763 --> 00:52:32.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would the BRD family have had

00:52:32.165 --> 00:52:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same spirit without our commuters?

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:41.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you just love being a part
of this amazing family?

00:52:45.178 --> 00:52:48.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were regularly reminded that spirituality

00:52:48.615 --> 00:52:50.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is of the utmost importance.

00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:53.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you ever say that a monthly meeting

00:52:53.653 --> 00:52:55.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best one yet?

00:52:56.523 --> 00:53:00.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lies outside the comfort zone

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the faith zone.

00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:04.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t cry because it’s over;

00:53:04.998 --> 00:53:07.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smile because it happened.

00:53:08.969 --> 00:53:12.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your story?

00:53:12.339 --> 00:53:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The center of all of our stories is Jehovah.

00:53:15.542 --> 00:53:18.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one who energized us;

00:53:18.345 --> 00:53:21.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is the one who gave us
both the desire

00:53:21.047 --> 00:53:23.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power to act.

00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one we can thank

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:27.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the lifelong friendships we have formed,

00:53:27.587 --> 00:53:29.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the training we have received,

00:53:29.389 --> 00:53:32.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the challenges
we have been able to overcome.

00:53:32.993 --> 00:53:35.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember your story.

00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:39.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, it’s only just beginning.

00:53:48.441 --> 00:53:50.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s program,

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:54.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned what it means
to pay attention to Jehovah.

00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:58.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how we can stay focused on Jehovah

00:53:58.685 --> 00:54:02.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite potential distractions.

00:54:02.355 --> 00:54:05.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders are good shepherds

00:54:05.292 --> 00:54:07.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they are attentive
to Jehovah’s instruction.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our ministry is more effective

00:54:13.767 --> 00:54:17.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we focus
on reaching the hearts of people.

00:54:18.204 --> 00:54:19.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song

00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:23.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds our young adults
to keep their eyes

00:54:23.643 --> 00:54:27.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the prize of life.

00:54:27.147 --> 00:54:29.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we say goodbye,

00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:32.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s go to the southwest tip of Japan

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visit our brothers and sisters
in the Ishigaki Congregation.

00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:41.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory includes the Yaeyama Islands,

00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:43.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an archipelago

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:47.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 12 islands
and more than 360 coral reefs.

00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:51.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emerald-green waters
surround these lush,

00:54:51.638 --> 00:54:53.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jungle-covered islands.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With almost no light pollution,

00:54:55.842 --> 00:54:59.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is an ideal place to observe

00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:01.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s beautiful heavenly creation.

00:55:03.483 --> 00:55:08.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vast distances between the islands
make the ministry a challenge.

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:11.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach remote communities,

00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:15.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publishers take ferries and small airplanes.

00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:19.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is costly,
and economic conditions here aren’t easy.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Transportation includes bicycles

00:55:24.337 --> 00:55:27.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as carts and wagons
pulled by water buffalo.
