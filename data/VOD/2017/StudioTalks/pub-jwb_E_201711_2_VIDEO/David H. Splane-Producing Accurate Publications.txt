00:00:01 This month I’d like to talk about the efforts
00:00:04 Jehovah’s organization is making
00:00:06 to produce literature, publications,
00:00:09 articles that are as accurate as possible.
00:00:13 We’re going to talk about accuracy —accuracy of statement.
00:00:18 Now, first, what’s the responsibility  of the writer of the article?
00:00:24 When a writer submits  an article for publication,
00:00:27 he is expected to supply references  from reputable sources
00:00:32 to back up the facts  that he’s included in his article.
00:00:35 And our Research Department  will use those references
00:00:37 to check the accuracy of everything.
00:00:40 Reliable, respected sources.
00:00:44 What do we mean by a reliable source?
00:00:47 Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias,
00:00:50 books, magazines, and then newspapers
00:00:55 —basically in that order.
00:00:58 We prefer encyclopedias over books,
00:01:01 books over magazines,
00:01:03 and magazines over newspapers
00:01:05 —generally because newspaper editors  have a hard time checking their facts.
00:01:09 They have a very limited time  in which to check their facts.
00:01:13 Even encyclopedias and books get updated,
00:01:17 so we have to go  with the latest edition of those.
00:01:20 We have to make sure  that our sources are reliable.
00:01:24 Now, when a writer quotes an expert,
00:01:27 our researchers will ask:  “Who’s this expert?
00:01:31 “What’s his reputation?
00:01:33 “Is he working for a particular organization?
00:01:36 “Does this organization have an agenda?
00:01:39 Is it a special-interest group?”
00:01:41 If we find that the goals  of the organization are questionable,
00:01:46 we won’t use the quote —even if it’s a really good quote.
00:01:51 Now, suppose that a writer  wants to quote something from a book.
00:01:55 In the reference material,
00:01:57 he’ll supply a photocopy  of the quote in the book,
00:02:00 but very often he’ll give us  two or three pages before the quote
00:02:04 and two or three pages after as well.
00:02:07 And that way,  our researchers can examine the quote
00:02:11 in context to make sure  that what we’re saying in print
00:02:15 is really what the author  of the quote had in mind.
00:02:18 For example,  an evolutionist might make a statement
00:02:22 which on the surface
00:02:24 appears to confirm his support of creation.
00:02:27 Or perhaps an atheist will make a statement
00:02:30 that seems to indicate  that he believes in God.
00:02:33 But when you examine  the quote in context,
00:02:36 you realize that that isn’t what  the author had in mind at all.
00:02:39 We would never  deliberately distort a quotation.
00:02:44 We try very hard to use all  of our quotations in context.
00:02:50 Now, it’s important to keep up  with the very latest research.
00:02:53 Something that was stated years ago  as a fact may have been disproved.
00:02:58 And the reason why is obvious.
00:03:00 Someone may spend his entire life
00:03:02 researching a very limited point in history
00:03:06 —a very small point in history—
00:03:08 and, of course,  if he spends so much time researching,
00:03:10 he’s going to uncover things.
00:03:12 And so it’s not surprising  that from time to time
00:03:15 we have to adjust our view  of some historical points.
00:03:19 We have to check, check, check.
00:03:21 And later on in this discussion,  we’re going to consider some examples of it.
00:03:26 It’ll be fun; you’ll love it!
00:03:28 Now, someone might ask,  ‘Why is it necessary to be so picky,
00:03:32 to be so fussy, about accuracy?’
00:03:36 And in answer,  I’d like to give an experience
00:03:39 that I heard about a few years ago.
00:03:42 In Northern Europe,  there was a man
00:03:44 who accepted a Bible study  from Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:47 And when he was asked
00:03:49 what motivated him  to want to study, he said:
00:03:52 “I read an article  in your Awake! magazine on trees.
00:03:55 “Now, I happen to be  a bit of an expert on trees.
00:03:59 “And after I read the article,  I said to myself:
00:04:02 “‘That article was so well-documented.
00:04:05 “‘It was so precise.
00:04:07 “‘Any organization that is that careful  when writing about trees
00:04:11 is going to be just as careful  when teaching me the Bible.’”
00:04:15 And on that basis,  he accepted a Bible study.
00:04:20 Now, an area where great care  needs to be taken
00:04:23 is when we’re quoting statistics.
00:04:26 A newspaper may report on a disaster  in a certain country
00:04:29 and say that 10,000 people  were killed in the disaster.
00:04:34 Immediately,  our researchers are going to ask,
00:04:37 “Where did they get that statistic?”
00:04:39 They might phone the newspaper  and ask for the source.
00:04:42 And if the reporter  can’t confirm the statistic,
00:04:45 our researchers will go to another source
00:04:48 —a more official source— to get the correct statistic.
00:04:53 Care is also taken  when quoting personalities of the past.
00:04:57 Now, suppose we want to quote  something that Napoleon Bonaparte said
00:05:02 —the French general.
00:05:04 Well, being French,  Napoleon spoke French.
00:05:07 So if we’re quoting it in English,
00:05:09 that means that somebody translated  the quote from French into English.
00:05:14 But did they translate the quote correctly?
00:05:18 Our researchers will probably go  to the target language
00:05:22 and research the quote  in French or in another language.
00:05:27 And more often than not,  they find that what is presented in English
00:05:32 doesn’t accurately represent  what the individual said at all.
00:05:37 Now, as we age,  our memory can play tricks on us.
00:05:41 And our researchers are aware of that.
00:05:44 Suppose that an elderly brother  writes in his life story
00:05:47 that he was baptized  at a circuit assembly on a certain date.
00:05:52 Our researchers may look at the date.
00:05:55 They may check the date,
00:05:57 and suppose they find that the date  the brother gave fell on a Tuesday.
00:06:01 Now, what are the chances that there was  a circuit assembly on a Tuesday?
00:06:06 There may have been,  but they’re going to check.
00:06:08 Is the brother’s memory failing him?
00:06:11 If they can’t confirm the date,
00:06:13 they may ask someone to help the brother
00:06:16 to remember the date  more correctly, more accurately.
00:06:19 Perhaps someone was baptized  at the same circuit assembly as he was,
00:06:23 and perhaps that person  has an accurate note of the date.
00:06:28 Our translators also go to great lengths
00:06:31 to present accurate information  to the brothers and sisters.
00:06:35 Some time ago,  the Awake! magazine published an article
00:06:38 on a very rare species of butterfly.
00:06:41 Now, with all animals and insects,
00:06:44 we provide our translators
00:06:46 with the Latin name  of the animal or the insect.
00:06:49 And so our translators had the Latin name.
00:06:52 But in one large country,
00:06:54 they were unable to find  the name in the vernacular.
00:06:57 So, what did they do?
00:06:59 They phoned the country’s leading university,
00:07:02 and they were transferred  to the Biology Department,
00:07:05 and there an expert gave them
00:07:07 the name in the vernacular  of that particular butterfly.
00:07:11 But then he said:  “Why is it that you’re worrying so much
00:07:14 “about the correct name of this butterfly?
00:07:16 “If you got it wrong,  there are only two of us
00:07:19 in the whole country  who would’ve known the difference.”
00:07:22 Well, that opened the way  to give a witness to this expert.
00:07:27 Well, now, how well would you do
00:07:29 in spotting a statement that is slightly off
00:07:32 and making it more accurate?
00:07:34 Would you like to find out?
00:07:36 Of course you would!  It’ll be fun.
00:07:39 So let’s take a quiz that I’ll call
00:07:41 You Be the Editor.
00:07:43 We’re going to put  a number of statements on the screen,
00:07:46 and there’s a problem  with each one of them.
00:07:48 Now your job  is to figure out what’s wrong,
00:07:51 why it is wrong,  and then suggest how to fix it.
00:07:55 It’s going to be fun.
00:07:57 Here’s the first statement:
00:07:59 “According  to the Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia,
00:08:04 “the Egyptian Sphinx
00:08:06 was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.”
00:08:10 “The Egyptian Sphinx
00:08:13 was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.”
00:08:17 Well, the problem
00:08:19 is with the date 2550 B.C.E.
00:08:21 The global Flood occurred
00:08:23 about 200 years after that date.
00:08:26 So, what are the chances  that the Sphinx survived the Flood?
00:08:31 Unless, of course, you think  that’s how the Sphinx lost his nose.
00:08:35 Now, these dates  are good for you school children
00:08:38 to keep in mind  when you’re writing reports.
00:08:40 Sometimes you copy something  from an encyclopedia,
00:08:43 and it gives a certain date.
00:08:45 But think about the date of the Flood,
2370 B.C.E.,
00:08:48 so that what you put in your report  is as accurate as possible.
00:08:54 Now let’s go on to the next one:
00:08:57 “In 29 C.E.,
00:08:59 “Jesus was baptized by a close relative,
00:09:03 John the Baptizer.”
00:09:06 Well, 29 C.E., that looks right.
00:09:09 And we know that Jesus
00:09:11 was baptized by John; that’s right.
00:09:13 So the problem must be
00:09:15 “close relative,” and it is.
00:09:18 Now, both of Jesus’ parents
00:09:20 were of the tribe of Judah,  and their parents were of the tribe of Judah.
00:09:25 But, what about John’s parents,  Zechariah and Elizabeth?
00:09:29 They were both of the tribe of Levi.
00:09:31 So Elizabeth and Mary  couldn’t have been sisters.
00:09:34 Could they have been cousins?
00:09:36 Maybe.
00:09:37 We can’t even confirm that.
00:09:39 And if they were, that would make  Jesus and John second cousins.
00:09:43 Well, is a second cousin a “close relative”?
00:09:46 Some would say yes;  some would say no.
00:09:49 So it’s safer just to say,
00:09:51 “In 29 C.E.,  Jesus was baptized by a relative,
00:09:56 John the Baptizer.”
00:09:58 Here’s one.
00:09:59 Let’s see if you can spot  the error in this one:
00:10:02 “While most of the early Christians
00:10:04 “were held in little esteem in the community,
00:10:07 “a few enjoyed an elevated social status.
00:10:10 For example, Luke was a respected physician.”
00:10:16 Well, the word we need
00:10:18 to look at is “respected.”
00:10:20 We respect our doctors today,
00:10:23 and our doctors have  a very, very fine education.
00:10:26 But was that the case in the first century?
00:10:29 A reference work says this  about first-century physicians:
00:10:34 “Many doctors were freed Greek slaves,
00:10:37 “hence the social standing  of doctors was quite low.
00:10:42 “Because recovery rates were so low,
00:10:45 many people were skeptical  or even scornful of doctors.”
00:10:48 Note this statement from the first century:
00:10:51 “Until recently, Diaulus was a doctor;
00:10:55 “now he is an undertaker.
00:10:58 “He is still doing as an undertaker,
00:11:00 what he used to do as a doctor.”
00:11:03 Not very flattering, is it?
00:11:05 Well, in this case, we’d probably have to use  a different example.
00:11:09 Here’s one:
00:11:11 “In 325 C.E.,
00:11:14 “the Roman Emperor Constantine
00:11:16 “established Christianity
00:11:18 “as the official religion
00:11:20 of the Roman Empire.”
00:11:23 Well, 325 C.E., that looks right.
00:11:26 And Constantine, that looks right.
00:11:29 But look at the word “official”
00:11:32 —“official religion.”
00:11:35 Constantine never established Christianity
00:11:38 as the official religion  of the Roman Empire.
00:11:41 In 313 C.E.,  he did make it legal to be a Christian,
00:11:45 but paganism was still  one of the official religions.
00:11:48 Apostate Christianity  didn’t become the official religion
00:11:52 until 391 C.E.
00:11:55 This one is tricky.
00:11:57 See how you do with this one:
00:11:59 “Imagine the apostle Paul
00:12:01 “during his first imprisonment in Rome,
00:12:04 “writing his letter to the Colossians
00:12:06 from a dark prison cell.”
00:12:10 Well, if you look in the back  of the New World Translation,
00:12:12 you’ll find that Paul did write his letter  to the Colossians while in Rome,
00:12:16 and he was imprisoned at the time.
00:12:20 So, what’s the problem?
00:12:22 “Dark prison cell.”
00:12:24 Where was Paul  during his first imprisonment?
00:12:27 In his own rented house.
00:12:30 So the statement “dark prison cell,”
00:12:32 it’s very dramatic, but it’s all wrong.
00:12:36 Here’s an old one:
00:12:39 “While Paul generally preached
00:12:41 “to people of the nations,
00:12:43 “Peter was sent to the Jews.
00:12:45 “Contrary to popular belief,
00:12:47 Peter was never in Rome.”
00:12:50 Some scholars used to make that statement,
00:12:53 and they made it 60 years ago:
00:12:55 “Peter was never in Rome.”
00:12:58 But can we really say that?
00:13:00 Can we be that dogmatic?
00:13:02 Can we say that he didn’t even spend
00:13:05 vacation time or have a short visit in Rome?
00:13:07 No, we cannot.
00:13:09 So it would be more accurate to state:
00:13:11 “There is no record  that Peter ever lived in Rome.”
00:13:17 Here’s one:
00:13:18 “We can have confidence in the Bible
00:13:21 —it is mankind’s oldest book.”
00:13:25 “Mankind’s oldest book.”
00:13:28 Years ago, some scholars believed
00:13:31 that texts written  by Adam, Noah, and others
00:13:35 survived the Flood  and became part of the Bible.
00:13:37 And if that were true,
00:13:39 then we could say that the Bible  is mankind’s oldest book.
00:13:44 Now, here’s a quote  from Insight on the Scriptures,
00:13:46 our Bible encyclopedia.
00:13:48 It says:  “There is no way to establish definitely
00:13:53 “that some of the histories  mentioned in the book of Genesis
00:13:55 were committed to writing  before the Flood.”
00:13:59 So, today we might call the Bible  one of mankind’s oldest books
00:14:03 or the world’s oldest modern book,
00:14:06 as we do in one of our videos.
00:14:09 Here’s the last one:
00:14:11 “In 1517,
00:14:13 “Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses
00:14:17 on the door of a church  in Wittenberg, Germany.”
00:14:22 Well, we’ve highlighted “95,”
00:14:24 but there are questions  about the entire statement.
00:14:27 Some modern scholars have done
00:14:29 a tremendous, exhaustive study  of the life of Martin Luther,
00:14:32 and they claim  that he couldn’t have compiled
00:14:35 all 95 of his theses by 1517.
00:14:40 Others go so far as to claim  that it never happened
00:14:44 —that he never did nail his theses  on the door of the church.
00:14:48 Still others are just as adamant  that it’s all true
00:14:51 —that it all happened.
00:14:53 So there’s no consensus.
00:14:55 We would have to modify the statement
00:14:58 —“some believe” or “it is believed”—
00:15:01 in order to make it more accurate
00:15:03 and to acknowledge the fact  that there are differences of opinion.
00:15:08 Well, how did you do on the quiz?
00:15:11 If you’re like me, you’ve probably made  some of those statements yourself at times.
00:15:15 The statements were based  on the best research we had at the time.
00:15:19 But this is to illustrate  the fact that times change;
00:15:23 research facilities improve.
00:15:26 A scholar does exhaustive research  on one point of history,
00:15:30 and he uncovers things  that were previously unknown.
00:15:34 So we have to keep up.
00:15:36 We have to check, check, check.
00:15:38 And when credible research  reveals that we have to adjust
00:15:42 or tweak a statement  that we made in the past,
00:15:45 we do so without hesitation.
00:15:48 Our goal is to provide information  that is as accurate as possible
00:15:53 because we know that you  brothers and sisters use this information.
00:15:56 You quote it in the field ministry.
00:15:58 You use it in your public talks.
00:16:00 So we want to make sure  that our brothers are fed
00:16:02 with the most accurate  spiritual food possible.
00:16:07 We’re imperfect, of course,  and we are going to make mistakes.
00:16:10 And when we do,  we have to correct them.
00:16:13 Our goal is to do the best we can  in all our imperfection.
00:16:19 Well, how does it make you feel?
00:16:22 I know how it makes me feel.
00:16:24 I’m grateful that Jehovah’s organization  takes accuracy so seriously.
00:16:29 It gives me confidence.
00:16:31 And, you know, I’m reminded  of the description of another researcher,
00:16:35 as recorded at Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10.
00:16:42 You know who this is.
00:16:44 Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10:
00:16:48 “Not only had the congregator become wise
00:16:52 “but he continually taught  the people what he knew,
00:16:56 “and he pondered
00:16:58 “and made a thorough search
00:17:01 “in order to compile many proverbs.
00:17:04 “The congregator sought  to find delightful words
00:17:07 and to record accurate words of truth.”
