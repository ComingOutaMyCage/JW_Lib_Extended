00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:04.320 line:10% position:50% align:center
This month I’d like to talk about the efforts

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.322 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization is making

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:09.726 line:10% position:50% align:center
to produce literature, publications,

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:13.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
articles that are as accurate as possible.

00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to talk about accuracy
—accuracy of statement.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:23.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first, what’s the responsibility 
of the writer of the article?

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a writer submits 
an article for publication,

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is expected to supply references 
from reputable sources

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:35.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
to back up the facts 
that he’s included in his article.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our Research Department 
will use those references

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
to check the accuracy of everything.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:44.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reliable, respected sources.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by a reliable source?

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias,

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:55.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
books, magazines, and then newspapers

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—basically in that order.

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prefer encyclopedias over books,

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
books over magazines,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and magazines over newspapers

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
—generally because newspaper editors 
have a hard time checking their facts.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a very limited time 
in which to check their facts.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:17.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even encyclopedias and books get updated,

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we have to go 
with the latest edition of those.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to make sure 
that our sources are reliable.

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when a writer quotes an expert,

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
our researchers will ask: 
“Who’s this expert?

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What’s his reputation?

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:36.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is he working for a particular organization?

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does this organization have an agenda?

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it a special-interest group?”

00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find that the goals 
of the organization are questionable,

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t use the quote
—even if it’s a really good quote.

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, suppose that a writer 
wants to quote something from a book.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the reference material,

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll supply a photocopy 
of the quote in the book,

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:04.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
but very often he’ll give us 
two or three pages before the quote

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:07.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two or three pages after as well.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that way, 
our researchers can examine the quote

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:15.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
in context to make sure 
that what we’re saying in print

00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:18.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really what the author 
of the quote had in mind.

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, 
an evolutionist might make a statement

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:24.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
which on the surface

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
appears to confirm his support of creation.

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps an atheist will make a statement

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seems to indicate 
that he believes in God.

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:36.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when you examine 
the quote in context,

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:39.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
you realize that that isn’t what 
the author had in mind at all.

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:44.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never 
deliberately distort a quotation.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
We try very hard to use all 
of our quotations in context.

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:53.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s important to keep up 
with the very latest research.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:58.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that was stated years ago 
as a fact may have been disproved.

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the reason why is obvious.

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:02.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone may spend his entire life

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:06.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
researching a very limited point in history

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very small point in history—

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, 
if he spends so much time researching,

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s going to uncover things.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s not surprising 
that from time to time

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to adjust our view 
of some historical points.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to check, check, check.

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later on in this discussion, 
we’re going to consider some examples of it.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll be fun; you’ll love it!

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, someone might ask, 
‘Why is it necessary to be so picky,

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be so fussy, about accuracy?’

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in answer, 
I’d like to give an experience

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I heard about a few years ago.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Northern Europe, 
there was a man

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
who accepted a Bible study 
from Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:49.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when he was asked

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
what motivated him 
to want to study, he said:

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I read an article 
in your Awake! magazine on trees.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I happen to be 
a bit of an expert on trees.

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:02.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And after I read the article, 
I said to myself:

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘That article was so well-documented.

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:07.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was so precise.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Any organization that is that careful 
when writing about trees

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:15.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be just as careful 
when teaching me the Bible.’”

00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on that basis, 
he accepted a Bible study.

00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:23.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, an area where great care 
needs to be taken

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when we’re quoting statistics.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:29.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
A newspaper may report on a disaster 
in a certain country

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:34.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say that 10,000 people 
were killed in the disaster.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately, 
our researchers are going to ask,

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where did they get that statistic?”

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:42.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
They might phone the newspaper 
and ask for the source.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if the reporter 
can’t confirm the statistic,

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
our researchers will go to another source

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a more official source—
to get the correct statistic.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Care is also taken 
when quoting personalities of the past.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:02.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, suppose we want to quote 
something that Napoleon Bonaparte said

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:04.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the French general.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, being French, 
Napoleon spoke French.

00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we’re quoting it in English,

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:14.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means that somebody translated 
the quote from French into English.

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did they translate the quote correctly?

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:22.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our researchers will probably go 
to the target language

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:27.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and research the quote 
in French or in another language.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more often than not, 
they find that what is presented in English

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t accurately represent 
what the individual said at all.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we age, 
our memory can play tricks on us.

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:43.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our researchers are aware of that.

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:47.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose that an elderly brother 
writes in his life story

00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:52.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was baptized 
at a circuit assembly on a certain date.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our researchers may look at the date.

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:57.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may check the date,

00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:01.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suppose they find that the date 
the brother gave fell on a Tuesday.

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what are the chances that there was 
a circuit assembly on a Tuesday?

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:08.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may have been, 
but they’re going to check.

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:11.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the brother’s memory failing him?

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:13.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they can’t confirm the date,

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:16.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may ask someone to help the brother

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remember the date 
more correctly, more accurately.

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:23.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps someone was baptized 
at the same circuit assembly as he was,

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps that person 
has an accurate note of the date.

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our translators also go to great lengths

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
to present accurate information 
to the brothers and sisters.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time ago, 
the Awake! magazine published an article

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:41.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a very rare species of butterfly.

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with all animals and insects,

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
we provide our translators

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:49.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Latin name 
of the animal or the insect.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so our translators had the Latin name.

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in one large country,

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:57.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were unable to find 
the name in the vernacular.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did they do?

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:02.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
They phoned the country’s leading university,

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:05.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were transferred 
to the Biology Department,

00:07:05.374 --> 00:07:07.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there an expert gave them

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:11.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
the name in the vernacular 
of that particular butterfly.

00:07:11.314 --> 00:07:14.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he said: 
“Why is it that you’re worrying so much

00:07:14.617 --> 00:07:16.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about the correct name of this butterfly?

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you got it wrong, 
there are only two of us

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:22.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the whole country 
who would’ve known the difference.”

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:26.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that opened the way 
to give a witness to this expert.

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:29.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, how well would you do

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:32.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spotting a statement that is slightly off

00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:34.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making it more accurate?

00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to find out?

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course you would! 
It’ll be fun.

00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:41.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s take a quiz that I’ll call

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Be the Editor.

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:46.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to put 
a number of statements on the screen,

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s a problem 
with each one of them.

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now your job 
is to figure out what’s wrong,

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
why it is wrong, 
and then suggest how to fix it.

00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:57.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to be fun.

00:07:57.994 --> 00:07:59.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the first statement:

00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:04.066 line:10% position:50% align:center
“According 
to the Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia,

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.102 line:10% position:50% align:center
“the Egyptian Sphinx

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:10.473 line:10% position:50% align:center
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.”

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:13.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The Egyptian Sphinx

00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:17.446 line:10% position:50% align:center
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.”

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:19.482 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, the problem

00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:21.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
is with the date 2550 B.C.E.

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:23.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
The global Flood occurred

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:26.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 200 years after that date.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are the chances 
that the Sphinx survived the Flood?

00:08:31.294 --> 00:08:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unless, of course, you think 
that’s how the Sphinx lost his nose.

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these dates 
are good for you school children

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep in mind 
when you’re writing reports.

00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:43.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you copy something 
from an encyclopedia,

00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:45.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it gives a certain date.

00:08:45.074 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think about the date of the Flood,
2370 B.C.E.,

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that what you put in your report 
is as accurate as possible.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s go on to the next one:

00:08:57.486 --> 00:08:59.488 line:10% position:50% align:center
“In 29 C.E.,

00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:03.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Jesus was baptized by a close relative,

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:05.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
John the Baptizer.”

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:09.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, 29 C.E., that looks right.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we know that Jesus

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.369 line:10% position:50% align:center
was baptized by John; that’s right.

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:15.404 line:10% position:50% align:center
So the problem must be

00:09:15.404 --> 00:09:18.507 line:10% position:50% align:center
“close relative,” and it is.

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:20.876 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, both of Jesus’ parents

00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:25.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
were of the tribe of Judah, 
and their parents were of the tribe of Judah.

00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:29.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, what about John’s parents, 
Zechariah and Elizabeth?

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:31.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were both of the tribe of Levi.

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:34.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elizabeth and Mary 
couldn’t have been sisters.

00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:36.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could they have been cousins?

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t even confirm that.

00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:43.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if they were, that would make 
Jesus and John second cousins.

00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:46.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, is a second cousin a “close relative”?

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:49.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some would say yes; 
some would say no.

00:09:49.272 --> 00:09:51.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s safer just to say,

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In 29 C.E., 
Jesus was baptized by a relative,

00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:58.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
John the Baptizer.”

00:09:58.848 --> 00:09:59.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one.

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:02.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see if you can spot 
the error in this one:

00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:04.720 line:10% position:50% align:center
“While most of the early Christians

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.490 line:10% position:50% align:center
“were held in little esteem in the community,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.893 line:10% position:50% align:center
“a few enjoyed an elevated social status.

00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:15.231 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example, Luke was a respected physician.”

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:18.100 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, the word we need

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.803 line:10% position:50% align:center
to look at is “respected.”

00:10:20.803 --> 00:10:23.539 line:10% position:50% align:center
We respect our doctors today,

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our doctors have 
a very, very fine education.

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:29.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was that the case in the first century?

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:34.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
A reference work says this 
about first-century physicians:

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many doctors were freed Greek slaves,

00:10:37.753 --> 00:10:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
“hence the social standing 
of doctors was quite low.

00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because recovery rates were so low,

00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:48.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people were skeptical 
or even scornful of doctors.”

00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note this statement from the first century:

00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:55.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Until recently, Diaulus was a doctor;

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:58.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now he is an undertaker.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is still doing as an undertaker,

00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:03.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he used to do as a doctor.”

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:05.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not very flattering, is it?

00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this case, we’d probably have to use 
a different example.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one:

00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:14.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
“In 325 C.E.,

00:11:14.357 --> 00:11:16.359 line:10% position:50% align:center
“the Roman Emperor Constantine

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:18.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
“established Christianity

00:11:18.394 --> 00:11:20.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
“as the official religion

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:22.398 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Roman Empire.”

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:26.702 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, 325 C.E., that looks right.

00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:29.705 line:10% position:50% align:center
And Constantine, that looks right.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:32.074 line:10% position:50% align:center
But look at the word “official”

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:34.744 line:10% position:50% align:center
—“official religion.”

00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:38.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Constantine never established Christianity

00:11:38.314 --> 00:11:41.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the official religion 
of the Roman Empire.

00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:45.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 313 C.E., 
he did make it legal to be a Christian,

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:48.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
but paganism was still 
one of the official religions.

00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apostate Christianity 
didn’t become the official religion

00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:54.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
until 391 C.E.

00:11:55.531 --> 00:11:57.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one is tricky.

00:11:57.533 --> 00:11:59.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
See how you do with this one:

00:11:59.902 --> 00:12:01.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Imagine the apostle Paul

00:12:01.904 --> 00:12:04.707 line:10% position:50% align:center
“during his first imprisonment in Rome,

00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:06.976 line:10% position:50% align:center
“writing his letter to the Colossians

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.478 line:10% position:50% align:center
from a dark prison cell.”

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:12.948 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, if you look in the back 
of the New World Translation,

00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:16.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
you’ll find that Paul did write his letter 
to the Colossians while in Rome,

00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:20.222 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he was imprisoned at the time.

00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:22.591 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the problem?

00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:24.894 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Dark prison cell.”

00:12:24.894 --> 00:12:27.730 line:10% position:50% align:center
Where was Paul 
during his first imprisonment?

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his own rented house.

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:32.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the statement “dark prison cell,”

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:35.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very dramatic, but it’s all wrong.

00:12:36.739 --> 00:12:39.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an old one:

00:12:39.308 --> 00:12:41.310 line:10% position:50% align:center
“While Paul generally preached

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.312 line:10% position:50% align:center
“to people of the nations,

00:12:43.312 --> 00:12:45.381 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Peter was sent to the Jews.

00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:47.950 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Contrary to popular belief,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.853 line:10% position:50% align:center
Peter was never in Rome.”

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:53.522 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some scholars used to make that statement,

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
and they made it 60 years ago:

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.594 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Peter was never in Rome.”

00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:00.596 line:10% position:50% align:center
But can we really say that?

00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:02.798 line:10% position:50% align:center
Can we be that dogmatic?

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:05.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we say that he didn’t even spend

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:07.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
vacation time or have a short visit in Rome?

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we cannot.

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it would be more accurate to state:

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:15.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no record 
that Peter ever lived in Rome.”

00:13:17.112 --> 00:13:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one:

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:21.617 line:10% position:50% align:center
“We can have confidence in the Bible

00:13:21.617 --> 00:13:25.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
—it is mankind’s oldest book.”

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Mankind’s oldest book.”

00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
Years ago, some scholars believed

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:35.364 line:10% position:50% align:center
that texts written 
by Adam, Noah, and others

00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:37.833 line:10% position:50% align:center
survived the Flood 
and became part of the Bible.

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.835 line:10% position:50% align:center
And if that were true,

00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:43.506 line:10% position:50% align:center
then we could say that the Bible 
is mankind’s oldest book.

00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a quote 
from Insight on the Scriptures,

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:48.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Bible encyclopedia.

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:53.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: 
“There is no way to establish definitely

00:13:53.048 --> 00:13:55.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that some of the histories 
mentioned in the book of Genesis

00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
were committed to writing 
before the Flood.”

00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:03.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, today we might call the Bible 
one of mankind’s oldest books

00:14:03.392 --> 00:14:06.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the world’s oldest modern book,

00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we do in one of our videos.

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the last one:

00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:13.736 line:10% position:50% align:center
“In 1517,

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.172 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses

00:14:17.172 --> 00:14:20.743 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the door of a church 
in Wittenberg, Germany.”

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.380 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve highlighted “95,”

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.316 line:10% position:50% align:center
but there are questions 
about the entire statement.

00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:29.952 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some modern scholars have done

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.955 line:10% position:50% align:center
a tremendous, exhaustive study 
of the life of Martin Luther,

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they claim 
that he couldn’t have compiled

00:14:35.658 --> 00:14:40.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
all 95 of his theses by 1517.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:44.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others go so far as to claim 
that it never happened

00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:48.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that he never did nail his theses 
on the door of the church.

00:14:48.003 --> 00:14:51.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still others are just as adamant 
that it’s all true

00:14:51.407 --> 00:14:53.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that it all happened.

00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:55.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s no consensus.

00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:58.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would have to modify the statement

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“some believe” or “it is believed”—

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to make it more accurate

00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:06.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to acknowledge the fact 
that there are differences of opinion.

00:15:08.357 --> 00:15:11.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did you do on the quiz?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re like me, you’ve probably made 
some of those statements yourself at times.

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
The statements were based 
on the best research we had at the time.

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:23.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is to illustrate 
the fact that times change;

00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
research facilities improve.

00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:30.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
A scholar does exhaustive research 
on one point of history,

00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:34.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he uncovers things 
that were previously unknown.

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:36.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to keep up.

00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to check, check, check.

00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:42.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when credible research 
reveals that we have to adjust

00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:45.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
or tweak a statement 
that we made in the past,

00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do so without hesitation.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal is to provide information 
that is as accurate as possible

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:56.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know that you 
brothers and sisters use this information.

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
You quote it in the field ministry.

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
You use it in your public talks.

00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:02.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to make sure 
that our brothers are fed

00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:07.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the most accurate 
spiritual food possible.

00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:10.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re imperfect, of course, 
and we are going to make mistakes.

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:13.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do, 
we have to correct them.

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:18.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal is to do the best we can 
in all our imperfection.

00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:22.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does it make you feel?

00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know how it makes me feel.

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:29.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m grateful that Jehovah’s organization 
takes accuracy so seriously.

00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:31.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me confidence.

00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:35.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know, I’m reminded 
of the description of another researcher,

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:42.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10.

00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know who this is.

00:16:44.286 --> 00:16:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10:

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:52.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not only had the congregator become wise

00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:56.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but he continually taught 
the people what he knew,

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:58.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he pondered

00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:01.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and made a thorough search

00:17:01.904 --> 00:17:04.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to compile many proverbs.

00:17:04.873 --> 00:17:07.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The congregator sought 
to find delightful words

00:17:07.743 --> 00:17:11.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to record accurate words of truth.”
