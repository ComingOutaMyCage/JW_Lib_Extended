00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to the book of Esther.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
Esther is the second of two Bible books

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:10.239 line:10% position:50% align:center
bearing a woman’s name.

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jewish woman Esther
is featured prominently in the account,

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was most likely written by Mordecai,
Esther’s older cousin.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:21.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Esther was orphaned,

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:24.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mordecai became her guardian.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esther and Mordecai became part
of the court of King Ahasuerus.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
The royal court was in Shushan.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.723 line:10% position:50% align:center
The city of Shushan was located

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:37.641 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the heart of the Persian Empire,

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
which spanned from India to Ethiopia.

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:43.606 line:10% position:50% align:center
The book of Esther records events

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.150 line:10% position:50% align:center
that began in 493 B.C.E.

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.779 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was written about 475 B.C.E.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:52.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
and completed before the books

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:54.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Ezra and Nehemiah were written.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:58.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
In Esther’s day, a small remnant of Jews

00:00:58.412 --> 00:00:59.705 line:10% position:50% align:center
had already returned

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.707 line:10% position:50% align:center
to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem,

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:03.667 line:10% position:50% align:center
but many others still lived

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
throughout the Persian Empire.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Esther contains ten chapters.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 1 and 2
record the Persian king’s search

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the empire for a new queen.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esther was finally chosen.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:23.020 line:10% position:50% align:center
Chapters 3 to 7 disclose how Haman,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.105 line:10% position:50% align:center
an enemy of God’s people,

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.566 line:10% position:50% align:center
rose to the position of prime minister

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.653 line:10% position:50% align:center
and hatched a plot to annihilate the Jews.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.906 line:10% position:50% align:center
Haman used the king’s signet ring

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:35.324 line:10% position:50% align:center
to seal a decree

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
ordering the death of all the Jews,

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:39.578 line:10% position:50% align:center
including Mordecai.

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:43.082 line:10% position:50% align:center
If successful, Haman’s plan

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.959 line:10% position:50% align:center
would have cut off the family line

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
leading to the Messiah.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:49.296 line:10% position:50% align:center
Upon learning of the plot,

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:52.299 line:10% position:50% align:center
Esther decided to follow Mordecai’s advice

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.468 line:10% position:50% align:center
and approach King Ahasuerus.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appearing before the king unsummoned

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have meant a death sentence.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only if the king held out his golden scepter

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
could the offender be spared.

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.903 line:10% position:50% align:center
Esther courageously approached the king

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.822 line:10% position:50% align:center
and exposed the wicked plot.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:16.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
Upon learning of it,

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.450 line:10% position:50% align:center
the king was so furious

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.452 line:10% position:50% align:center
that he had Haman executed.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.664 line:10% position:50% align:center
Chapters 8 to 10 relate

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:26.250 line:10% position:50% align:center
how Mordecai is appointed prime minister

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.252 line:10% position:50% align:center
in place of Haman.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:30.546 line:10% position:50% align:center
Esther and Mordecai

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
enacted a new legal decree,

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
sealed with the king’s own signet ring,

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:36.719 line:10% position:50% align:center
that authorized the Jews

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.846 line:10% position:50% align:center
to defend themselves when attacked.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.142 line:10% position:50% align:center
The decree was sent throughout the empire.

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.146 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave the Jews a great victory

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:49.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
and preserved the family line

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:50.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
leading to the Messiah.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:53.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read this book,

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
note how Mordecai and Esther

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:57.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
skillfully used the Persian legal system

00:02:57.823 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect the Jews,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah can deliver his people

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:04.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of any situation,

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how young Esther

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
courageously risked her life

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect God’s people

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the family line leading to the Messiah.
