00:00:02 An introduction to the book of Job.
00:00:06 This book is grouped
00:00:07 with four other poetic books,
00:00:09 and it is among
00:00:10 the oldest books in the Bible.
00:00:14 It was completed by Moses
00:00:16 about 1473 B.C.E.,
00:00:19 toward the end of the Israelites’
00:00:21 40-year trek in the wilderness.
00:00:24 The man Job lived in Uz.
00:00:26 Shem, a forefather of Abraham,
00:00:29 was likely an ancestor of Job as well.
00:00:33 Even though Job was not an Israelite,
00:00:35 he was a worshipper of Jehovah.
00:00:41 Job was very wealthy.
00:00:44 He had many servants and owned thousands of sheep,
00:00:47 camels, and other livestock.
00:00:50 He and his wife had ten children,
00:00:52 and he was highly respected in his community.
00:00:56 However, all of this was lost
00:00:59 because of a series of tragic events!
00:01:03 At the time Job’s trials took place,
00:01:06 Jehovah said that there
00:01:07 was ‘no one like Job on the earth.’
00:01:11 Therefore, we can place these events
00:01:13 after the death of the faithful man Joseph
00:01:16 but before Moses became leader over Israel.
00:01:21 The book of Job contains 42 chapters.
00:01:25 Chapters 1 and 2 reveal events that took place in the heavens.
00:01:30 Satan challenged Jehovah
00:01:32 and claimed that Job would not remain faithful
00:01:35 when faced with adversity.
00:01:38 Chapters 3 to 31 contain several rounds of debates
00:01:42 between Job and his three companions:
00:01:44 Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.
00:01:48 Eliphaz ridiculed Job’s integrity
00:01:51 and implied that man is useless to God.
00:01:55 Bildad suggested that Job
00:01:57 was suffering as punishment for his sins.
00:02:01 Zophar harshly insinuated
00:02:03 that Job was wicked.
00:02:06 Job attempted to defend himself
00:02:08 from these accusations,
00:02:10 but in doing so,
00:02:12 he made incorrect statements about Jehovah.
00:02:16 In chapters 32 to 37,
00:02:19 after listening to what Job
00:02:21 and his companions had to say,
00:02:23 the young man Elihu offers wise counsel.
00:02:28 Then in chapters 38 to 41, Jehovah,
00:02:31 speaking out of a windstorm, corrects Job’s thinking
00:02:35 with thought-provoking questions about creation.
00:02:40 Did you know?
00:02:42 The book of Job describes the earth
00:02:45 as suspended upon nothing,
00:02:47 a fact that was not widely recognized
00:02:49 until centuries later.
00:02:53 In the final chapter,
00:02:55 God commands Job’s three companions to offer a sacrifice
00:02:59 and tells them that Job will pray in their behalf.
00:03:04 Jehovah then restored Job’s health and reputation,
00:03:08 gave him double the wealth he had before,
00:03:11 blessed him with seven more sons and three more daughters,
00:03:15 and allowed him to live for an additional 140 years.
00:03:20 As you read this book,
00:03:22 pay attention to how this account proves
00:03:25 that Jehovah is not the cause of human suffering,
00:03:28 how events in the heavens
00:03:30 help us to understand the issue of universal sovereignty,
00:03:34 and how the outcome of Job’s trials
00:03:37 gives us a glimpse of future Kingdom blessings
00:03:40 for those who remain loyal to Jehovah.
