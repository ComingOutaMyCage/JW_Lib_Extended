00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:04.859 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to the book of Job.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:07.778 line:10% position:50% align:center
This book is grouped

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:09.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
with four other poetic books,

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:10.614 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it is among

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.575 line:10% position:50% align:center
the oldest books in the Bible.

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:16.537 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was completed by Moses

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:19.290 line:10% position:50% align:center
about 1473 B.C.E.,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.166 line:10% position:50% align:center
toward the end of the Israelites’

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.419 line:10% position:50% align:center
40-year trek in the wilderness.

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.839 line:10% position:50% align:center
The man Job lived in Uz.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.884 line:10% position:50% align:center
Shem, a forefather of Abraham,

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:33.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
was likely an ancestor of Job as well.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.639 line:10% position:50% align:center
Even though Job was not an Israelite,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
he was a worshipper of Jehovah.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job was very wealthy.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:47.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had many servants
and owned thousands of sheep,

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
camels, and other livestock.

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and his wife had ten children,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was highly respected in his community.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, all of this was lost

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a series of tragic events!

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the time Job’s trials took place,

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.838 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said that there

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.132 line:10% position:50% align:center
was ‘no one like Job on the earth.’

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we can place these events

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.597 line:10% position:50% align:center
after the death of the faithful man Joseph

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:20.017 line:10% position:50% align:center
but before Moses became leader over Israel.

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Job contains 42 chapters.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 1 and 2 reveal events
that took place in the heavens.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan challenged Jehovah

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and claimed that Job
would not remain faithful

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
when faced with adversity.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:42.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 3 to 31 contain
several rounds of debates

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Job and his three companions:

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eliphaz ridiculed Job’s integrity

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
and implied that man is useless to God.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bildad suggested that Job

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
was suffering as punishment for his sins.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zophar harshly insinuated

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Job was wicked.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job attempted to defend himself

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
from these accusations,

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in doing so,

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
he made incorrect statements about Jehovah.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 32 to 37,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
after listening to what Job

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his companions had to say,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
the young man Elihu offers wise counsel.

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in chapters 38 to 41, Jehovah,

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking out of a windstorm,
corrects Job’s thinking

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
with thought-provoking questions
about creation.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:45.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Job describes the earth

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:47.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
as suspended upon nothing,

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fact that was not widely recognized

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:51.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
until centuries later.

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the final chapter,

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
God commands Job’s three companions
to offer a sacrifice

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:02.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tells them
that Job will pray in their behalf.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah then restored
Job’s health and reputation,

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave him double the wealth he had before,

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:15.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
blessed him with seven more sons
and three more daughters,

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed him to live
for an additional 140 years.

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:22.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read this book,

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:25.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
pay attention to how this account proves

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is not the cause
of human suffering,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
how events in the heavens

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to understand
the issue of universal sovereignty,

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:37.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how the outcome of Job’s trials

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us a glimpse
of future Kingdom blessings

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those who remain loyal to Jehovah.
