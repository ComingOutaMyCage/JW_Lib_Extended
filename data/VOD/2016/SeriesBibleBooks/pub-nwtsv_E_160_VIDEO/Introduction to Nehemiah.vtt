00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:04.900 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to the book of Nehemiah.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah was a faithful Jewish man

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
who served
in the royal Persian court of Shushan.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had the high-ranking position
of cupbearer to King Artaxerxes.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:19.790 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sometime after 443 B.C.E.,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.208 line:10% position:50% align:center
the book of Nehemiah

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
was written in Jerusalem.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
It begins by describing events that happened

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.132 line:10% position:50% align:center
about 12 years after those in Ezra’s account.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.510 line:10% position:50% align:center
The book contains 13 chapters

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.763 line:10% position:50% align:center
that cover events that began in 456 B.C.E.

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.808 line:10% position:50% align:center
to sometime after 443 B.C.E.

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:40.352 line:10% position:50% align:center
However, the first 12 chapters

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:41.645 line:10% position:50% align:center
focus on what took place

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.522 line:10% position:50% align:center
just within the first year.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.734 line:10% position:50% align:center
The events in chapters 1 and 2

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:48.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
began to take place

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.613 line:10% position:50% align:center
near the end of 456 B.C.E.

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.740 line:10% position:50% align:center
Men from Jerusalem told Nehemiah

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.325 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the deplorable condition

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:56.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the city’s walls and gates.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.664 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah prayed to God for direction.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.666 line:10% position:50% align:center
In answer to Nehemiah’s prayer,

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.959 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Persian king

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:05.836 line:10% position:50% align:center
sent him to Jerusalem as governor

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:07.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
and granted him permission

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.715 line:10% position:50% align:center
to rebuild the walls.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:11.759 line:10% position:50% align:center
Upon arrival, Nehemiah

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
inspected the city walls.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.220 line:10% position:50% align:center
He then gathered the people

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.306 line:10% position:50% align:center
and announced his mission with the words:

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.”

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:22.811 line:10% position:50% align:center
The mission to rebuild Jerusalem

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:23.938 line:10% position:50% align:center
marked the beginning

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:25.481 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the 70 weeks of years

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Daniel’s prophecy.

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:31.320 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the end of 69 weeks of years,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.947 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Messiah would appear.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.741 line:10% position:50% align:center
Chapters 3 to 6

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:37.159 line:10% position:50% align:center
recount the rebuilding

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.702 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Jerusalem’s walls and gates

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:40.704 line:10% position:50% align:center
despite enemy opposition.

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
A large workforce of men and women

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:50.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
repaired Jerusalem’s walls in just 52 days!

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:56.053 line:10% position:50% align:center
Chapters 7 to 12 

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:57.805 line:10% position:50% align:center
show how Nehemiah and Ezra

00:01:57.805 --> 00:01:59.556 line:10% position:50% align:center
took the lead in helping the people

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.600 line:10% position:50% align:center
return to true worship.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.144 line:10% position:50% align:center
The people gathered to hear

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:06.689 line:10% position:50% align:center
the law being read and explained.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.315 line:10% position:50% align:center
Next, the eight-day

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
Festival of Booths was held.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.443 line:10% position:50% align:center
After this,

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.612 line:10% position:50% align:center
the walls of Jerusalem were inaugurated.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.240 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah continued

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.450 line:10% position:50% align:center
as governor of Jerusalem for 12 years

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.952 line:10% position:50% align:center
before returning to his duties

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:21.620 line:10% position:50% align:center
under King Artaxerxes.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.708 line:10% position:50% align:center
Chapter 13 tells us that Nehemiah

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.043 line:10% position:50% align:center
traveled to Jerusalem a second time,

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:29.670 line:10% position:50% align:center
only to find that the Jews

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 line:10% position:50% align:center
had not kept their promises to Jehovah.

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:35.592 line:10% position:50% align:center
He then took decisive action

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:37.177 line:10% position:50% align:center
to correct the situation.

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read this stirring account,

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Jehovah used
a Persian king to accomplish His will.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Observe how Nehemiah’s zeal for

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
and knowledge of God’s Law led to blessings,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note how the rebuilding
of Jerusalem’s walls

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
became a key to understanding
an important prophecy in Daniel

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
that pointed
to the appearance of the Messiah.
