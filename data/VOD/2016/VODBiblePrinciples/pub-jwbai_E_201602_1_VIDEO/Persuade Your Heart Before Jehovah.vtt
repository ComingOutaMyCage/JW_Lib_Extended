00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
My daughter will be giving her first talk

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:10.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Theocratic Ministry School tonight.

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a Christian father, I feel happy,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t know 
if I deserve to feel this way.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
I ran into some hard times spiritually
in the past.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received the help of the elders.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
They encouraged me,
telling me that I am precious

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s eyes and that I occupy

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
an important place among Jehovah’s people.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, still, I am plagued

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:41.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
by feelings of guilt and worthlessness.

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:44.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wish I could just let go

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:49.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
of such feelings and be a strong father
and husband for my family,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
but these discouraging thoughts continue

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:54.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
to drag me down.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mistakes were well in the past.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I accepted the discipline
and applied the counsel that was provided.

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:24.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have never fallen into the same course
of wrongdoing since then,

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:30.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my demanding heart
continues to condemn me.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:38.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love Jehovah very much,
and I am grateful for his mercy,

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I just don’t feel
that I am precious in his eyes anymore.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders continued
to show sincere interest in me.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their efforts really held me together

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.539 line:10% position:50% align:center
during those difficult times.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
They encouraged me to always remember

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the way Jehovah views us

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:21.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
is much more important
than the way we view ourselves.

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:25.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
They used an illustration
to convince me of this point.

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
A boy used to train hard
for a marathon at school.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to make his father proud.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the actual race,
he fell midway through.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:49.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
He thought his father
was no longer proud of him.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the father told his son:

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You fell once,
but you stood back up and finished the race.

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:01.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I know you trained hard,
and I see your potential.

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:04.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am confident that you will succeed.”

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:08.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told me that Jehovah sees us

00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way this father sees his son.

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if I stumble and fall,

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
He still sees me as His precious son.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders also read to me

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 John 3:19, 20:

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By this we will know
that we originate with the truth,

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we will assure our hearts before him

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“regarding whatever our hearts
may condemn us in,

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
because God is greater than our hearts
and knows all things.”

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pointed out that the verb here

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to assure’ can also mean ‘to persuade.’

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:53.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was encouraged that by studying
and meditating on the Scriptures

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I too could persuade
my stubborn heart before God.

00:03:58.788 --> 00:04:01.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
That night

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was once again overwhelmed by self-doubt.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reflecting on the account of King David

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to understand
how Jehovah really sees me.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our Creator,
he is well-aware of our weaknesses

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as our motives and our intentions.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on these things
helped me to regain my self-respect.

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also reflected on the example

00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
of King Jehoshaphat
in 2 Chronicles chapter 19.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophet Jehu reproved Jehoshaphat

00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:41.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
for allying himself with the wicked Ahab.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehu also 

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:48.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminded him 
that Jehovah saw good things in him.

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:56.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Jehu’s words and the writings
in the scrolls about Jehovah’s forgiveness,

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat was able to persuade

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:03.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
his self-condemning heart before Jehovah.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can see past my mistakes as well.

00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:17.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
He remembers my faithful service

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sees my true potential

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my sincere efforts to do his will.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading and meditating
on the Bible can change 

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:40.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
our view of the situation
we find ourselves in.

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:45.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I focus on the mercy

00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has shown me,
and I don’t allow my anxieties

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rob me of my strength.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:55.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like a heavy burden
has been lifted off my shoulders.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thank Jehovah for persuading

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:03.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
my heart to believe that I too

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:08.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
can draw close to him
as one of his precious sons.
