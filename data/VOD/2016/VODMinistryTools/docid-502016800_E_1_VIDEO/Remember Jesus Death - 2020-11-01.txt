00:00:01 Imagine a world filled with peace,
00:00:06 free of suffering,
00:00:10 an abundance of food for all,
00:00:13 and life in perfect health.
00:00:19 But how can this beautiful future be possible?
00:00:25 Because of what Jesus did for us.
00:00:29 He came to earth for a purpose.
00:00:34 He gave his life for those he loved.
00:00:40 The night before he died,
00:00:42 Jesus asked that we commemorate his sacrifice.
00:00:47 He said:
00:00:48 “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”
00:00:55 On the anniversary of his death,
00:00:57 people around the world will gather to remember him.
