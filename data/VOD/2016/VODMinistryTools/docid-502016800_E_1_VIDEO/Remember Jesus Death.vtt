The night before he died,

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus asked that we commemorate
his sacrifice.

He said:

00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
