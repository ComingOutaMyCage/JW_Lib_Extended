00:00:02 “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth,
00:00:07 “and you must read it in an undertone day and night,
00:00:11 “in order to observe carefully all that is written in it;
00:00:15 “for then your way will be successful
00:00:18 and then you will act wisely.”
00:00:23 The Bible is enjoyed in many different formats,
00:00:28 one of which is the audio edition of the New World Translation.
00:00:33 “The good news according to Matthew.”
00:00:36 But how is it produced?
00:00:38 Let’s take a closer look.
00:00:41 When we first heard that the Governing Body
00:00:44 wanted to record the revised edition of the New World Translation,
00:00:47 I think all of us knew that it was going to be a big job.
00:00:51 The narrator is one voice,
00:00:53 and all the other characters
00:00:58 are different voices.
00:01:00 It’s not a dramatic Bible reading,
00:01:02 but it’s a reading with a high level of realism.
00:01:06 There’s no music, no sound effects, just voices.
00:01:10 We were surprised to find out how many characters there were in the Bible.
00:01:13 The Bible is a really big book.
00:01:15 I don’t think any of us realized how big of a job it would be.
00:01:19 This is not a little project.
00:01:20 This is huge!
00:01:25 The research really is one of the items that is very fundamental, basic.
00:01:30 It is very important to get the facts together.
00:01:33 The Bible is true life;
00:01:35 it’s what really happened to real people.
00:01:38 We had to break down who the voices were.
00:01:42 And then we had to give each character a unique name to identify him.
00:01:46 If he’s not named in the Bible . . .
00:01:48 We have to just give them descriptions that are in the context,
00:01:51 like “Third Jew” or “First in the crowd.”
00:01:54 We were given a room
00:01:57 —a fair-sized room.
00:01:58 And we used it to make a list
00:02:01 of all of the characters in all four Gospels.
00:02:05 We began with the book of Matthew,
00:02:07 and we had to determine the parallel accounts
00:02:11 between the different Gospel writers.
00:02:13 You’ll have to use the same voice for a character.
00:02:16 If he appears in one book,
00:02:18 he needs to be the same voice in the other books.
00:02:20 Like in Matthew chapter 21,
00:02:23 we have this report
00:02:26 where Matthew simply says, well, the disciples say
00:02:28 that ‘the fig tree has withered.’
00:02:29 But who are the disciples?
00:02:31 Did they all say it at the same time?
00:02:33 So if you check in Mark, for example, Mark is very specific.
00:02:37 He says that Peter said: “The fig tree . . . has withered.”
00:02:41 The Art Department
00:02:42 took those maps and charts in the appendix
00:02:45 and blew them up into poster size for us
00:02:47 as we were deciding
00:02:49 who said what and where they were and how to name the characters.
00:02:52 It was very helpful to have that.
00:02:53 All that gets put into a database
00:02:55 —what kind of attributes they had— age, where they were from,
00:02:59 what kind of traits they were expressing in their quotations.
00:03:04 When the Bible talks about Jehovah speaking,
00:03:08 well, was it really Jehovah himself who spoke?
00:03:11 Well, something we know is
00:03:12 that at least on three occasions it was Jehovah who spoke.
00:03:16 This was when Jesus was on earth.
00:03:18 We compiled most of the research, and then it was forwarded on
00:03:22 to Writing Research.
00:03:23 We have a large library here in Bethel
00:03:27 that is focusing especially on Biblical subjects.
00:03:31 And we’re using this quite a bit
00:03:32 because we need to make sure that what we say is solid.
00:03:36 We are a people for Jehovah, and we are really—
00:03:40 Everything we say, it’s based on the Bible.
00:03:42 We don’t want to read too much into Bible accounts.
00:03:44 And we don’t want to read it in a way that steers incorrectly.
00:03:50 Because so many voices were needed for the project,
00:03:54 we realized that we wouldn’t be able to restrict ourselves
00:03:56 to using just readers at Patterson where our Audio/Video studios are.
00:04:00 So we really didn’t have a good place anymore in Brooklyn,
00:04:04 but we wanted some place close to the Governing Body.
00:04:06 Yeah, New York City is a very noisy place.
00:04:09 So we hunted all over the buildings.
00:04:12 We finally found, in the basement of the 25 Columbia Heights building,
00:04:15 a quiet place.
00:04:18 That’s where we are right now. We are in the underground.
00:04:23 To start with, who’s in Bethel?
00:04:25 We have an audition bank here in Audio/Video.
00:04:27 We poured through hundreds of auditions.
00:04:30 We had a brother from Africa that we auditioned over the Internet.
00:04:33 He’s sitting there reading into a mic;
00:04:36 I’m watching him.
00:04:37 By the time we tallied all of the characters for the entire Bible,
00:04:42 we realized we had about a thousand characters.
00:04:45 So a thousand voices that we’ll need to find.
00:04:50 There was a reading seminar
00:04:52 at which we were taught every aspect of reading.
00:04:56 And that was very effective because it reminded us of a lot of things:
00:05:01 dos and don’ts for effective reading.
00:05:03 It really gave me the confidence and understanding
00:05:05 that I think I can do this.
00:05:07 Some of the roles are very small.
00:05:09 Those short, very short passages
00:05:12 —those one-sentence lines
00:05:14 that we would call a person in for—
00:05:18 were some of the hardest to coach.
00:05:21 When I initially was asked to participate in the Bible reading,
00:05:26 I was so excited.
00:05:27 And then I saw that it was one line, and I thought:
00:05:29 ‘OK, well, it won’t be too bad. It will be easy.’
00:05:32 And then, so I listened to the Bible reading seminar,
00:05:36 and it really helped me to take it more seriously.
00:05:39 We would even ask the readers to study this over.
00:05:43 You only have one sentence, but study all about this character.
00:05:47 I read the chapter. I read the Insight book.
00:05:50 And I realized that this is more than just
00:05:55 saying one line.
00:05:56 What we have found is that it’s a good idea
00:05:59 to provide the reader with a script that has been customized.
00:06:03 Have the word written out phonetically
00:06:05 so that you would know better how to pronounce it.
00:06:07 I would say, “Sulomon.”
00:06:08 Sulomon? Who’s he?
00:06:10 It’s that kind of thing.
00:06:11 So anyway, they helped you pronounce “Solomon.”
00:06:14 And they were very careful to make sure the pronunciation was accurate.
00:06:18 And that it would be consistent and accurate
00:06:21 all the way through the Bible reading from beginning to end.
00:06:27 Every morning we prepare the studio for recording.
00:06:30 We’ll go in, turn on the lights, turn on all the equipment,
00:06:33 make sure that we have water —hot and cold—for the reader.
00:06:36 One of the things we learned in the seminar
00:06:38 was the importance of staying hydrated.
00:06:40 Sometimes we can use vinegar or honey.
00:06:43 A little bit of lemon.
00:06:44 So when the character comes in, we try to help them to kind of think about the context.
00:06:48 Of course, they have already done that in their own research and practice
00:06:51 but a little bit more about, maybe, the motive of the character.
00:06:54 How would they have felt
00:06:55 in this particular instance?
00:06:57 How would they say this line?
00:06:58 But we also want to make sure the brothers and sisters
00:07:00 feel really comfortable,
00:07:02 and it often takes a long time
00:07:05 to get them to relax.
00:07:07 In the control room, there are basically
00:07:10 three roles and the reader.
00:07:13 The follower is responsible
00:07:14 to make sure that all of the content is there —to make sure that no words are missing.
00:07:19 During the recording, the audio engineer
00:07:21 is listening for anything that will distract the listeners:
00:07:25 stomach noises or shirt noise or if the brother is wearing suspenders.
00:07:29 The coach is responsible for the quality of teaching.
00:07:32 I love watching the coach try to get the right emotion out of the reader.
00:07:36 So then, you might read a line,
00:07:37 and he’ll say, “Can you say that again with a smile?”
00:07:40 And it’s amazing because then it sounds more joyful.
00:07:43 And then once you capture the emotion,
00:07:45 then it naturally comes out.
00:07:46 You’re not trying to copy what he’s told you to say.
00:07:49 What we usually have a person do
00:07:51 is start with one emotion —that you’re sad—
00:07:54 and then add each emotion on top.
00:07:57 That ends up getting a very complex delivery of a line.
00:08:02 There are so many possible ways to say one line,
00:08:04 and I didn’t even realize how many.
00:08:06 You think you know how the character said it,
00:08:11 and then the coach will give you a suggestion.
00:08:14 The Bible, of course, is filled with all different kinds of personalities.
00:08:18 And the Bible is full of bad characters.
00:08:21 When I got my assignment and found out what I was supposed to read,
00:08:26 I really stopped
00:08:28 because at Bethel and with everybody else
00:08:30 we’re supposed to be encouraging to other people,
00:08:33 and here is a fella
00:08:36 who is talking disrespectfully to Jehovah.
00:08:40 And I had to stop and think.
00:08:44 These brothers were all mature Christian men.
00:08:47 They had their personalities refined for years and years, this new personality.
00:08:51 To make those expressions the way they were
00:08:55 by these contrary critters,
00:08:57 you had to think and put your heart into it.
00:09:00 And sometimes when I pushed it a little too much,
00:09:02 they would say: “Come on, cool it a little bit, will you?
00:09:05 That’s not exactly what we want.”
00:09:07 But I tried to be the bad guy when I was supposed to be.
00:09:18 So the editing process actually begins during the recording.
00:09:21 And then when we get done recording,
00:09:23 perhaps a chapter,
00:09:24 we’ll take down the best takes of every verse
00:09:28 because the reader and the coach can then listen back and see,
00:09:30 “OK, do we like how it sounds?”
00:09:32 We use professional software to do the editing
00:09:34 —and that means we do all the spacing that’s needed,
00:09:37 we pull in all the characters for a specific chapter.
00:09:39 Because we record each voice individually,
00:09:41 it’s not a group of people around the microphone
00:09:44 having the conversation, so each character is done.
00:09:47 And then if there are multiple voices  in a chapter, then we pull them all together.
00:09:52 Once we started editing these chapters together,
00:09:56 a beautiful artwork of truth as you’re seeing the context jump out,
00:10:02 and for us to then feel it
00:10:04 and move us as the reader of God’s Word,
00:10:08 hearer of God’s Word.
00:10:12 The comment I’ve heard over and over again is,
00:10:17 “It’s brought the Bible to life in my mind and heart.”
00:10:22 And it has encouraged us
00:10:25 to meditate deeper into God’s Word.
00:10:29 Having the different characters read the voices
00:10:32 is going to be such a comfort to all of us.
00:10:36 I think that this is really going to make Bible reading exciting.
00:10:40 So now the Bible is alive, and what a difference it makes!
00:10:45 I think they’re going to love it!
