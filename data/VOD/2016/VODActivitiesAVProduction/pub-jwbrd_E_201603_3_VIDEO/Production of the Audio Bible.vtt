“This book of the Law
should not depart from your mouth,

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must read it
in an undertone day and night,

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to observe carefully
all that is written in it;

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:18.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for then your way will be successful

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:21.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you will act wisely.”

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is enjoyed
in many different formats,

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:33.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of which is the audio edition
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The good news according to Matthew.”

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is it produced?

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a closer look.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we first heard
that the Governing Body

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanted to record the revised edition
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think all of us knew
that it was going to be a big job.

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
The narrator is one voice,

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the other characters

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
are different voices.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a dramatic Bible reading,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s a reading
with a high level of realism.

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:10.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no music,
no sound effects, just voices.

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were surprised to find out
how many characters there were in the Bible.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is a really big book.

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:19.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think any of us realized
how big of a job it would be.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not a little project.

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is huge!

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:30.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
The research really is one of the items
that is very fundamental, basic.

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:33.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is very important
to get the facts together.

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:35.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is true life;

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:38.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s what really happened to real people.

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to break down who the voices were.

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:46.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we had to give each character
a unique name to identify him.

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he’s not named in the Bible . . .

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to just give them descriptions
that are in the context,

00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “Third Jew” or “First in the crowd.”

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were given a room

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a fair-sized room.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we used it to make a list

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:05.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all of the characters in all four Gospels.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began with the book of Matthew,

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:11.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had to determine the parallel accounts

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the different Gospel writers.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:16.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have to use
the same voice for a character.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he appears in one book,

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
he needs to be the same voice
in the other books.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like in Matthew chapter 21,

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have this report

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:28.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Matthew simply says,
well, the disciples say

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘the fig tree has withered.’

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who are the disciples?

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they all say it at the same time?

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:37.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you check in Mark,
for example, Mark is very specific.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says that Peter said:
“The fig tree . . . has withered.”

00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Art Department

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
took those maps and charts in the appendix

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blew them up into poster size for us

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we were deciding

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
who said what and where they were
and how to name the characters.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:53.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very helpful to have that.

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
All that gets put into a database

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what kind of attributes they had—
age, where they were from,

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:04.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of traits
they were expressing in their quotations.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Bible talks about Jehovah speaking,

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, was it really Jehovah himself
who spoke?

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:12.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, something we know is

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at least on three occasions
it was Jehovah who spoke.

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was when Jesus was on earth.

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:22.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
We compiled most of the research,
and then it was forwarded on

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Writing Research.

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a large library here in Bethel

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:31.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is focusing
especially on Biblical subjects.

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re using this quite a bit

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we need to make sure
that what we say is solid.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:40.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are a people for Jehovah,
and we are really—

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:42.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything we say, it’s based on the Bible.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to read
too much into Bible accounts.

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:48.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t want to read it
in a way that steers incorrectly.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because so many voices
were needed for the project,

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:56.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realized that we
wouldn’t be able to restrict ourselves

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
to using just readers at Patterson
where our Audio/Video studios are.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we really didn’t have
a good place anymore in Brooklyn,

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:06.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we wanted some place
close to the Governing Body.

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, New York City is a very noisy place.

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:12.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we hunted all over the buildings.

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:15.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
We finally found, in the basement
of the 25 Columbia Heights building,

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:17.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
a quiet place.

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:20.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where we are right now.
We are in the underground.

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:25.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
To start with, who’s in Bethel?

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have an audition bank
here in Audio/Video.

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:30.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
We poured through hundreds of auditions.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a brother from Africa
that we auditioned over the Internet.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s sitting there reading into a mic;

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m watching him.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time we tallied
all of the characters for the entire Bible,

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:45.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realized we had
about a thousand characters.

00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:48.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a thousand voices that we’ll need to find.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a reading seminar

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
at which we were taught
every aspect of reading.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was very effective
because it reminded us of a lot of things:

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
dos and don’ts for effective reading.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really gave me
the confidence and understanding

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I think I can do this.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the roles are very small.

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those short, very short passages

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:14.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those one-sentence lines

00:05:14.797 --> 00:05:18.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would call a person in for—

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
were some of the hardest to coach.

00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I initially was asked
to participate in the Bible reading,

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:27.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so excited.

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:29.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I saw that it was one line,
and I thought:

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘OK, well, it won’t be too bad.
It will be easy.’

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, so I listened
to the Bible reading seminar,

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it really helped me
to take it more seriously.

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:43.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would even ask the readers
to study this over.

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:47.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
You only have one sentence,
but study all about this character.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read the chapter.
I read the <i>Insight</i> book.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized
that this is more than just

00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:56.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying one line.

00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:59.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we have found is that it’s a good idea

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide the reader
with a script that has been customized.

00:06:03.146 --> 00:06:05.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have the word written out phonetically

00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:07.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you would know better
how to pronounce it.

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:08.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say, “Sulomon.”

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:10.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sulomon?
Who’s he?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s that kind of thing.

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:14.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
So anyway, they helped you
pronounce “Solomon.”

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:18.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were very careful to make sure
the pronunciation was accurate.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:21.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that it would be consistent and accurate

00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the way through the Bible reading
from beginning to end.

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:30.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every morning
we prepare the studio for recording.

00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll go in, turn on the lights,
turn on all the equipment,

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:36.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
make sure that we have water
—hot and cold—for the reader.

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the things we learned in the seminar

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the importance of staying hydrated.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we can use vinegar or honey.

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:44.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little bit of lemon.

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:48.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the character comes in, we try to
help them to kind of think about the context.

00:06:48.524 --> 00:06:51.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, they have already done that
in their own research and practice

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a little bit more about, maybe,
the motive of the character.

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they have felt

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:57.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this particular instance?

00:06:57.266 --> 00:06:58.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they say this line?

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:00.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also want to make sure
the brothers and sisters

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel really comfortable,

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it often takes a long time

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get them to relax.

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:10.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the control room, there are basically

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
three roles and the reader.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
The follower is responsible

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that all of the content is there
—to make sure that no words are missing.

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the recording,
the audio engineer

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
is listening for anything
that will distract the listeners:

00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:29.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
stomach noises or shirt noise
or if the brother is wearing suspenders.

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
The coach is responsible
for the quality of teaching.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love watching the coach try to get
the right emotion out of the reader.

00:07:36.472 --> 00:07:37.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then, you might read a line,

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll say,
“Can you say that again with a smile?”

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s amazing
because then it sounds more joyful.

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then once you capture the emotion,

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:46.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it naturally comes out.

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not trying to copy
what he’s told you to say.

00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:51.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we usually have a person do

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
is start with one emotion
—that you’re sad—

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then add each emotion on top.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
That ends up getting
a very complex delivery of a line.

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:04.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many possible ways
to say one line,

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t even realize how many.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think you know how the character said it,

00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:14.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the coach
will give you a suggestion.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible, of course, is filled
with all different kinds of personalities.

00:08:18.214 --> 00:08:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Bible is full of bad characters.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I got my assignment
and found out what I was supposed to read,

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really stopped

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at Bethel
and with everybody else

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re supposed to be encouraging
to other people,

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here is a fella

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is talking disrespectfully to Jehovah.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I had to stop and think.

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:47.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
These brothers were all mature Christian men.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had their personalities refined
for years and years, this new personality.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
To make those expressions
the way they were

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
by these contrary critters,

00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:00.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
you had to think and put your heart into it.

00:09:00.423 --> 00:09:02.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes
when I pushed it a little too much,

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:05.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would say:
“Come on, cool it a little bit, will you?

00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:07.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not exactly what we want.”

00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:13.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I tried to be the bad guy
when I was supposed to be.

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:21.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the editing process
actually begins during the recording.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when we
get done recording,

00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:24.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps a chapter,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll take down the best takes of every verse

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the reader and the coach
can then listen back and see,

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:32.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“OK, do we like how it sounds?”

00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
We use professional software
to do the editing

00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:37.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and that means
we do all the spacing that’s needed,

00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:39.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
we pull in all the characters
for a specific chapter.

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:41.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we record each voice individually,

00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:44.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not a group of people
around the microphone

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:47.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
having the conversation,
so each character is done.

00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:52.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then if there are multiple voices 
in a chapter, then we pull them all together.

00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:56.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once we started editing
these chapters together,

00:09:56.912 --> 00:10:02.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful artwork of truth
as you’re seeing the context jump out,

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for us to then feel it

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move us as the reader of God’s Word,

00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:10.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
hearer of God’s Word.

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:16.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
The comment I’ve heard
over and over again is,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s brought the Bible to life
in my mind and heart.”

00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:25.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it has encouraged us

00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meditate deeper into God’s Word.

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:32.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having the different characters
read the voices

00:10:32.948 --> 00:10:36.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be such a comfort to all of us.

00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:40.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that this is really going to make
Bible reading exciting.

00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now the Bible is alive,
and what a difference it makes!

00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:46.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think they’re going to love it!
