00:00:13 In the whole of humankind, Be sure you’ll never find
00:00:20 Someone who can say, “I’ve never stumbled in my life.”
00:00:26 And now this time it’s you, But there’s something you can do:
00:00:32 Learn from the experience, And take the help our loving God provides.
00:00:41 Get back up when you’re down. You can turn this around.
00:00:48 Get back up; stand up tall. You can learn from a fall.
00:00:54 Just reach out; take his hand.
00:00:57 He’ll raise you up— make you stand.
00:01:01 And one thing that’s for sure: You’ll be stronger than before
00:01:09 If you learn from a fall.
00:01:24 Another dawn is breaking, And your heart may be aching.
00:01:30 But you can’t go back in time. You have to see it through.
00:01:36 Stop and think it over, And take it to Jehovah.
00:01:43 His Word is there to guide you, To pick you up and show you what to do.
00:01:52 Get back up when you’re down. You can turn this around.
00:01:58 Get back up; stand up tall. You can learn from a fall.
00:02:05 Just reach out; take his hand.
00:02:08 He’ll raise you up— make you stand.
00:02:11 And one thing that’s for sure: You’ll be stronger than before.
00:02:19 Let Jehovah’s Word remind you You can put it all behind you.
00:02:26 His love “is greater than our hearts,” You may recall.
00:02:31 Learn from a fall.
00:03:04 Get back up when you’re down. You can turn this around.
00:03:10 Get back up; stand up tall. You can learn from a fall.
00:03:17 Just reach out; take his hand.
00:03:20 He’ll raise you up— make you stand.
00:03:23 And one thing that’s for sure: You’ll be stronger than before
00:03:31 If you learn from a fall.
00:03:45 You can learn from a fall.
