When we were woven
in the depths of the earth,

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:21.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we even came
into this world,

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:29.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw
right from the start

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep down
inside our beating heart.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just stop and think
what that means.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:48.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:08.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:12.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a father
wants his child to succeed,

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how he feels
about you and me.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sifts through us
and sees where we shine

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who we can be
in Paradise.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:50.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
So always know
that he cares.

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:04.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows.

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:34.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must look up above
and never forget about his love and pray—

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pray.

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:45.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell him when life is hard
and fear’s got a grip on our heart.

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, we’re okay;
we don’t have to be afraid.

00:02:53.402 --> 00:03:00.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:07.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:20.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows.
