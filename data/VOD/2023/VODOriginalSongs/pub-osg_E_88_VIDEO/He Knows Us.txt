00:00:08 When we were woven in the depths of the earth,
00:00:14 Before we even came into this world,
00:00:22 Jehovah saw right from the start
00:00:29 Deep down inside our beating heart.
00:00:36 Just stop and think what that means.
00:00:41 He knows you; he knows me— What we feel, what we see,
00:00:48 When we try hard to give our best, The joys we feel, and our regrets.
00:00:55 He knows you; he knows me— What we need, what we plead.
00:01:02 When we can’t find the words to say, we’re not alone.
00:01:08 He knows.
00:01:17 Like a father wants his child to succeed,
00:01:24 That’s how he feels about you and me.
00:01:31 He sifts through us and sees where we shine
00:01:37 And who we can be in Paradise.
00:01:44 So always know that he cares.
00:01:50 He knows you; he knows me— What we feel, what we see,
00:01:57 When we try hard to give our best, The joys we feel, and our regrets.
00:02:04 He knows you; he knows me— What we need, what we plead.
00:02:11 When we can’t find the words to say, we’re not alone.
00:02:17 He knows.
00:02:25 So we must look up above and never forget about his love and pray—
00:02:34 and pray.
00:02:38 Tell him when life is hard and fear’s got a grip on our heart.
00:02:45 Remember, we’re okay; we don’t have to be afraid.
00:02:53 He knows you; he knows me— What we feel, what we see,
00:03:00 When we try hard to give our best, The joys we feel, and our regrets.
00:03:07 He knows you; he knows me— What we need, what we plead.
00:03:14 When we can’t find the words to say, we’re not alone.
00:03:20 He knows you; he knows me— What we feel, what we see,
00:03:28 When we try hard to give our best, The joys we feel, and our regrets.
00:03:34 He knows you; he knows me— What we need, what we plead.
00:03:41 When we can’t find the words to say, we’re not alone.
00:03:48 He knows.
