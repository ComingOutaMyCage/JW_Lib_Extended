00:00:13 Two small coins Are all that she can give.
00:00:25 As she waits, The courtyard echoes with bountiful gifts.
00:00:36 Lost in the crowd, Like a single grain of sand,
00:00:46 Will her Father take note Of the two small coins in her hand?
00:01:01 No matter how small, Don’t wonder at all,
00:01:08 ‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’
00:01:12 It’s not hard to believe If we see how he sees—
00:01:19 If we see through Jehovah’s eyes—
00:01:26 Two small coins.
00:01:35 Would she have thought Of all she’d given before—
00:01:46 Of easier times When she had the means to give so much more?
00:01:58 She drops in her coins, Unheard by others around.
00:02:08 But for Jehovah God, This small gift made a thunderous sound.
00:02:23 No matter how small, Don’t wonder at all,
00:02:30 ‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’
00:02:35 It’s not hard to believe If we see how he sees—
00:02:42 If we see through Jehovah’s eyes—
00:02:49 Two small coins.
00:02:52 He looks far beyond what you and I see.
00:02:58 He knows who we really are underneath.
00:03:05 He sees all we can be.
00:03:13 No matter how small, Don’t wonder at all,
00:03:20 ‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’
00:03:24 It’s not hard to believe If we see how he sees—
00:03:31 If we see through Jehovah’s eyes—
00:03:39 Two small coins.
00:03:48 Do you see through Jehovah’s eyes?
