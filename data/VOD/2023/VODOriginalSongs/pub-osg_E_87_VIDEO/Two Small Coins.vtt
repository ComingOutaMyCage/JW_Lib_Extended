00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:23.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins
Are all that she can give.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:35.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she waits,
The courtyard echoes with bountiful gifts.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lost in the crowd,
Like a single grain of sand,

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will her Father take note
Of the two small coins in her hand?

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how small,
Don’t wonder at all,

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:12.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to believe
If we see how he sees—

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:26.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see
through Jehovah’s eyes—

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she have thought
Of all she’d given before—

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of easier times
When she had the means to give so much more?

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
She drops in her coins,
Unheard by others around.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for Jehovah God,
This small gift made a thunderous sound.

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how small,
Don’t wonder at all,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:42.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to believe
If we see how he sees—

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see
through Jehovah’s eyes—

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:58.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looks far beyond
what you and I see.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows
who we really are underneath.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees
all we can be.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how small,
Don’t wonder at all,

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he notice my sacrifice?’

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:31.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to believe
If we see how he sees—

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:39.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see
through Jehovah’s eyes—

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:43.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two small coins.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:55.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see
through Jehovah’s eyes?
