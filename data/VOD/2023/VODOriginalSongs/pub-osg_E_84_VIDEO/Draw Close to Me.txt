00:00:08 Feels like I’ve come home. I was lost until Jehovah took me in.
00:00:24 Once, I faced my fears alone. Now I share them all, all with him.
00:00:39 And he brings comfort to my life, Makes me feel that I belong.
00:00:55 He says: “Draw close to me, close to me, And I’ll draw close to you.
00:01:11 “I’ll help you see, help you see, The good that I see in you
00:01:25 If you draw close to me.”
00:01:42 When I’m feeling low And my heart begins to condemn me for my past,
00:01:58 Feels so hard to let it go. So I pray to God it won’t last.
00:02:13 And just to know Jehovah cares Lifts me up and gives me hope.
00:02:26 He says: “Draw close to me, close to me, And I’ll draw close to you.
00:02:41 “I’ll help you see, help you see, The good that I see in you
00:02:57 If you draw close to me.”
00:03:10 Before I ever knew his name, He saw the best in me.
00:03:25 And now he’s just a prayer away, My God eternally.
00:03:43 He says: “Draw close to me, close to me, And I’ll draw close to you.
00:03:58 “I’ll help you see, help you see, The good that I see in you
00:04:13 If you draw close to me.”
