Feels like I’ve come home.
I was lost until Jehovah took me in.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once, I faced my fears alone.
Now I share them all, all with him.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he brings comfort to my life,
Makes me feel that I belong.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Draw close to me, close to me,
And I’ll draw close to you.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll help you see, help you see,
The good that I see in you

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you draw close to me.”

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m feeling low
And my heart begins to condemn me for my past,

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:10.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feels so hard to let it go.
So I pray to God it won’t last.

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:25.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just to know Jehovah cares
Lifts me up and gives me hope.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Draw close to me, close to me,
And I’ll draw close to you.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:57.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll help you see, help you see,
The good that I see in you

00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you draw close to me.”

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:23.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I ever knew his name,
He saw the best in me.

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:42.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now he’s just a prayer away,
My God eternally.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:57.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Draw close to me, close to me,
And I’ll draw close to you.

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll help you see, help you see,
The good that I see in you

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:24.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you draw close to me.”
