00:00:08 In this world, it can be hard— Not just to follow your heart—
00:00:16 To be diff’rent and do what’s right.
00:00:24 But Jehovah tells us in his Word: ‘Don’t be molded by this world.’
00:00:33 He promises life in Paradise.
00:00:39 So stand tall; give your all.
00:00:48 Jehovah’s right there with you; he won’t let you fall.
00:00:55 And pray ev’ry day
00:01:03 To climb those mountains out there standing in your way.
00:01:10 Oh, don’t live for today; live for forever.
00:01:27 They will try and offer fame— Put a spotlight on your name,
00:01:34 Raise you up for all to see.
00:01:43 But rather than strive after wind, Jehovah says reach out to him.
00:01:51 He promises life in Paradise.
00:01:58 So stand tall; give your all.
00:02:06 Jehovah’s right there with you; he won’t let you fall.
00:02:14 And pray ev’ry day
00:02:21 To climb those mountains out there standing in your way.
00:02:29 Oh, don’t live for today; live for forever.
00:02:53 So stand tall; give your all.
00:03:02 Jehovah’s right there with you; he won’t let you fall.
00:03:09 And pray ev’ry day
00:03:17 To climb those mountains out there standing in your way.
00:03:24 Oh, don’t live for today; live for forever.
