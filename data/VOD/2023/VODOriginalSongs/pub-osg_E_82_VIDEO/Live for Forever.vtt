In this world, it can be hard—
Not just to follow your heart—

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be diff’rent
and do what’s right.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah tells us in his Word:
‘Don’t be molded by this world.’

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promises life
in Paradise.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stand tall;
give your all.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s right there with you;
he won’t let you fall.

00:00:55.743 --> 00:01:03.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray
ev’ry day

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
To climb those mountains out there
standing in your way.

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:22.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, don’t live for today;
live for forever.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will try and offer fame—
Put a spotlight on your name,

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Raise you up
for all to see.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather than strive after wind,
Jehovah says reach out to him.

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promises life
in Paradise.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stand tall;
give your all.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:14.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s right there with you;
he won’t let you fall.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:21.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray
ev’ry day

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
To climb those mountains out there
standing in your way.

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, don’t live for today;
live for forever.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stand tall;
give your all.

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s right there with you;
he won’t let you fall.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray
ev’ry day

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
To climb those mountains out there
standing in your way.

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:36.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, don’t live for today;
live for forever.
