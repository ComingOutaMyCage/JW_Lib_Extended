00:00:01 Have you ever heard someone say:
00:00:03 “I’m not religious, but I am spiritual”
00:00:07 or “I don’t need to belong to a religion;
00:00:10 I worship God in my own way”?
00:00:14 Many people believe that they don’t need to be associated
00:00:17 with a specific religious organization
00:00:20 —that it’s good enough simply to have
00:00:22 a personal relationship with God.
00:00:25 It’s not surprising that they feel that way.
00:00:28 Many religious organizations have promoted false worship.
00:00:33 They’ve mistreated their followers
00:00:35 or demanded large sums of money from them
00:00:38 and tolerated or even promoted conduct
00:00:41 that the Bible condemns.
00:00:44 Of course, it’s the fruitage of those organizations that’s bad,
00:00:49 not the fact that they are organized.
00:00:52 But we might still ask,
00:00:54 ‘Does Jehovah want his people to be organized?’
00:00:59 What does his Word say?
00:01:01 The Bible reveals that the early Christians were organized.
00:01:06 Consider what’s recorded in Acts chapter 15.
00:01:10 An issue arose
00:01:12 —an issue involving doctrine, or belief,
00:01:15 that caused disagreement among those in the congregation.
00:01:19 How would they settle that issue?
00:01:22 Did they conclude that it was enough
00:01:24 for each Christian to have his own relationship with God
00:01:27 and for each person to believe what he personally wanted?
00:01:30 No.
00:01:32 That would have divided the young Christian congregation,
00:01:36 which at this point was less than 20 years old.
00:01:39 At Acts 15:2, we read:
00:01:42 “But after quite a bit of dissension
00:01:45 “and disputing by Paul and Barnabas with them,
00:01:48 “it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas,
00:01:50 “and some of the others to go up to the apostles
00:01:53 and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.”
00:01:56 The apostles and elders in Jerusalem
00:01:59 made a decision that resolved the issue.
00:02:03 Thereafter, they made their decision known to the congregations.
00:02:07 This helped to restore peace and unity.
00:02:11 That wasn’t an exceptional case.
00:02:14 Sometime later, the apostle Paul and Timothy visited the congregations.
00:02:19 What did they accomplish?
00:02:21 Acts 16:4 says:
00:02:24 “As they traveled on through the cities,
00:02:27 “they would deliver to them for observance
00:02:29 “the decrees that had been decided on
00:02:31 by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.”
00:02:36 The apostles and elders in Jerusalem
00:02:38 consistently provided spiritual food, direction,
00:02:43 and practical help for God’s people in the first century.
00:02:47 They acted as a governing body.
00:02:50 What was the result of such organization?
00:02:54 Note the next verse.
00:02:56 It says: “Then, indeed,
00:02:59 “the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith
00:03:03 and to increase in number day by day.”
00:03:07 That organization in the first century helped the early Christians to be united,
00:03:12 productive, and happy.
00:03:15 In like manner, Jehovah’s people today are organized.
00:03:20 This reflects Jehovah’s personality.
00:03:23 First Corinthians chapter 14,
00:03:26 verses 33 and 40 says in part:
00:03:30 “God is a God not of disorder
00:03:34 “but of peace. . . .
00:03:36 Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.”
00:03:42 Think about it: Organization really helps us
00:03:45 to fulfill Jehovah’s requirements for true worship.
00:03:48 Consider five examples.
00:03:51 First, we must be organized to meet together for worship.
00:03:56 How could we do so if we didn’t know one another,
00:04:00 didn’t have designated places and times to gather together,
00:04:04 and didn’t have a scheduled program for each meeting?
00:04:08 Second, we must be organized to be united in belief.
00:04:13 All of us receive the same instruction at congregation meetings,
00:04:17 assemblies, and conventions,
00:04:20 and we’re helped to understand the Scriptures
00:04:23 through Bible-based publications and videos.
00:04:27 These provisions require organization,
00:04:30 and they help us to worship unitedly and,
00:04:33 as 1 Corinthians 1:10 counsels us,
00:04:36 to “speak in agreement.”
00:04:41 Third, we must be organized
00:04:43 to form a worldwide brotherhood.
00:04:47 First Peter 2:17 reminds us
00:04:50 that we belong to an “association of brothers.”
00:04:54 If we weren’t organized,
00:04:56 how could we even identify those
00:04:59 who are truly part of our spiritual family?
00:05:02 Fourth, we must be organized to preach the good news
00:05:06 to people of different nations, tribes, and languages.
00:05:10 How could we possibly declare the Kingdom message
00:05:13 thoroughly and effectively
00:05:15 if we weren’t associated with an organization?
00:05:19 Fifth, we must be organized to provide disaster relief.
00:05:25 Just as the early Christians had an arrangement to supply financial aid
00:05:30 to their needy brothers and sisters in other lands,
00:05:32 so we are organized to help our brothers and sisters
00:05:36 as soon as possible after a disaster,
00:05:39 disease outbreak, or other emergency.
00:05:44 As was the case in the first century,
00:05:46 the Governing Body today provides spiritual food, direction,
00:05:50 and practical help for God’s people around the world.
00:05:54 Jesus has appointed that Governing Body to be “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:06:01 How grateful we are that Jehovah, through our Leader, Jesus Christ,
00:06:05 has organized us so that we can do God’s will
00:06:09 as a united brotherhood!
