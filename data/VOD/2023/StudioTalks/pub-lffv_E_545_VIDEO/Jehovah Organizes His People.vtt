Have you ever heard someone say:

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:07.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
“I’m not religious, but I am spiritual”

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.739 line:10% position:50% align:center
or “I don’t need to belong to a religion;

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worship God in my own way”?

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:17.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people believe
that they don’t need to be associated

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a specific religious organization

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that it’s good enough simply to have

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
a personal relationship with God.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not surprising that they feel that way.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many religious organizations
have promoted false worship.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve mistreated their followers

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
or demanded large sums of money from them

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tolerated or even promoted conduct

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible condemns.

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:49.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, it’s the fruitage
of those organizations that’s bad,

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
not the fact that they are organized.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we might still ask,

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:59.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does Jehovah want his people
to be organized?’

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does his Word say?

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:06.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible reveals
that the early Christians were organized.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider what’s recorded in Acts chapter 15.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
An issue arose

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an issue involving doctrine, or belief,

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
that caused disagreement
among those in the congregation.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they settle that issue?

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they conclude that it was enough

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each Christian
to have his own relationship with God

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for each person
to believe what he personally wanted?

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would have divided
the young Christian congregation,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:39.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
which at this point
was less than 20 years old.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 15:2, we read:

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:45.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But after quite a bit of dissension

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and disputing by Paul
and Barnabas with them,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, 

00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:53.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and some of the others
to go up to the apostles

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
and elders in Jerusalem
regarding this issue.”

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles and elders in Jerusalem

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
made a decision that resolved the issue.

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thereafter, they made their decision known
to the congregations.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helped to restore peace and unity.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
That wasn’t an exceptional case.

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:19.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, the apostle Paul and Timothy
visited the congregations.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did they accomplish?

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 16:4 says:

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they traveled on through the cities,

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they would deliver to them for observance

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the decrees that had been decided on

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the apostles and the elders
who were in Jerusalem.”

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles and elders in Jerusalem

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:43.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
consistently provided
spiritual food, direction,

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and practical help for God’s people
in the first century.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
They acted as a governing body.

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result of such organization?

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the next verse.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Then, indeed,

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:03.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the congregations
continued to be made firm in the faith

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to increase in number day by day.”

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
That organization in the first century
helped the early Christians to be united,

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
productive, and happy.

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:20.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
In like manner,
Jehovah’s people today are organized.

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:23.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reflects Jehovah’s personality.

00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:26.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians chapter 14,

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 33 and 40 says in part:

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:34.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is a God not of disorder

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but of peace. . . .

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let all things take place
decently and by arrangement.”

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it:
Organization really helps us

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:48.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fulfill Jehovah’s requirements
for true worship.

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:51.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider five examples.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we must be organized
to meet together for worship.

00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could we do so
if we didn’t know one another,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t have designated places
and times to gather together,

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
and didn’t have
a scheduled program for each meeting?

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we must be organized
to be united in belief.

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:17.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us receive the same instruction
at congregation meetings,

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
assemblies, and conventions,

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re helped to understand the Scriptures

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Bible-based publications and videos.

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
These provisions require organization,

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:33.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they help us to worship unitedly and,

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:36.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
as 1 Corinthians 1:10 counsels us,

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:39.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “speak in agreement.”

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we must be organized

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:46.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
to form a worldwide brotherhood.

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:17 reminds us

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we belong
to an “association of brothers.”

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we weren’t organized,

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:59.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
how could we even identify those

00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:01.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are truly part of our spiritual family?

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fourth, we must be organized
to preach the good news

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:10.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
to people of different nations,
tribes, and languages.

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could we possibly
declare the Kingdom message

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
thoroughly and effectively

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:18.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we weren’t associated
with an organization?

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:24.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fifth, we must be organized
to provide disaster relief.

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:30.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as the early Christians
had an arrangement to supply financial aid

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their needy brothers and sisters
in other lands,

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:36.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we are organized
to help our brothers and sisters

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:39.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
as soon as possible after a disaster,

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:42.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
disease outbreak, or other emergency.

00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:46.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
As was the case in the first century,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body today
provides spiritual food, direction,

00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
and practical help
for God’s people around the world.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:59.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus has appointed that Governing Body
to be “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:05.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
How grateful we are that Jehovah,
through our Leader, Jesus Christ,

00:06:05.594 --> 00:06:09.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
has organized us so that we can do God’s will

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:11.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a united brotherhood!
