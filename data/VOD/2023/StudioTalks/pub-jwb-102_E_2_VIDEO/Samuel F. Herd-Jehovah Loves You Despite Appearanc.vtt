00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:04.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month,
I’d like to talk to you on the subject

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah Loves You
Despite Appearances or Imperfections.”

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
You’ll likely notice

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
there are two areas we’ll discuss:

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.498 line:10% position:50% align:center
our appearance and our imperfections.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why address these two aspects?

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because there’s a percentage
of Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:32.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wonder if Jehovah can really love them

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of one of those two reasons

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
or both.

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take appearances first.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:43.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’ve gotten all cleaned up

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are fully dressed each day

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:49.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you glance in a full-length mirror,

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
are you pleased with the way you look?

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to change a few things,
but you can’t?

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:03.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us tend to compare ourselves

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
to other imperfect humans

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adopt the thinking of the masses.

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Movies and television

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
have blinded many to reality,

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
making them feel
that the beauty of the human body

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:22.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
must look like the handsome
and beautiful movie stars

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and famed athletes.

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, comparing ourselves to them

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often be very disappointing,

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
time consuming, and even expensive

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you go to great lengths

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to look more like another person.

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that some have been born

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a physical impairment or disability.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:53.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may be obvious to others,

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:57.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some unkind people
might have made comments

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
or teased the person.

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can make the person feel self-conscious

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even create a feeling of low self-esteem.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:12.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can become so ingrained
in one’s thinking

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he might begin to feel
no one could love him.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at times, that kind of erroneous thinking

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
can even affect a person’s view

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s love.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, please be assured

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah loves us

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our physical appearance.

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been said, “Beauty is only skin-deep.”

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
It fades with time.

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just look at a picture of yourself

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:52.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you were, let’s say, 17,

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:56.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then look at one
when you are in your 80’s.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
You say, “That’s not me.”

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, it is!

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans are sometimes enamored
by appearances.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t mean to do this,

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we may get caught up in this trap.

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:18.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
A faithful prophet of Jehovah
fell into this type of reasoning.

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:21.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember when Jehovah told Samuel

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anoint the next king of Israel?

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:27.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Samuel 16:3,

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told Samuel to go
to Jesse in Bethlehem,

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there He said:

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must anoint for me
the one whom I designate to you.”

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have that in your mind?

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Samuel, you must anoint

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one whom I designate to you.’

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:03:55.964 --> 00:04:00.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuel defaulted
to the way humans sometimes view others,

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
or appearances.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read what happened.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s recorded at 1 Samuel 16:6.

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:11.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads:

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they came in and he saw Eliab,

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he said: ‘Surely here before Jehovah

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
stands his anointed one.’”

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:28.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuel didn’t really know Eliab.

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:31.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was impressed with his appearance.

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was tall

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:37.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely a good-looking man.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read along with me on the screen verse 7.

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:48.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s way of assessing our worth
before him is very different.

00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:51.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 7 says:

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:54.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jehovah said to Samuel:

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:58.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not pay attention
to his appearance

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:01.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and how tall he is,

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for I have rejected him.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[now note this]

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:07.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For the way man sees

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:11.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is not the way God sees,

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:15.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because mere man sees
what appears to the eyes,

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:19.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s view of beauty
is different from ours.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Close your literal eyes for a minute,
and see with your mind’s eye

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful bird.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now open your eyes.

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which bird did you see?

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it an indigo bunting,

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
a cardinal, or a Baltimore oriole?

00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:46.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are beautiful birds.

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:51.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does Jehovah prefer one bird over another

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
just because of its beauty or appearance?

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:59.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
What bird did Jesus choose

00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:03.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
in teaching his disciples
a valuable lesson about Jehovah?

00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:06.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used a sparrow

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:11.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a plain, somewhat drab-looking little bird

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
of small monetary value.

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:17.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow along on-screen as I read

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:20.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 10:29-31:

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:25.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value,
do they not?

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet not one of them will fall to the ground

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:32.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“without your Father’s knowledge.

00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:37.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But even the hairs of your head
are all numbered.

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:39.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So have no fear;

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are worth more than many sparrows.”

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:48.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus represented Jehovah’s view

00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:52.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those
who have dedicated themselves to him

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are trying to remain faithful.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:02.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah likely notices
when an indigo bunting,

00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:07.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
a cardinal, or a Baltimore oriole
falls to the ground.

00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:10.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus made a significant point

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:15.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he chose to use
a sparrow in his illustration.

00:07:16.164 --> 00:07:19.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is not impressed

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:22.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the beauty of one’s physical appearance.

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves us as much as he loves

00:07:25.507 --> 00:07:28.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of his faithful servants

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our appearance.

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:36.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus went a step further and said:

00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:41.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are worth more than many sparrows.”

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not just a bird.

00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:47.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are a precious human

00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:50.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has come to know and love Jehovah.

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:56.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves you, not because of your appearance

00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:59.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being handsome, drab-looking,

00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
short, heavy,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
skinny, bald,

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:07.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautiful, less-than-beautiful,

00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:12.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
having warts or a limp or missing limbs,

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:16.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
being cross-eyed
or having a different skin color

00:08:16.683 --> 00:08:19.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
or shape of your eyes.

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah loves you

00:08:22.147 --> 00:08:26.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of who you are at heart.

00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:32.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what Jehovah told Samuel?

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:39.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:44.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah looks at you and sees

00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:47.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the secret person of the heart”

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:50.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that came to love your God,

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:52.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Universal Sovereign.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot take that aspect away
from the attention of Jehovah.

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you love him like Jesus indicates you can,

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:03.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loves you

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:07.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite any external appearances.

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:12.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll likely remember what Jesus said
at Mark 12:30:

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:16.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:09:16.284 --> 00:09:19.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your whole heart

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:22.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with your whole soul

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:24.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with your whole mind

00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:27.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with your whole strength.”

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s it!

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:32.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not add

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:35.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your good looks.”

00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:39.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, your appearance is not a factor

00:09:39.724 --> 00:09:44.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your love for Jehovah or his love for you.

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:50.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you say: “I’m crippled in both feet.

00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:52.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have trouble walking.

00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:55.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel dead inside.”

00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not the first servant of Jehovah
to feel that way.

00:10:00.412 --> 00:10:03.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth evidently felt that way.

00:10:03.832 --> 00:10:06.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
He too was crippled in both feet.

00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:10.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
King David had just honored him

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
by promising to give him property

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:16.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the privilege
of eating his meals with the king.

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Mephibosheth

00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:21.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt about himself

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:23.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel 9:8:

00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:26.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What is your servant,

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:31.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have turned your attention
to a dead dog like me?”

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:36.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not have a high opinion of himself.

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:40.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sounds like low self-esteem, doesn’t it?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a physical impairment
or a defect,

00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:48.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re not dead

00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
but very much alive in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:54.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to what Jehovah tells you

00:10:54.257 --> 00:10:56.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Malachi 4:2:

00:10:58.053 --> 00:11:00.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But on you who honor my name,

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:03.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the sun of righteousness will shine,

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:06.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with healing in its rays;

00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will skip about
like fattened calves.”

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:15.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do what you can
with what you have to work with

00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:17.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing Jehovah loves you

00:11:17.113 --> 00:11:21.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ultimately will correct
any physical problem.

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:25.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll then be able to live for all eternity

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:28.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
without any concerns about your appearance.

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:32.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s talk about Jehovah’s love for us

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:35.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our imperfections.

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a human, you’re imperfect.

00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:44.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, that’s just the way it is.

00:11:44.724 --> 00:11:48.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam passed imperfection on to all of us.

00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:54.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being imperfect, we will all make mistakes.

00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:57.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all do without exception.

00:11:59.155 --> 00:12:03.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll be embarrassed
at your imperfect reaction at times.

00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:05.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it happens.

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:08.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows our condition.

00:12:08.832 --> 00:12:13.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows what Adam handed down to us.

00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:18.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he still loves us despite imperfection.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really is not our fault.

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:27.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can Jehovah still love us
when we make mistakes,

00:12:27.892 --> 00:12:31.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
use poor judgment on occasion,

00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:35.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at times fall into serious sin

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
(though we’re sorry and repentant afterward)?

00:12:39.696 --> 00:12:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:48.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Mark 10:45 from the screen:

00:12:49.623 --> 00:12:52.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For even the Son of man came,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not to be ministered to,

00:12:55.128 --> 00:12:58.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but to minister and to give his life

00:12:58.381 --> 00:13:02.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a ransom in exchange for many.”

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:06.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus absorbs our mistakes.

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:11.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is possible
because he gave his perfect human life for us

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:14.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
in exchange for what Adam lost

00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and passed on to us.

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:22.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look with me at 1 Corinthians 15:22:

00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:27.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For just as in Adam all are dying,

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:32.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
so also in the Christ
all will be made alive.”

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:34.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s beautiful.

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:39.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not hold
our imperfections against us.

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:43.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as we acknowledge our imperfections

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:46.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel remorse and are repentant,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loves us despite the issue.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:1-5

00:13:55.355 --> 00:13:59.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that in time humans will experience

00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
the removal of tears,

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
mourning, outcry,

00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:07.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
pain, and even death.

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:10.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these painful situations

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:14.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
are based on the sin of Adam.

00:14:14.874 --> 00:14:18.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will then be gone.

00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:21.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
For obedient humans,

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
this means a return

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the perfect state enjoyed by man

00:14:26.553 --> 00:14:28.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the beginning of human history

00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:31.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the garden of Eden.

00:14:31.349 --> 00:14:33.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
So humans will be able to enjoy

00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:37.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only perfection as to faith and love

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:42.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
but perfection as to sinlessness.

00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:48.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, they’ll measure up
fully and faultlessly

00:14:48.074 --> 00:14:51.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s righteous standards for humans.

00:14:52.245 --> 00:14:55.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine that glorious time?

00:14:56.207 --> 00:14:59.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, perfection at that time

00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:02.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not mean an end to variety,

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
as some persons often assume.

00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:08.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
The animal kingdom,

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:11.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the product
of Jehovah’s perfect activity,

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:14.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
contains enormous variety.

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:20.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our perfect earth
is likewise filled with variety,

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:22.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
change, and contrast.

00:15:23.943 --> 00:15:27.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows for the simple and the complex,

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
the plain and the fancy,

00:15:30.992 --> 00:15:34.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sour and the sweet,

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:38.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rough and the smooth,

00:15:38.124 --> 00:15:41.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
the meadows and the woods,

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:44.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mountains and the valleys.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:48.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
It embraces the stimulating freshness

00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:50.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
of early spring,

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:54.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
the warmth of summer,

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
the loveliness of autumn colors,

00:15:56.893 --> 00:15:59.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the pure beauty

00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:02.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
of freshly fallen snow.

00:16:04.025 --> 00:16:07.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perfect humans will not be stereotypes

00:16:07.028 --> 00:16:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
with identical personalities,
talents, and abilities.

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:14.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the beauty is that

00:16:14.369 --> 00:16:18.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all of the variety of appearances,

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:21.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
talents, and personalities,

00:16:21.334 --> 00:16:25.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfection will be no more.

00:16:26.798 --> 00:16:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please be assured that,

00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:31.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ve considered from the Scriptures,

00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:35.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves each one of us

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:39.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our appearances or imperfections.

00:16:40.228 --> 00:16:42.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all fully love

00:16:42.897 --> 00:16:45.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adore Jehovah

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:49.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son, Christ Jesus, in return!
