00:00:01 As Jehovah’s servants,
00:00:03 nothing brings us greater joy
00:00:05 than worshipping the true God.
00:00:08 But we are also human.
00:00:11 This means that from time to time,
00:00:13 any of us can—and probably will—
00:00:16 experience unsettling moments,
00:00:19 times when we question our worth.
00:00:22 For example,
00:00:24 have you ever wondered about your true value in Jehovah’s eyes?
00:00:29 Have you ever experienced moments of anxiety
00:00:32 about your place in his organization?
00:00:36 Or have you struggled with feelings of worthlessness?
00:00:40 Such thoughts can erode our joy,
00:00:44 and we might even begin to doubt our personal worth to Jehovah.
00:00:49 If that has happened to you, you’re not alone.
00:00:53 Centuries ago, the writer of Psalm 94 revealed
00:00:57 that he too was overwhelmed by anxieties.
00:01:01 Let’s read it together.
00:01:03 At Psalm 94:19,
00:01:06 the writer is addressing Jehovah:
00:01:10 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:01:13 you comforted and soothed me.”
00:01:15 Now, notice the footnote on verse 19:
00:01:18 “disquieting thoughts.”
00:01:21 These can arise from factors such as guilt
00:01:25 over the fact that we cannot do more in the ministry
00:01:29 or in the congregation;
00:01:31 fear of the future, of being separated from the ones we know and love;
00:01:36 and despair from being overlooked,
00:01:39 feeling that we don’t really matter.
00:01:42 “Disquieting thoughts” are real
00:01:45 and can overwhelm us at times.
00:01:48 They can rob us of our inner peace and our sleep.
00:01:52 And if we’re not careful, they can even stifle our prayers,
00:01:56 damaging our relationship with Jehovah.
00:01:59 Nothing would make Satan happier.
00:02:02 We never want that to happen, especially now,
00:02:06 since this old world is so near to closing.
00:02:10 So, what can help us to soothe
00:02:12 these disquieting thoughts?
00:02:15 In this month’s broadcast, we will find the answer
00:02:18 in a heartwarming prophecy.
00:02:21 We hope that this inspired message
00:02:23 will provide a strong Scriptural basis to help you
00:02:27 to dispel any feelings of inadequacy.
00:02:31 Which prophecy?
00:02:33 Well, please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter 56.
00:02:37 Here we read of one of the most touching expressions
00:02:40 of Jehovah’s appreciation for two groups of people.
00:02:44 Both groups wanted to serve Jehovah,
00:02:47 but under the Mosaic Law, they were limited
00:02:51 or even disqualified from fully participating
00:02:54 in Jehovah’s arrangement for pure worship.
00:02:57 Who were they?
00:02:59 Let’s read Isaiah 56:3:
00:03:04 “The foreigner who joins himself to Jehovah
00:03:08 “should not say,
00:03:09 “‘Jehovah will surely separate me
00:03:12 “from his people.’
00:03:13 “And the eunuch should not say, ‘Look!
00:03:16 I am a dried-up tree.’”
00:03:19 Did you notice the two groups?
00:03:21 Foreigners, or non-Israelites,
00:03:24 and eunuchs, men who physically could not produce children.
00:03:29 They faced very difficult and possibly disheartening circumstances.
00:03:35 During Isaiah’s time, uncircumcised foreigners
00:03:39 were allowed to live in Israel,
00:03:41 but they had no permanent ties with the nation.
00:03:44 Because of their status, they could not eat the Passover meal,
00:03:49 and as a protection,
00:03:51 the Israelites were not to associate closely with them.
00:03:55 But many foreigners came to love Jehovah,
00:03:59 converted to pure worship,
00:04:01 and served Jehovah alongside his people.
00:04:04 They were called proselytes.
00:04:08 Nevertheless, even they could not fully become part of the nation of Israel.
00:04:14 How would you feel if you were a foreigner alive at that time?
00:04:19 Your biggest fear would be getting cut off from God’s people.
00:04:23 Might you have disquieting thoughts at times?
00:04:27 Consider the second group.
00:04:29 Isaiah mentioned eunuchs.
00:04:32 These were men who had their reproductive organs removed.
00:04:37 It was the custom of Eastern pagan nations
00:04:40 to make eunuchs out of some of the male children taken captive in war
00:04:45 and then assign them to serve as trusted officials
00:04:48 in royal courts or in other settings.
00:04:52 It appears that during the days of Isaiah,
00:04:54 some of these Gentile eunuchs learned about Jehovah, came to love him,
00:04:59 and decided to align themselves with Jehovah’s people.
00:05:04 These eunuchs enjoyed a measure of acceptance among Jehovah’s people,
00:05:09 and they had the privilege of worshipping Jehovah.
00:05:12 However, because they were eunuchs,
00:05:15 they could not become fully-fledged members of the congregation of Israel.
00:05:21 Plus, at that time and in that culture,
00:05:25 they suffered great humiliation in not being able to father children.
00:05:30 Do you think they experienced disquieting thoughts at times?
00:05:35 We know they did.
00:05:37 But Isaiah reveals something significant about this group.
00:05:42 Jehovah loved them!
00:05:44 In effect, Jehovah says to them:
00:05:47 “I know how you feel.
00:05:50 Now let me tell you how I feel about you.”
00:05:54 Let’s read Isaiah 56:4, 5:
00:06:02 “For this is what Jehovah says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths
00:06:06 “and who choose what I delight in and who hold fast to my covenant:
00:06:10 “‘I will give to them in my house
00:06:13 “‘and within my walls
00:06:15 “‘a monument and a name,
00:06:17 “‘something better than sons and daughters.
00:06:20 “‘An everlasting name I will give them,
00:06:23 one that will not perish.’”
00:06:26 I will give them “something better than sons and daughters”
00:06:29 —“an everlasting name.”
00:06:32 Their physical limitations
00:06:34 did not diminish their value in the eyes of our loving God.
00:06:39 Because of their whole-souled obedience to him,
00:06:43 Jehovah would always remember them.
00:06:45 They would have an everlasting name,
00:06:48 “one that [would] not perish.”
00:06:51 Jehovah treasured these faithful ones so much
00:06:54 that he kept the memory of their service
00:06:56 “in [his] house and within [his] walls”
00:06:59 like “a monument,” so as to cherish them daily.
00:07:04 Imagine how those eunuchs felt now,
00:07:07 knowing that their God had something special reserved for them.
00:07:12 They knew Jehovah had heard their prayers.
00:07:14 They knew that their God felt compassion for them.
00:07:18 All those disquieting thoughts started to melt away.
00:07:22 Those comforting words started to heal their broken spirit.
00:07:27 But why did Jehovah make these promises to these two groups?
00:07:32 What did he see that others may not have?
00:07:36 We don’t have all the details, but we do have some.
00:07:40 They are revealed to us much later in time,
00:07:44 and they give us valuable clues.
00:07:47 For example, in the book of Nehemiah,
00:07:51 we are introduced to two foreigners
00:07:53 who were living among God’s people.
00:07:56 There’s a significant detail about their names.
00:08:00 Nehemiah 3:7 tells us that they were
00:08:04 “Melatiah the Gibeonite
00:08:07 and Jadon the Meronothite,”
00:08:10 who were of foreign descent.
00:08:13 Yet, their names tell a different story.
00:08:16 What do they mean?
00:08:18 Melatiah means “Jah Has Provided Escape.”
00:08:22 Jadon means “Jehovah Has Given Ear.”
00:08:27 How did they get those names?
00:08:29 These men were likely born in Babylon,
00:08:32 children of foreigners who joined in true worship in Israel
00:08:37 and who were later taken captive in 607 B.C.E.
00:08:42 The parents of these men were not natural Israelites.
00:08:46 However, the names they chose for their children
00:08:50 reflected their devotion and love for Jehovah’s name.
00:08:55 And the fact that these sons of non-Israelites
00:08:59 would want to share in rebuilding Jerusalem
00:09:02 shows how they themselves loved Jehovah.
00:09:07 How did Jehovah feel about these foreigners?
00:09:10 Notice his prophetic words as we continue on
00:09:14 at Isaiah 56:6, 7:
00:09:20 “As for the foreigners who join themselves to Jehovah to minister to him,
00:09:25 “to love the name of Jehovah and to be his servants,
00:09:28 “all those who keep the Sabbath and do not profane it
00:09:32 “and who hold fast to my covenant, I will also bring them
00:09:36 “to my holy mountain and make them rejoice
00:09:39 “inside my house of prayer.
00:09:41 “Their whole burnt offerings
00:09:42 “and their sacrifices
00:09:44 “will be accepted on my altar.
00:09:46 “For my house will be called
00:09:48 a house of prayer for all the peoples.”
00:09:52 Jehovah noticed that these foreigners
00:09:54 faithfully observed the laws of a covenant
00:09:57 that they could never be fully a part of.
00:10:00 In verses 6 and 7,
00:10:02 Jehovah was, in effect, inviting them into his home
00:10:07 —“a house of prayer for all the peoples”—
00:10:09 Jew and foreigner alike.
00:10:12 Hearing these words must have lifted their heavy hearts.
00:10:16 But Jehovah did more than just tell them how much he valued them.
00:10:20 He showed them.
00:10:22 How?
00:10:25 Among the foreigners who returned to the ruins of Jerusalem
00:10:27 in 537 B.C.E.
00:10:30 were a particular group of foreigners who had become proselytes.
00:10:35 And they included descendants of the Gibeonites,
00:10:38 a nation that had joined themselves to Israel
00:10:41 and served as “gatherers of wood and drawers of water
00:10:45 for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.”
00:10:49 These descendants of the Gibeonites
00:10:51 had spent decades as captives in Babylon
00:10:54 for crimes they did not commit.
00:10:57 They had no land inheritance back in Israel; they were servants.
00:11:02 Yet, they traveled back to Israel
00:11:04 and helped rebuild the temple and the walls of Jerusalem.
00:11:08 What motivated them?
00:11:10 They loved Jehovah.
00:11:13 These descendants of Gibeon
00:11:15 expected nothing in return for their service,
00:11:18 but they did receive something quite unexpected.
00:11:22 After the Israelites received their apportioned land,
00:11:26 this group called the Nethinim,
00:11:28 who did not have a land inheritance,
00:11:30 were assigned a place to live.
00:11:33 Where would they be placed?
00:11:35 Outside the city?
00:11:36 In a slum?
00:11:37 In some abandoned part of forgotten Jerusalem?
00:11:41 No!
00:11:42 The Bible tells us that they were assigned to live in Ophel.
00:11:46 Now take a look at the map,
00:11:47 and see for yourself where Ophel is located
00:11:51 —right next to the temple!
00:11:54 Jehovah made these humble “gatherers of wood” his neighbors.
00:11:59 This underscores how much Jehovah loved and cherished these faithful foreigners
00:12:03 who, motivated by love,
00:12:05 did all they could to share in his worship.
00:12:09 What’s the lesson?
00:12:11 Both the eunuchs and the foreigners were limited
00:12:14 in what they could do in God’s service.
00:12:17 From a human standpoint, they were probably considered
00:12:21 less than ordinary, nothing special;
00:12:25 perhaps some even considered them outcasts.
00:12:29 That is not how Jehovah viewed them.
00:12:32 He knew each one by name,
00:12:34 he listened to their prayers,
00:12:37 and he viewed each individual as a precious gem.
00:12:42 Where man sees the ordinary,
00:12:44 our heavenly Father sees the extraordinary.
00:12:48 To illustrate:
00:12:50 What do you see here?
00:12:52 If you are thinking sand, you are right.
00:12:55 Sand is one of the most common substances on the earth.
00:12:59 To us, it typically looks bland and ordinary,
00:13:03 each particle identical to the next
00:13:06 —no color, no sparkle.
00:13:08 You never see someone show off a sand necklace or bracelet.
00:13:13 But what happens if you look at sand
00:13:16 under the microscope?
00:13:18 To the naked eye, all sand looks the same and is pretty dull.
00:13:23 But magnified a hundredfold or more,
00:13:27 each individual grain of sand reveals distinct beauty.
00:13:31 We see parts of shells and crystals,
00:13:33 all contrasting in shapes and colors.
00:13:37 There is a treasure trove in a handful of sand.
00:13:42 That is how Jehovah sees each of you.
00:13:46 Just as he saw the faithful foreigners and eunuchs
00:13:50 for the precious gems that they were,
00:13:52 he sees you too.
00:13:54 Yes, you who may be restricted by age,
00:13:58 health, physical stamina, emotions, or family responsibilities
00:14:03 from doing as much in some spiritual activities
00:14:06 as you would like to.
00:14:08 But those limitations do not define you.
00:14:13 Remember that in God’s eyes, your worth as a person
00:14:17 is not measured by how much you do
00:14:20 but, rather, how much you try.
00:14:23 With eternity and perfection in view,
00:14:26 Jehovah chooses to see, not your limitations,
00:14:30 but your potential.
00:14:33 When you serve Jehovah whole-souled
00:14:36 despite limited circumstances,
00:14:38 you sparkle in his eyes.
00:14:42 And because you shine so brightly in Jehovah’s heart,
00:14:45 he will always help you.
00:14:47 He will always cherish you.
00:14:50 Do you remember the faithful psalmist who wrote
00:14:52 about being overwhelmed by disquieting thoughts
00:14:56 at Psalm 94:19?
00:14:59 In the very next line, he tells Jehovah:
00:15:02 “You comforted and soothed me.”
00:15:05 By the way, who wrote that psalm?
00:15:09 We don’t know his name, but Jehovah does.
00:15:12 And he carefully preserved that unknown writer’s words
00:15:16 for thousands of years in the Bible.
00:15:20 Like the psalmist, the foreigner, the eunuch
00:15:23 —no matter the circumstances—
00:15:25 when you humbly serve Jehovah, when you try your best,
00:15:29 your work is never fruitless.
00:15:32 An everlasting name is reserved for each of you
00:15:35 because your heavenly Father cherishes you.
