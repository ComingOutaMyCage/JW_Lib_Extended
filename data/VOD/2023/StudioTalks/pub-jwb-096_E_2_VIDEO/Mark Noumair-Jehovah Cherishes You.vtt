As Jehovah’s servants,

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.455 line:10% position:50% align:center
nothing brings us greater joy

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:08.558 line:10% position:50% align:center
than worshipping the true God.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:11.261 line:10% position:50% align:center
But we are also human.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that from time to time,

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of us can—and probably will—

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
experience unsettling moments,

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
times when we question our worth.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:24.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
have you ever wondered
about your true value in Jehovah’s eyes?

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:32.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever experienced moments of anxiety

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:36.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
about your place in his organization?

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:40.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or have you struggled
with feelings of worthlessness?

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:44.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such thoughts can erode our joy,

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we might even begin to doubt
our personal worth to Jehovah.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that has happened to you,
you’re not alone.

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:57.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries ago,
the writer of Psalm 94 revealed

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he too was overwhelmed by anxieties.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:03.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it together.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:09.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
the writer is addressing Jehovah:

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
you comforted and soothed me.”

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice the footnote on verse 19:

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“disquieting thoughts.”

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:25.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
These can arise from factors such as guilt

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the fact that we cannot do more
in the ministry

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the congregation;

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
fear of the future, of being separated
from the ones we know and love;

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:39.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and despair from being overlooked,

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
feeling that we don’t really matter.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:45.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Disquieting thoughts” are real

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:48.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can overwhelm us at times.

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:52.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can rob us of our inner peace
and our sleep.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:56.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re not careful,
they can even stifle our prayers,

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
damaging our relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing would make Satan happier.

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:06.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never want that to happen, especially now,

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:10.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
since this old world is so near to closing.

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:12.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us to soothe

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
these disquieting thoughts?

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:18.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s broadcast,
we will find the answer

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a heartwarming prophecy.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that this inspired message

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:27.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
will provide a strong Scriptural basis
to help you

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:31.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dispel any feelings of inadequacy.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which prophecy?

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, please open your Bible
to Isaiah chapter 56.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read
of one of the most touching expressions

00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:44.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s appreciation
for two groups of people.

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:47.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both groups wanted to serve Jehovah,

00:02:47.984 --> 00:02:51.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
but under the Mosaic Law, they were limited

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even disqualified from fully participating

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:57.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s arrangement for pure worship.

00:02:57.727 --> 00:02:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who were they?

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:03.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Isaiah 56:3:

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:08.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The foreigner who joins himself to Jehovah

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:09.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should not say,

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Jehovah will surely separate me

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from his people.’

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the eunuch should not say, ‘Look!

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:18.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am a dried-up tree.’”

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:21.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the two groups?

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:24.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Foreigners, or non-Israelites,

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:29.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eunuchs, men who physically
could not produce children.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
They faced very difficult
and possibly disheartening circumstances.

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:39.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
During Isaiah’s time,
uncircumcised foreigners

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
were allowed to live in Israel,

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they had no permanent ties
with the nation.

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of their status,
they could not eat the Passover meal,

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:51.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a protection,

00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:55.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Israelites were not to associate closely
with them.

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:59.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
But many foreigners came to love Jehovah,

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:01.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
converted to pure worship,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served Jehovah alongside his people.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:08.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were called proselytes.

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:13.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, even they could not fully
become part of the nation of Israel.

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:19.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel
if you were a foreigner alive at that time?

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your biggest fear would be
getting cut off from God’s people.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Might you have disquieting thoughts at times?

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:29.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the second group.

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:32.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah mentioned eunuchs.

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:37.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were men
who had their reproductive organs removed.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the custom of Eastern pagan nations

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:45.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make eunuchs out of some
of the male children taken captive in war

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then assign them
to serve as trusted officials

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
in royal courts or in other settings.

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:54.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears that during the days of Isaiah,

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:59.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of these Gentile eunuchs
learned about Jehovah, came to love him,

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:03.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided to align themselves
with Jehovah’s people.

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:09.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
These eunuchs enjoyed a measure
of acceptance among Jehovah’s people,

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:12.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had the privilege
of worshipping Jehovah.

00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:15.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, because they were eunuchs,

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:20.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could not become fully-fledged members
of the congregation of Israel.

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:25.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Plus, at that time and in that culture,

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:29.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
they suffered great humiliation
in not being able to father children.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think they experienced
disquieting thoughts at times?

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know they did.

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Isaiah reveals something significant
about this group.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved them!

00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:47.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, Jehovah says to them:

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I know how you feel.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:54.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let me tell you how I feel about you.”

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Isaiah 56:4, 5:

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:06.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this is what Jehovah says
to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths

00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who choose what I delight in
and who hold fast to my covenant:

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will give to them in my house

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and within my walls

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:17.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a monument and a name,

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:20.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘something better than sons and daughters.

00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:23.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘An everlasting name I will give them,

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that will not perish.’”

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give them
“something better than sons and daughters”

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“an everlasting name.”

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their physical limitations

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not diminish their value
in the eyes of our loving God.

00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:43.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of their whole-souled obedience
to him,

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:45.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would always remember them.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would have an everlasting name,

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one that [would] not perish.”

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah treasured these faithful ones so much

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he kept the memory of their service

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:59.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in [his] house and within [his] walls”

00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:03.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “a monument,”
so as to cherish them daily.

00:07:04.907 --> 00:07:07.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how those eunuchs felt now,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that their God
had something special reserved for them.

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew Jehovah had heard their prayers.

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:18.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that their God
felt compassion for them.

00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:22.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
All those disquieting thoughts
started to melt away.

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those comforting words
started to heal their broken spirit.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:32.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why did Jehovah make these promises
to these two groups?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:36.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he see that others may not have?

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have all the details,
but we do have some.

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:44.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are revealed to us much later in time,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they give us valuable clues.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the book of Nehemiah,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are introduced to two foreigners

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were living among God’s people.

00:07:56.626 --> 00:08:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a significant detail
about their names.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah 3:7 tells us that they were

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Melatiah the Gibeonite

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:10.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jadon the Meronothite,”

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were of foreign descent.

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:16.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, their names tell a different story.

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do they mean?

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Melatiah means “Jah Has Provided Escape.”

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jadon means “Jehovah Has Given Ear.”

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they get those names?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men were likely born in Babylon,

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:37.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
children of foreigners
who joined in true worship in Israel

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:42.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who were later taken captive
in 607 B.C.E.

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parents of these men
were not natural Israelites.

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:50.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the names they chose
for their children

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:54.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflected their devotion and love
for Jehovah’s name.

00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:59.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact
that these sons of non-Israelites

00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:02.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
would want to share in rebuilding Jerusalem

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:07.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows how they themselves loved Jehovah.

00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:10.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah feel about these foreigners?

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice his prophetic words as we continue on

00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 56:6, 7:

00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:25.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As for the foreigners who join themselves
to Jehovah to minister to him,

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to love the name of Jehovah
and to be his servants,

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:32.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all those who keep the Sabbath
and do not profane it

00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:36.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who hold fast to my covenant,
I will also bring them

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:39.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
“to my holy mountain and make them rejoice

00:09:39.195 --> 00:09:41.397 line:10% position:50% align:center
“inside my house of prayer.

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:42.999 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Their whole burnt offerings

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.433 line:10% position:50% align:center
“and their sacrifices

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:46.569 line:10% position:50% align:center
“will be accepted on my altar.

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:48.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
“For my house will be called

00:09:48.237 --> 00:09:51.507 line:10% position:50% align:center
a house of prayer for all the peoples.”

00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:54.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah noticed that these foreigners

00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithfully observed the laws of a covenant

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could never be fully a part of.

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:02.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 6 and 7,

00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was, in effect,
inviting them into his home

00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:09.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“a house of prayer for all the peoples”—

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:12.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jew and foreigner alike.

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:16.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hearing these words
must have lifted their heavy hearts.

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:20.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah did more than just tell them
how much he valued them.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed them.

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:25.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among the foreigners
who returned to the ruins of Jerusalem

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 537 B.C.E.

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:35.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
were a particular group of foreigners
who had become proselytes.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:38.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they included descendants
of the Gibeonites,

00:10:38.587 --> 00:10:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
a nation that had joined themselves to Israel

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served as “gatherers of wood
and drawers of water

00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:49.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.”

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
These descendants of the Gibeonites

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
had spent decades as captives in Babylon

00:10:54.537 --> 00:10:57.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
for crimes they did not commit.

00:10:57.306 --> 00:11:02.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had no land inheritance back in Israel;
they were servants.

00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:04.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they traveled back to Israel

00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:08.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped rebuild the temple
and the walls of Jerusalem.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
What motivated them?

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:13.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
They loved Jehovah.

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
These descendants of Gibeon

00:11:15.157 --> 00:11:18.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
expected nothing in return for their service,

00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:22.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they did receive
something quite unexpected.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the Israelites received
their apportioned land,

00:11:26.202 --> 00:11:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
this group called the Nethinim,

00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:30.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
who did not have a land inheritance,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
were assigned a place to live.

00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:35.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where would they be placed?

00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Outside the city?

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:37.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a slum?

00:11:37.913 --> 00:11:41.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some abandoned part
of forgotten Jerusalem?

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:46.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible tells us
that they were assigned to live in Ophel.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now take a look at the map,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.694 line:10% position:50% align:center
and see for yourself where Ophel is located

00:11:51.694 --> 00:11:54.530 line:10% position:50% align:center
—right next to the temple!

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:59.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made these humble
“gatherers of wood” his neighbors.

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:03.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
This underscores how much Jehovah loved
and cherished these faithful foreigners

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, motivated by love,

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:09.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
did all they could to share in his worship.

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:11.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:12:11.714 --> 00:12:14.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both the eunuchs and the foreigners
were limited

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what they could do in God’s service.

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
From a human standpoint,
they were probably considered

00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:25.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
less than ordinary, nothing special;

00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps some even considered them outcasts.

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:32.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not how Jehovah viewed them.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew each one by name,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
he listened to their prayers,

00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:41.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he viewed each individual
as a precious gem.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where man sees the ordinary,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
our heavenly Father sees the extraordinary.

00:12:48.584 --> 00:12:50.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:52.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you see here?

00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:55.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are thinking sand, you are right.

00:12:55.624 --> 00:12:59.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sand is one of the most common substances
on the earth.

00:12:59.228 --> 00:13:03.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
To us, it typically looks bland and ordinary,

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:06.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
each particle identical to the next

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:08.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no color, no sparkle.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:13.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
You never see someone show off
a sand necklace or bracelet.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happens if you look at sand

00:13:16.812 --> 00:13:18.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the microscope?

00:13:18.848 --> 00:13:23.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the naked eye, all sand looks the same
and is pretty dull.

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:27.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
But magnified a hundredfold or more,

00:13:27.022 --> 00:13:31.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
each individual grain of sand
reveals distinct beauty.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see parts of shells and crystals,

00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:37.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
all contrasting in shapes and colors.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:41.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a treasure trove
in a handful of sand.

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how Jehovah sees each of you.

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:50.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as he saw
the faithful foreigners and eunuchs

00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the precious gems that they were,

00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:54.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
he sees you too.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you who may be restricted by age,

00:13:58.687 --> 00:14:03.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
health, physical stamina, emotions,
or family responsibilities

00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
from doing as much
in some spiritual activities

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:08.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you would like to.

00:14:08.497 --> 00:14:13.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those limitations do not define you.

00:14:13.335 --> 00:14:17.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that in God’s eyes,
your worth as a person

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:20.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not measured by how much you do

00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, how much you try.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eternity and perfection in view,

00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah chooses to see, not your limitations,

00:14:30.853 --> 00:14:33.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
but your potential.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you serve Jehovah whole-souled

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite limited circumstances,

00:14:38.928 --> 00:14:42.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
you sparkle in his eyes.

00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:45.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because you shine so brightly
in Jehovah’s heart,

00:14:45.768 --> 00:14:47.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will always help you.

00:14:47.836 --> 00:14:50.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will always cherish you.

00:14:50.673 --> 00:14:52.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
the faithful psalmist who wrote

00:14:52.908 --> 00:14:56.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
about being overwhelmed
by disquieting thoughts

00:14:56.412 --> 00:14:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 94:19?

00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:02.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the very next line, he tells Jehovah:

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:05.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You comforted and soothed me.”

00:15:05.854 --> 00:15:09.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, who wrote that psalm?

00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know his name, but Jehovah does.

00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:16.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he carefully preserved
that unknown writer’s words

00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
for thousands of years in the Bible.

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:23.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the psalmist, the foreigner, the eunuch

00:15:23.372 --> 00:15:25.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no matter the circumstances—

00:15:25.474 --> 00:15:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you humbly serve Jehovah,
when you try your best,

00:15:29.612 --> 00:15:32.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
your work is never fruitless.

00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:35.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
An everlasting name
is reserved for each of you

00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:39.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
because your heavenly Father cherishes you.
