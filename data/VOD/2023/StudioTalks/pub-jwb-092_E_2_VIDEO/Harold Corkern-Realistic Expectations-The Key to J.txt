00:00:02 When you hear the word “realistic,”
00:00:05 what comes to your mind?
00:00:08 “Realistic” conveys the idea of something that is practical,
00:00:11 rational, reasonable, and sensible.
00:00:16 Having expectations that are realistic
00:00:18 is essential to joy  and success in Jehovah’s service.
00:00:24 In contrast, unrealistic expectations
00:00:28 cause discouragement,
00:00:30 as Proverbs 13:12 says:
00:00:32 “Expectation postponed makes the heart sick,
00:00:37 but a desire realized is a tree of life.”
00:00:42 Appropriately, we often use this verse
00:00:45 when referring to expectations
00:00:47 that are not achieved  as quickly as we would like.
00:00:51 However, expectations that are too high
00:00:56 can also make our heart sick.
00:01:00 Notice this quote from the August 8, 1983, issue of  Awake!:
00:01:06 “Disappointment is often not so much a matter
00:01:09 “of ‘expectation postponed,’
00:01:12 “as expectations too high.
00:01:14 “Now at times it is good to have high goals,
00:01:17 “to ‘aim for the stars.’
00:01:20 “But always  expecting to come out on top
00:01:22 is a surefire way to beckon disappointment.”
00:01:28 To avoid disappointment,
00:01:30 our expectations should be reasonable and sensible.
00:01:35 In our discussion,
00:01:37 we’re going to answer the following three questions about our expectations:
00:01:43 (1) Why must we be realistic
00:01:47 about what we expect from ourselves?
00:01:51 (2) Why must we be realistic
00:01:54 in what we expect  from our brothers and sisters?
00:01:58 (3) Why is it realistic to expect
00:02:02 that Jehovah will reward us  for our faithful sacred service?
00:02:09 Our first question is,
00:02:11 Why must we be realistic  about what we expect from ourselves?
00:02:17 Of course, we love Jehovah with our whole heart, mind, and soul,
00:02:22 and we want to do everything for his glory.
00:02:26 However, the reality is
00:02:29 that no matter how much we love Jehovah and want to obey him,
00:02:33 we are sinful descendants of Adam.
00:02:36 As a result,
00:02:38 we occasionally transgress in thought, word, and deed.
00:02:43 Ecclesiastes 7:20 states:
00:02:46 “For there is no righteous man on earth
00:02:49 who always does good and never sins.”
00:02:53 And James 3:2 reads:
00:02:55 “For we all stumble many times.
00:02:59 “If anyone does not stumble in word,
00:03:01 he is a perfect man.”
00:03:04 Perhaps you can relate  to the feelings of the apostle Paul
00:03:07 at Romans 7:18-20:
00:03:12 “For I know that in me,
00:03:15 “that is, in my flesh,
00:03:17 “there dwells nothing good;
00:03:20 “for I have the desire to do what is fine
00:03:23 “but not the ability to carry it out.
00:03:26 “For I do not do the good that I wish,
00:03:30 “but the bad that I do not wish
00:03:32 “is what I practice.
00:03:35 “If, then, I do what I do not wish,
00:03:38 “I am no longer the one carrying it out,
00:03:41 but it is the sin dwelling in me.”
00:03:44 Paul’s struggle with his sinful flesh made him feel miserable.
00:03:50 At times,
00:03:51 we too might feel dejected,
00:03:54 disappointed,  and frustrated over our shortcomings.
00:04:00 We may begin to feel like a failure.
00:04:04 What enabled Paul to continue serving Jehovah with joy and zeal?
00:04:10 He honestly acknowledged his sinful condition
00:04:13 and had complete confidence in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
00:04:19 Paul went on to say at Romans 7:24, 25:
00:04:23 “Miserable man that I am!
00:04:26 “Who will rescue me
00:04:28 “from the body undergoing this death?
00:04:31 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!”
00:04:36 Yes, through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness
00:04:39 and his loving provision of the ransom,
00:04:42 we can confidently remain in Jehovah’s love
00:04:45 and render worship that’s acceptable to him,
00:04:48 even in our imperfect state.
00:04:52 How powerful is the ransom in allowing us to have a clean conscience
00:04:57 and retain Jehovah’s approval?
00:05:00 Acts 3:19 answers this question:
00:05:04 “Repent, therefore,
00:05:06 “and turn around so as to get your sins
00:05:09 “blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing
00:05:13 may come from Jehovah himself.”
00:05:16 The original-language word translated “blotted out”
00:05:19 means “to cause to disappear by wiping,”
00:05:23 “to remove so as to leave no trace.”
00:05:27 Jehovah completely wipes out our sin.
00:05:32 To illustrate:
00:05:34 Imagine a white writing surface
00:05:36 representing our clean standing before Jehovah.
00:05:39 Now imagine that red dots are drawn on it,
00:05:43 representing our sins.
00:05:45 We should not view the ransom as if Jehovah draws an  X
00:05:49 over each dot to cross them out.
00:05:52 Those red dots would still be visible.
00:05:55 Rather, we should imagine Jehovah,
00:05:58 based on the ransom, completely erasing the red dots
00:06:03 so that a clean,  white writing surface is restored.
00:06:07 Jehovah further reassures us  of the completeness of his forgiveness
00:06:12 with the words recorded at Psalm 103:12-14.
00:06:18 Jehovah ‘remembers that we are dust’
00:06:22 and does not expect perfection from us.
00:06:27 As a merciful Father,
00:06:30 he puts our sins “as far off  as the sunrise is from the sunset.”
00:06:36 Even if a servant of Jehovah  commits a serious sin,
00:06:40 if he is truly repentant with godly sadness,
00:06:45 his sin can be blotted out,
00:06:48 completely forgiven.
00:06:52 Therefore, it is essential for us to maintain
00:06:55 a reasonable, sensible,
00:06:58 realistic view of our imperfect state.
00:07:03 We’re going to make mistakes,
00:07:05 but we must have full trust in the reality
00:07:09 of Jehovah’s forgiveness based on the ransom.
00:07:13 Also, we can learn valuable lessons  from our errors
00:07:17 so that we’ll be less likely to repeat them.
00:07:22 We need patience, though,
00:07:24 because some personality flaws and bad habits
00:07:27 may not go away overnight.
00:07:30 Some of them may even be a lifelong battle.
00:07:36 At times, we may need counsel and discipline.
00:07:42 What should we realistically expect when receiving discipline?
00:07:46 Hebrews 12:11-13
00:07:49 makes it clear  that initially it will not “be joyous.”
00:07:55 “It is painful”!
00:07:57 However, when we humbly accept discipline
00:08:01 and apply the counsel,
00:08:03 we can be sure that we will gain inner peace
00:08:06 and be a better servant of Jehovah.
00:08:10 Therefore, do not give up,
00:08:14 but keep making progress.
00:08:17 Never allow the Devil  to convince you that you are a failure.
00:08:23 As stated in the September 1, 2001,
00:08:26 issue of  The Watchtower,  on page 18:
00:08:30 “Satan would like nothing better  than to rob you of your peace . . . .
00:08:35 “He would surely like you  to feel that your imperfection
00:08:38 “makes your service unacceptable to God.
00:08:41 Never allow the Devil to demoralize you!”
00:08:47 Our second question for consideration is,
00:08:50 Why must we be realistic
00:08:52 in what we expect from our brothers and sisters?
00:08:57 Just as it’s essential to avoid having expectations
00:09:01 that are too high for ourselves,
00:09:03 we must also avoid expecting too much from our brothers and sisters.
00:09:09 Such unreasonable expectations create stress,
00:09:13 disappointment, and frustration.
00:09:17 The  Awake!  of September 8, 1994,
00:09:20 quoted a factory supervisor who said:
00:09:24 “You have to accept people as they are.
00:09:28 “If you expect more than they can give,
00:09:31 “[you] will elevate the stress level,
00:09:33 making everyone unhappy.”
00:09:38 We should expect from our fellow workers
00:09:41 what Jehovah and Jesus expect from them.
00:09:46 Jesus’ illustration of the talents,
00:09:48 recorded in Matthew chapter 25, conveys their thinking.
00:09:54 The main point of this illustration is that the Master, Jesus,
00:09:58 expects each of his anointed brothers
00:10:01 —the slaves and, by extension, those who are of the other sheep—
00:10:06 to do his or her best
00:10:10 in the assigned work of preaching the good news.
00:10:14 How did Jesus distribute the work?
00:10:17 Matthew 25:15 provides the answer:
00:10:22 “He gave five talents to one,
00:10:26 “two to another,
00:10:28 “and one to still another,
00:10:31 “to each according to his own ability,
00:10:34 and he went abroad.”
00:10:36 Jehovah and Jesus are pleased with
00:10:40 and will reward each of us
00:10:42 when we do our best within our circumstances and ability.
00:10:48 When the slave with two talents  gained two more,
00:10:51 the master did not say to him,
00:10:54 ‘Why did you not gain five more  like your fellow slave?’
00:10:58 He gave the two-talent slave the same commendation
00:11:03 as the one who was given the five and gained five more:
00:11:08 “Well done, good and faithful slave!
00:11:12 “You were faithful over a few things.
00:11:15 “I will appoint you over many things.
00:11:18 Enter into the joy of your master.”
00:11:21 As a result,
00:11:23 the two-talent slave could be just as successful
00:11:27 and joyful as the five-talent slave.
00:11:31 They both met their master’s reasonable expectations,
00:11:36 and their master was joyful too.
00:11:40 What a fine lesson for all of us,
00:11:43 including those serving as elders!
00:11:45 In imitation of Jehovah and Jesus,
00:11:49 we should never put pressure on our brothers
00:11:52 to do more than they’re capable of doing.
00:11:55 Failure to take this reasonable and realistic approach
00:11:59 can result in much frustration.
00:12:04 Another way that we show  we have reasonable expectations
00:12:08 is to acknowledge  that from time to time disagreements
00:12:11 and hurt feelings will arise among our brothers.
00:12:16 Have you ever heard someone say,
00:12:18 “I expect to be treated that way by the world, but not by my brother”?
00:12:23 Is it reasonable to expect
00:12:26 that there will not be any  difficulties among brothers?
00:12:29 No.
00:12:31 Does Jesus expect that at times
00:12:33 his disciples will have difficulties  among themselves?
00:12:37 Yes.
00:12:39 Why can we say this?
00:12:42 Remember some of the expressions
00:12:44 Jesus used throughout the Sermon on the Mount:
00:12:49 “Happy are the peacemakers,  since they will be called sons of God.”
00:12:55 “If . . . you are bringing  your gift to the altar
00:12:57 “and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
00:13:02 “leave your gift there in front of the altar,  and go away.
00:13:07 “First make your peace with your brother,
00:13:10 and then come back and offer your gift.”
00:13:15 “Forgive us our debts,
00:13:17 as we also have forgiven our debtors.”
00:13:22 “Stop judging that you may not be judged.”
00:13:27 These verses show that Jesus knew his disciples
00:13:31 would have challenges among themselves.
00:13:33 That was a realistic expectation.
00:13:38 But it’s also reasonable  to conclude that these problems
00:13:41 can be successfully resolved  if godly principles are applied.
00:13:46 Then peace can be restored.
00:13:49 Additionally, we should expect some tensions
00:13:52 to arise among the brotherhood today.
00:13:55 But by applying Bible principles,
00:13:58 peace can be restored and maintained.
00:14:03 We’ll now consider our third question:
00:14:07 Why is it realistic to expect that Jehovah will reward us
00:14:10 for our faithful sacred service?
00:14:14 At Hebrews 11:6,
00:14:16 the Bible tells us that Jehovah
00:14:18 is “the rewarder  of those earnestly seeking him.”
00:14:23 And at 1 Corinthians 15:58,
00:14:25 the apostle Paul encourages us
00:14:27 to have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord,
00:14:31 knowing that your labor is not in vain.”
00:14:36 Paul was absolutely sure of his heavenly reward.
00:14:41 Despite his sins  prior to becoming a Christian
00:14:44 and his battles with sinful inclinations,
00:14:47 please note his confidence
00:14:49 expressed at 2 Timothy 4:7, 8:
00:14:55 “I have fought the fine fight,
00:14:58 “I have run the race to the finish,
00:15:01 “I have observed the faith.
00:15:03 “From this time on,
00:15:05 “there is reserved for me  the crown of righteousness,
00:15:09 “which the Lord, the righteous judge,
00:15:11 “will give me as a reward in that day,
00:15:14 “yet not to me only,
00:15:16 but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.”
00:15:21 We can have similar confidence in the reward Jehovah has promised,
00:15:26 whether our hope is heavenly
00:15:29 or to enjoy everlasting life  on a paradise earth!
00:15:34 This is a realistic expectation
00:15:37 because our reasonable and loving God has promised it,
00:15:41 and he does not lie.
00:15:43 Therefore, may we develop
00:15:47 and maintain realistic expectations for ourselves
00:15:51 and for our fellow workers.
00:15:54 May we never lose sight of the reality
00:15:57 that Jehovah will reward “those earnestly seeking him.”
00:16:03 If we have realistic expectations,
00:16:06 we can find joy and success in our service to Jehovah now,
00:16:10 as well as have the prospect of doing so forever.
