00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:05.155 line:10% position:50% align:center
When you hear the word “realistic,”

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10% position:50% align:center
what comes to your mind?

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Realistic” conveys the idea
of something that is practical,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
rational, reasonable, and sensible.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having expectations that are realistic

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential to joy 
and success in Jehovah’s service.

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:28.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, unrealistic expectations

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:30.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
cause discouragement,

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:32.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Proverbs 13:12 says:

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Expectation postponed makes the heart sick,

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a desire realized is a tree of life.”

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:45.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appropriately, we often use this verse

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
when referring to expectations

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are not achieved 
as quickly as we would like.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:56.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, expectations that are too high

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:58.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also make our heart sick.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice this quote
from the August 8, 1983, issue of <i> Awake!: </i>

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:09.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Disappointment is often not so much a matter

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:12.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of ‘expectation postponed,’

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as expectations too high.

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:17.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now at times it is good to have high goals,

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:20.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to ‘aim for the stars.’

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But <i>always </i> expecting to come out on top

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:27.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a surefire way to beckon disappointment.”

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
To avoid disappointment,

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:34.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
our expectations should be
reasonable and sensible.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:37.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our discussion,

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to answer the following
three questions about our expectations:

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Why must we be realistic

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:50.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what we expect from ourselves?

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:54.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Why must we be realistic

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we expect 
from our brothers and sisters?

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:02.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Why is it realistic to expect

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will reward us 
for our faithful sacred service?

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our first question is,

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:16.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why must we be realistic 
about what we expect from ourselves?

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:22.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we love Jehovah
with our whole heart, mind, and soul,

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to do everything for his glory.

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the reality is

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter how much we love Jehovah
and want to obey him,

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:36.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are sinful descendants of Adam.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
we occasionally transgress in thought,
word, and deed.

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:46.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 7:20 states:

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For there is no righteous man on earth

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
who always does good and never sins.”

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
And James 3:2 reads:

00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we all stumble many times.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone does not stumble in word,

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is a perfect man.”

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can relate 
to the feelings of the apostle Paul

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 7:18-20:

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:15.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I know that in me,

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is, in my flesh,

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:20.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there dwells nothing good;

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I have the desire to do what is fine

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:26.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but not the ability to carry it out.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I do not do the good that I wish,

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the bad that I do not wish

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:35.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is what I practice.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, then, I do what I do not wish,

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am no longer the one carrying it out,

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it is the sin dwelling in me.”

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:49.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s struggle with his sinful flesh
made him feel miserable.

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:51.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times,

00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:54.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
we too might feel dejected,

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:59.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
disappointed, 
and frustrated over our shortcomings.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may begin to feel like a failure.

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:08.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
What enabled Paul to continue
serving Jehovah with joy and zeal?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
He honestly acknowledged his sinful condition

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had complete confidence
in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:23.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul went on to say at Romans 7:24, 25:

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Miserable man that I am!

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:28.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will rescue me

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the body undergoing this death?

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!”

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his loving provision of the ransom,

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:45.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can confidently remain in Jehovah’s love

00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and render worship that’s acceptable to him,

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in our imperfect state.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:57.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
How powerful is the ransom
in allowing us to have a clean conscience

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and retain Jehovah’s approval?

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:03.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 3:19 answers this question:

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Repent, therefore,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and turn around so as to get your sins

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:13.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“blotted out,
so that seasons of refreshing

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
may come from Jehovah himself.”

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original-language word
translated “blotted out”

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:23.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “to cause to disappear by wiping,”

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:26.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to remove so as to leave no trace.”

00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah completely wipes out our sin.

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a white writing surface

00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
representing our clean standing
before Jehovah.

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now imagine that red dots are drawn on it,

00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:45.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
representing our sins.

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:49.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should not view the ransom
as if Jehovah draws an <i> X</i>

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:52.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
over each dot to cross them out.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those red dots would still be visible.

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we should imagine Jehovah,

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:03.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the ransom,
completely erasing the red dots

00:06:03.146 --> 00:06:06.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that a clean, 
white writing surface is restored.

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:12.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah further reassures us 
of the completeness of his forgiveness

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:17.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the words recorded at Psalm 103:12-14.

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:22.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah ‘remembers that we are dust’

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and does not expect perfection from us.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a merciful Father,

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:34.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
he puts our sins “as far off 
as the sunrise is from the sunset.”

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:40.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if a servant of Jehovah 
commits a serious sin,

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:45.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he is truly repentant with godly sadness,

00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:48.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
his sin can be blotted out,

00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:50.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely forgiven.

00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:55.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, it is essential for us to maintain

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reasonable, sensible,

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:01.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
realistic view of our imperfect state.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to make mistakes,

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:09.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we must have full trust in the reality

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s forgiveness based on the ransom.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:17.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, we can learn valuable lessons 
from our errors

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:20.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’ll be less likely to repeat them.

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:24.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need patience, though,

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
because some personality flaws and bad habits

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not go away overnight.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them may even be a lifelong battle.

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we may need counsel and discipline.

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:45.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should we realistically expect
when receiving discipline?

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:49.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 12:11-13

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes it clear 
that initially it will not “be joyous.”

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is painful”!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when we humbly accept discipline

00:08:01.364 --> 00:08:03.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and apply the counsel,

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be sure that we will gain inner peace

00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:09.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be a better servant of Jehovah.

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:14.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, do not give up,

00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:16.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
but keep making progress.

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never allow the Devil 
to convince you that you are a failure.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated in the September 1, 2001,

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
issue of <i> The Watchtower,</i>  on page 18:

00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:35.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Satan would like nothing better 
than to rob you of your peace . . . .

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:38.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He would surely like you 
to feel that your imperfection

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:41.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“makes your service unacceptable to God.

00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:45.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never allow the Devil to demoralize you!”

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:50.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our second question for consideration is,

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why must we be realistic

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we expect
from our brothers and sisters?

00:08:57.286 --> 00:09:01.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as it’s essential
to avoid having expectations

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are too high for ourselves,

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:08.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must also avoid expecting too much
from our brothers and sisters.

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:13.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such unreasonable expectations create stress,

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:16.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
disappointment, and frustration.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i> Awake!</i>  of September 8, 1994,

00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:23.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
quoted a factory supervisor who said:

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have to accept people as they are.

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you expect more than they can give,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you] will elevate the stress level,

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
making everyone unhappy.”

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should expect from our fellow workers

00:09:41.764 --> 00:09:44.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah and Jesus expect from them.

00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:48.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ illustration of the talents,

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:53.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded in Matthew chapter 25,
conveys their thinking.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
The main point of this illustration
is that the Master, Jesus,

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
expects each of his anointed brothers

00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:06.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the slaves and, by extension,
those who are of the other sheep—

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:10.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do his or her best

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the assigned work
of preaching the good news.

00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:16.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus distribute the work?

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:22.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 25:15 provides the answer:

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He gave five talents to one,

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“two to another,

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:31.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and one to still another,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to each according to his own ability,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he went abroad.”

00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:40.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are pleased with

00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will reward each of us

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:47.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we do our best
within our circumstances and ability.

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the slave with two talents 
gained two more,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
the master did not say to him,

00:10:54.103 --> 00:10:58.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why did you not gain five more 
like your fellow slave?’

00:10:58.474 --> 00:11:03.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave the two-talent slave
the same commendation

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:08.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the one who was given the five
and gained five more:

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well done, good and faithful slave!

00:11:12.722 --> 00:11:15.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You were faithful over a few things.

00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will appoint you over many things.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enter into the joy of your master.”

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:27.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two-talent slave
could be just as successful

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:31.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joyful as the five-talent slave.

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:36.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
They both met
their master’s reasonable expectations,

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:38.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their master was joyful too.

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:43.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a fine lesson for all of us,

00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
including those serving as elders!

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:49.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
In imitation of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:52.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should never put pressure on our brothers

00:11:52.328 --> 00:11:54.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do more than they’re capable of doing.

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:59.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Failure to take this reasonable
and realistic approach

00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:02.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
can result in much frustration.

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:08.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way that we show 
we have reasonable expectations

00:12:08.677 --> 00:12:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to acknowledge 
that from time to time disagreements

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hurt feelings
will arise among our brothers.

00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:18.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard someone say,

00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I expect to be treated that way
by the world, but not by my brother”?

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:26.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it reasonable to expect

00:12:26.128 --> 00:12:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there will not be any 
difficulties among brothers?

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jesus expect that at times

00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:37.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
his disciples will have difficulties 
among themselves?

00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:39.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:41.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say this?

00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember some of the expressions

00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used throughout
the Sermon on the Mount:

00:12:49.084 --> 00:12:53.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the peacemakers, 
since they will be called sons of God.”

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If . . . you are bringing 
your gift to the altar

00:12:57.993 --> 00:13:02.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and there you remember
that your brother has something against you,

00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:06.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“leave your gift there in front of the altar, 
and go away.

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:10.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“First make your peace with your brother,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then come back and offer your gift.”

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:17.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forgive us our debts,

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:21.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we also have forgiven our debtors.”

00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:26.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop judging that you may not be judged.”

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:31.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
These verses show
that Jesus knew his disciples

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:33.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have challenges among themselves.

00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:36.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a realistic expectation.

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:41.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s also reasonable 
to conclude that these problems

00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:46.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be successfully resolved 
if godly principles are applied.

00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:49.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then peace can be restored.

00:13:49.612 --> 00:13:52.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we should expect some tensions

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arise among the brotherhood today.

00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by applying Bible principles,

00:13:58.287 --> 00:14:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace can be restored and maintained.

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:05.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll now consider our third question:

00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:10.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it realistic to expect
that Jehovah will reward us

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:12.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our faithful sacred service?

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:16.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 11:6, 

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible tells us that Jehovah

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the rewarder 
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at 1 Corinthians 15:58,

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul encourages us

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have “plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:35.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that your labor is not in vain.”

00:14:36.926 --> 00:14:40.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was absolutely sure
of his heavenly reward.

00:14:41.497 --> 00:14:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite his sins 
prior to becoming a Christian

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:47.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his battles with sinful inclinations,

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
please note his confidence

00:14:49.872 --> 00:14:54.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed at 2 Timothy 4:7, 8:

00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:58.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have fought the fine fight,

00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:01.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have run the race to the finish,

00:15:01.383 --> 00:15:03.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have observed the faith.

00:15:03.852 --> 00:15:05.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From this time on,

00:15:05.588 --> 00:15:09.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there is reserved for me 
the crown of righteousness,

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:11.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which the Lord, the righteous judge,

00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:14.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will give me as a reward in that day,

00:15:14.863 --> 00:15:16.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet not to me only,

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:20.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to all those
who have loved his manifestation.”

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can have similar confidence
in the reward Jehovah has promised,

00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:29.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether our hope is heavenly

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to enjoy everlasting life 
on a paradise earth!

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:37.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a realistic expectation

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our reasonable and loving God
has promised it,

00:15:41.557 --> 00:15:43.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he does not lie.

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:47.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, may we develop

00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:51.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain
realistic expectations for ourselves

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for our fellow workers.

00:15:54.737 --> 00:15:57.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never lose sight of the reality

00:15:57.773 --> 00:16:01.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
will reward “those earnestly seeking him.”

00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:06.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have realistic expectations,

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can find joy and success
in our service to Jehovah now,

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:15.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as have the prospect
of doing so forever.
