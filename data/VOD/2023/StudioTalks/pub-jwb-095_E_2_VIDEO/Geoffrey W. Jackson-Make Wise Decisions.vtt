The theme of this month’s program

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.023 line:10% position:50% align:center
is “Make Wise Decisions.”

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:12.028 line:10% position:50% align:center
And our discussion is based on Job 34:11.

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together:

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he [Jehovah] will reward a man

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to what he does

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:25.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring upon him
the consequences of his ways.”

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
As highlighted in this scripture,

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:32.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
our actions are very important.

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our actions are usually the result

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
of decisions we make.

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:41.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some decisions are made
after a lot of serious thought.

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others, though, are made very quickly.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:48.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter how much thought
goes into making a decision,

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to recognize this basic fact:

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:57.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wise decisions bring positive rewards,

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wrong decisions can result
in very negative consequences.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, all of us
want to make wise decisions.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are wise decisions?

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:15.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wise decisions are those
that please our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:21.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us have already made
some very good decisions.

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
These include the big decisions in life,

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as dedicating ourselves to Jehovah

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and getting baptized

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:30.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deciding not to become involved

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:34.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the religious and political disputes
of this world.

00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:38.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt,
before we made those major decisions,

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
we spent a lot of time praying about them

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeking Jehovah’s direction.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve seen his blessing in our lives

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of these right decisions.

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:52.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this program, though,

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:56.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t be discussing such major decisions.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we’ll focus on decisions

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may be viewed by some as minor.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, some of these

00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:07.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to very serious consequences.

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll consider a Bible example

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:14.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a person who served Jehovah

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet made some wrong decisions
along the way.

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:21.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll analyze
what caused this faithful servant

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make these wrong decisions.

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we’ll consider what we need to do

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:31.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to make wise decisions.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, we’ll consider what we need to do

00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:37.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we realize we’ve already made
an unwise decision.

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:43.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to start, let’s discuss
a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made some unwise decisions.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
The example we have in mind

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:51.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that of King Jehoshaphat.

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jehovah’s view
of King Jehoshaphat?

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see the answer

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:01.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Chronicles chapter 17

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 3 and 4:

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah continued with Jehoshaphat

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:12.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because he walked
in the former ways of his forefather David

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and did not search for the Baals.

00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he searched for the God of his father

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and followed his commandment

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the practices of Israel.”

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds like a wonderful commendation,
doesn’t it?

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehoshaphat was a faithful king.

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made the wise decision
to worship Jehovah.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even so,

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still made
some very unwise decisions.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read
about one of those unwise decisions

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:50.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Chronicles 18:1:

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehoshaphat had riches
and glory in abundance,

00:03:56.753 --> 00:04:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.”

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:06.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he made his son
marry Ahab’s daughter Athaliah.

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was a very unwise decision.

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:14.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Ahab had built a temple for Baal

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:19.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had even employed 850 false prophets.

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahab was also married
to wicked Queen Jezebel.

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would want their child
to marry into such a bad family?

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:32.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Jehoshaphat thinking?

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:36.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did he arrange for this marriage?

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:39.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps he wanted to reunite the 12 tribes,

00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:43.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
or he may have had some political
and commercial motives

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
for wanting to have Ahab as an ally.

00:04:46.502 --> 00:04:49.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we don’t know
for sure the reason,

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do know there were consequences.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this close relationship with Ahab,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat felt obligated to support Ahab

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:03.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a war against the Syrians.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, this led
to yet another unwise decision.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
As they were preparing for this battle,

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:16.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat asked for direction
from one of Jehovah’s prophets.

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:20.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahab, though, expressed
his hatred for the prophet

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, after hearing the prophet’s message,

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
had him thrown into prison.

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:30.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point,
it was decision time for Jehoshaphat.

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:34.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he decide to do?

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although he initially disagreed with Ahab,

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
he eventually joined him in the battle.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:45.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat disregarded
the warning from Jehovah.

00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:50.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then this led him
to still another unwise decision

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:54.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this time an incredibly foolish decision.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s prophet had foretold

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Israelites would lose
their shepherd, or king, in battle.

00:06:03.312 --> 00:06:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Ahab said that he would disguise himself

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not enter the battle dressed as a king.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then said that Jehoshaphat
should still dress like a king.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just think about that for a moment.

00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:22.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahab was basically saying,

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You go out into battle
with a target on your back,

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ll hide in disguise.’

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat’s decision to agree to do that

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not only unwise but also foolish.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
It nearly cost him his life.

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why would he do that? 

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:44.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i>  says

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps Jehoshaphat
didn’t want “to go back

00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his original promise to accompany Ahab.”

00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:53.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
So maybe he would have lost face

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he backed out
of the agreement at that point.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Jehoshaphat did survive the battle,

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sent another prophet to him

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:07.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say what’s recorded at 2 Chronicles 19:2:

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is it the wicked you should be helping,

00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:15.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and is it those
who hate Jehovah you should love?

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:20.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this the indignation
of Jehovah is against you.”

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:23.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Jehovah acknowledged

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good things
that Jehoshaphat had accomplished

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
in other aspects of his life,

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:33.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat clearly made
some very unwise decisions.

00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:37.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons do we learn
from Jehoshaphat’s wrong decisions?

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 1:

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:44.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because we’ve done
many good things in Jehovah’s service

00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t mean
that we’ll always make wise decisions.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:51.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 2:

00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making friendships with those
who hate Jehovah

00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
can put us under pressure
to make other unwise decisions.

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:01.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 3:

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:05.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though
we may seek Jehovah’s direction,

00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:09.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must follow it
if we want to make wise decisions.

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:12.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 4:

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:16.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we realize
that we’ve made an unwise decision,

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t keep going in the same course.

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stop and change direction.

00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
These lessons can be summarized

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:28.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the words of Proverbs 22:3.

00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:30.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re told:

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:35.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself,

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the inexperienced keep right on going

00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:40.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suffer the consequences.”

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to see
the possible consequences of wrong decisions

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take action to avoid them.

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:52.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the consequences

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehoshaphat’s unwise decisions?

00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:58.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
It nearly cost him his life.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
His oldest son died an apostate.

00:09:01.757 --> 00:09:04.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later, his daughter-in-law Athaliah

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
killed all the heirs to the throne
except one baby

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:11.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and set herself up as queen of Judah.

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you might be thinking,

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Still, Jehovah viewed Jehoshaphat
as a good king.’

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he did.

00:09:21.077 --> 00:09:23.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s encouraging for us to know

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even if we have made
some unwise decisions,

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s possible that Jehovah
may still view us as his faithful servants.

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:37.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean, then,
that our decisions are not so important? 

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> back in 1980

00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
made this interesting comparison.

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:48.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
It used an illustration of two ship captains.

00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
One skillfully maneuvered his ship
through a storm,

00:09:51.807 --> 00:09:55.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing the vessel
and his crew safely to shore.

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:59.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the other captain made unwise decisions,

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:04.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of that,
he experienced shipwreck

00:10:04.654 --> 00:10:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the same storm, saving only his life.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
While both captains escaped with their lives,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one whose ship remained intact

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
would certainly enjoy
greater happiness and honor, wouldn’t he?

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:22.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s obvious
which captain Jehoshaphat was like.

00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:25.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike Jehoshaphat,

00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
surely we’d prefer
to be like the successful captain

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:32.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the one whose ship remained intact.

00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we make sure
that we are like the successful captain?

00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 2011, the April <i>Watchtower</i>

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:48.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a special chart
entitled “Steps to Making Good Decisions.”

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:53.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
It listed these steps
in making wise decisions:

00:10:54.537 --> 00:10:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Avoid being presumptuous.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Do research.

00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:05.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Pray for wisdom.

00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) Make the decision.

00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:10.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
(5) Implement the decision.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then there was an additional step:

00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:16.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
(6) Review and adjust.

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:20.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is step 6 listed?

00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:22.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, from time to time,

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to review decisions
we’ve already made.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do so, perhaps we’ll come to realize

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:34.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some of them
were not the best decisions.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:38.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you still be like the successful captain?

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:39.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you can!

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:40.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you courageously make
the needed adjustments.

00:11:45.654 --> 00:11:48.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must acknowledge that not all decisions

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
work out exactly as we had planned.

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Ecclesiastes 9:11 reminds us,

00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:58.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“time and unexpected events
overtake [us] all.”

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should we do if that’s the case?

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:06.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same <i>Watchtower </i> of 2011

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:09.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
answers that question for us.

00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:13.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
After saying that Jehovah expects us
to live up to such decisions

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:17.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our dedication and our marriage vows,

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
it went on to say:

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:23.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Most decisions, though, are less weighty.

00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:26.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A wise person will from time to time

00:12:26.462 --> 00:12:29.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“review the decisions he has made.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will not let pride or stubbornness

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“prevent him from adjusting

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or even reversing a decision.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His prime concern is to make sure

00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:43.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his life course continues to honor God.”

00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:48.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking back
to the illustration of the two captains,

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:52.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
at times they may need
to reverse a former unwise decision.

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:59.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
That happened
during a hurricane back in 1889.

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:03.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
The captain of the British ship <i>Calliope</i>

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:08.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
was anchored in the harbor
in Apia, Western Samoa,

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:11.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a hurricane started blowing.

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:15.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initially, he decided,
like all the other captains in the harbor,

00:13:15.277 --> 00:13:18.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
to weather the storm where he was.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as the waves grew in height
and the dangers increased,

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
the captain realized
he had made the wrong decision.

00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he do?

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
He courageously reversed his decision

00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
and headed out to open sea.

00:13:35.097 --> 00:13:37.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was difficult, but ultimately 

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saved himself,

00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:44.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
his ship, and the 250 sailors on board.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
This bold act of courage
entered him into the annals of naval history.

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:53.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be like that courageous captain,

00:13:53.983 --> 00:13:58.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
at times we need
to prayerfully reexamine our past decisions.

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
These could be decisions
about our employment,

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:06.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
entertainment, education,
or even where we live.

00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:10.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we made the original decisions,

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may have seemed wise to us.

00:14:13.068 --> 00:14:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do they still seem that way now?

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:20.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we see the dangerous winds
of bad consequences

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the frightening
waves of disaster approaching

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:28.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our decisions were not
completely in harmony with Jehovah’s will,

00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:30.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should we do?

00:14:30.486 --> 00:14:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be like the wise captain.

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:35.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry about losing face.

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be courageous!

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray for Jehovah’s help,
and then take bold action.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make the changes you need to make

00:14:43.332 --> 00:14:46.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to continue to please Jehovah.

00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:50.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, you’ll make the wise decision

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:52.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the one that leads to success,

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:55.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one that Jehovah will bless.
