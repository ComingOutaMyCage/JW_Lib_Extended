The evening before he died,

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus Christ asked his Father in prayer

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to watch over his disciples.

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:15.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
His request is recorded at John 17:15-17.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read it with me.

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “I do not request

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you take them out of the world,

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that you watch over them

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of the wicked one.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are no part of the world,

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as I am no part of the world.”

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ confidence in Jehovah

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the power of the truth

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:45.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be seen clearly
in what he asks of his Father in verse 17:

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sanctify them by means of the truth;

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
your word is truth.”

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we accept the truth

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make a personal dedication to God,

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a general sense,

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are sanctified,
or set apart, from the world

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we no longer fit into its mold.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
People view us differently

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our values have changed.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live by the standards of Bible truth,

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and doing so honors Jehovah God,

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives our life meaning,
and brings us great happiness.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
With those thoughts in mind,

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
how should we feel about the sayings of God

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible truths that we have learned?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel the way the psalmist did.

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 119:140,

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said to Jehovah God:

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your saying is thoroughly refined

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[which means that it’s clean and pure;

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he said],
and your servant loves it.”

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that how we feel about the truth?

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love it!

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be wonderful if everyone
would respond to the truth of God’s Word

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love it.

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the sad fact is
that the majority of the world rejects it.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many people
who do not believe that truth is attainable.

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some ancient philosophers
made the teaching of doubts

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:29.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
virtually their life’s work.

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Human philosophy
is built on pride of intellect

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a warped pleasure of endless speculation

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
that leaves Jehovah God, the Creator,

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely out of the picture.

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
By removing God,

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
philosophers wander
in a maze of ideas and theories

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:55.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fascinate the mind and inflate the ego

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never arrive at the truth.

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:03.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
If truth were not attainable,

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would Jesus Christ say

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at John 8:31, 32:

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you remain in my word,

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you are really my disciples,

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will know the truth,

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truth will set you free”?

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we not experiencing
the freedom that Jesus spoke of?

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why would the apostle Paul write
at 1 Timothy 2:4

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s “will is that all sorts of people

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be saved
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth”?

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does the word “truth” occur
over a hundred times

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Christian Greek Scriptures?

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:51.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus not only pointed out
that the truth is attainable,

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he showed that finding it is required

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
if our worship is to be approved by God.

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a Samaritan woman wondered

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the true form of worship was

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:08.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the worship practiced
by the Jews in Jerusalem

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that practiced
by the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim—

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not answer by saying:

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Truth is unattainable,
and you don’t need to worry about it,’

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ‘You can believe
whatever you want to believe.’

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jesus did not view the truth as relative

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that whatever you want to believe
is the truth.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is nonsense

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has nothing to do
with the realities of life.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:42.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 4:23, 24,

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus made a specific reference to truth,

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:50.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit, and pure worship.

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 4:23, 24, he said:

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:56.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“True worshippers

00:04:56.525 --> 00:05:00.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will worship the Father
with spirit and truth,

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:04.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for indeed, the Father is looking
for ones like these

00:05:04.032 --> 00:05:05.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to worship him.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him

00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:14.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
must worship with spirit and truth.”

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:18.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was talking about
being guided in our worship

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
by God’s holy spirit

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:24.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said that we do not need
the use of temples, images,

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:28.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other physical objects in true worship.

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:30.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the truth that Jesus referred to

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:34.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an accurate knowledge of Bible truths.

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:40.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
True faith is much more
than just belief in God

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:42.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that he exists;

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:45.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
it also means an acceptance of God’s Word,

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:49.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
obtaining an intellectual understanding
of that Word,

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:53.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then manifesting
a heartfelt reliance upon it.

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
As genuine Christians,

00:05:57.085 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
we view the Bible
as the inspired Word of God,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
beneficial for teaching
and disciplining mankind.

00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:10.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 119:160 says of Jehovah God:

00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The very essence of your word is truth.”

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus Christ stood before Pontius Pilate

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:24.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told him that he had come to earth
to speak the truth,

00:06:25.113 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate responded with the words:
“What is truth?”

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:32.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely, Pilate was cynical.

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words reveal a skeptical view of truth.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:42.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the truth that Jesus had in mind
was about God’s Kingdom

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:45.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus’ role as its King.

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:48.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the very theme, the core,

00:06:48.178 --> 00:06:52.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ teaching while he was on earth.

00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:55.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why when Pilate asked Jesus
if he was a king,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus replied:

00:06:57.604 --> 00:06:59.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You yourself say it.”

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:03.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, ‘Yes, I am,’

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:07.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he added that his Kingdom
was “no part of this world.”

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:13.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is that his Kingdom
will sanctify Jehovah’s name,

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:15.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
vindicate his sovereignty,

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restore faithful mankind
to happy, eternal life.

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:25.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine Christians embrace this truth.

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:32.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jesus’ role in the fulfillment
of all of God’s promises is so pivotal 

00:07:32.514 --> 00:07:35.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and since all of God’s prophecies

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:38.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
become “Amen,” or true, because of him,

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:42.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus could well say,
as recorded at John 14:6:

00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:48.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am the way and the truth and the life.”

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:52.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as 2 Corinthians 1:20 declares:

00:07:52.284 --> 00:07:55.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For no matter how many
the promises of God are,

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:59.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they have become ‘yes’ by means of him.

00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, also through him

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the ‘Amen’ said to God.”

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:08.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used the word “amen”

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:12.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
to affirm the truthfulness of what was said,

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:16.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he did so in a unique way.

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
We usually say “amen” after a prayer is said

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:22.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show our agreement with it.

00:08:22.314 --> 00:08:24.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, rather than use it

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reply to a prayer or a statement,

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:29.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
he used “amen”

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:33.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
to introduce pronouncements of truth.

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, he repeated the word,

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:39.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying “amen, amen”
and then made his statement,

00:08:39.956 --> 00:08:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
which would be like saying

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“most truly I say to you.”

00:08:45.587 --> 00:08:48.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, by using this expression,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:53.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
he assured his listeners
that his words were the absolute truth.

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:57.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus could speak with such certainty

00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:00.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was the one authorized

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make all of God’s promises come true.

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:08.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
To us, the exhilarating
good news of God’s Kingdom

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:11.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the rulership of Jesus Christ

00:09:11.446 --> 00:09:16.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more, far more, than mere information.

00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:18.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
That truth moves us to action;

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:23.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
it compels us to live by it
and share it with others.

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:27.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the first-century Christian congregation,

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:31.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way of life they adopted
as followers of Christ

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:35.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
was sometimes known simply as “the truth”

00:09:35.053 --> 00:09:38.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “the way of the truth.”

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:42.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me 3 John verse 4, where it says:

00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:47.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No greater joy do I have than this:

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:49.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should hear that my children

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:52.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
go on walking in the truth.”

00:09:53.697 --> 00:09:56.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that how parents feel
about their children

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:59.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are serving Jehovah faithfully?

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:01.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, not all young ones

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:09.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
raised in a believing household
have stuck with the truth.

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:13.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true about many
with whom we’ve studied the Bible.

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:16.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is their situation hopeless?

00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:18.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:10:18.805 --> 00:10:21.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s still time for them to act

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to show Jehovah that they love him

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:28.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they love the truth.

00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:32.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The end of this system is fast approaching.

00:10:32.194 --> 00:10:36.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is going to happen and soon.

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:39.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage such ones
to give serious thought

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:42.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their relationship with Jehovah God,

00:10:42.662 --> 00:10:45.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he genuinely loves them

00:10:45.874 --> 00:10:48.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wants them to have life.

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:52.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray that such ones
take whatever steps are necessary

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:56.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
to return to Jehovah before it’s too late.

00:10:57.761 --> 00:10:59.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a Scriptural fact

00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:04.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people need to love the truth
in order to be saved.

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:07.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the point that the apostle Paul makes

00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:10.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Thessalonians 2:10,

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it reads in part
that people will perish

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:19.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they did not accept
the love of the truth

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:22.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order that they might be saved.”

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:27.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our prayer is
that honesthearted people everywhere

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:29.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
will respond to Jehovah’s invitation

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:33.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
to draw close to him and love the truth.

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:38.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world is heading for an abrupt end

00:11:38.343 --> 00:11:41.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the battle of Armageddon.

00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:43.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
To survive that battle,

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:46.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must have knowledge of Jehovah God

00:11:46.184 --> 00:11:48.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and live in harmony with his Word,

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:52.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
which includes the teachings of Jesus Christ.

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:57.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earth wide we are proclaiming the good news

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s Kingdom
has been established in the heavens.

00:12:00.782 --> 00:12:02.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
That proclamation

00:12:02.784 --> 00:12:06.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the foretold “witness to all the nations”

00:12:06.538 --> 00:12:11.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
that soon the accomplished end
of this world’s system will come.

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:14.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, not the end of our planet,

00:12:14.838 --> 00:12:19.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
because another basic truth
is that “the earth remains forever”

00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:23.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
as stated at Ecclesiastes 1:4.

00:12:23.763 --> 00:12:28.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are absolute truths that we preach,

00:12:28.393 --> 00:12:30.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love them.

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:35.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing the truth sets us free from lies,

00:12:35.483 --> 00:12:38.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
delusions, and superstitions.

00:12:38.445 --> 00:12:40.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we live by it,

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:44.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
the truth strengthens us to endure hardships.

00:12:44.242 --> 00:12:48.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s truth is so reliable and well-founded,

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:51.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it so inspires us with hope

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:55.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it enables us
to stand up under any test.

00:12:56.087 --> 00:13:00.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see our brothers in lands
where they are mistreated and persecuted

00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:05.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing just that,
and they do it with joy.

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:10.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
To dismiss truth as relative or nonexistent

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:13.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to miss out on the most thrilling

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:17.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fulfilling quest that life offers.

00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:21.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find the truth is to find hope;

00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:26.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know and love it is to know and love
the Creator of the universe

00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:29.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his only-begotten Son;

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:34.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live by it is to live with purpose
and peace of mind,

00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:37.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
now and forever.
