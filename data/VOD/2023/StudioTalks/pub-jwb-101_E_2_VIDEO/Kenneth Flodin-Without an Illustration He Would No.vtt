00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:05.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
How important is the use of illustrations?

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.779 line:10% position:50% align:center
Are they simply fluff in our teaching?

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.282 line:10% position:50% align:center
One definition of the English word “fluff”

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.033 line:10% position:50% align:center
is this:

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“something essentially trivial

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lacking importance or solid worth.”

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are illustrations trivial
and of little worth?

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along on-screen

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I read our theme scripture,

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 13:34:

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by illustrations.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, without an illustration

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would not speak to them.”

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often call Jesus the Great Teacher.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Illustrations were essential

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fully grasp what was being taught.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we won’t be spending a lot of time

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the dos and don’ts of using illustrations.

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i>
has a whole topic on “Illustrations.”

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Apply Yourself </i>
<i>to Reading and Teaching</i>  brochure

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
has some helpful suggestions in lesson 8.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me remind you, also,

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a talk that Brother Splane
of the Governing Body gave

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the 2020 regional convention.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title was “Improve Your Skills
—Illustrating Key Points.”

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had some very practical suggestions,
which I won’t be repeating here,

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
so perhaps you’ll want
to review Brother Splane’s talk

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an upcoming family worship.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the Bible
actually identifies Jesus’ expression

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:44.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an illustration;

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of the time,
it does not.

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:50.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just part of the way
he spoke naturally;

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrations flowed from him.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did he come up with them
so readily?

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was observant
of what was happening around him.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:05.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
We too can be observant.

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help to train us
to think in illustrations.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bread and the wine used
at the Memorial of Christ’s death

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautifully represented
Jesus’ perfect body and blood

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:20.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be given
in behalf of sinful mankind.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can learn something
about our use of illustrations

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
by considering the circumstances
of the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:31.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it:

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
From years of attending,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew what was going to be
on the Passover table that night.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he could’ve thought in advance

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
of using those emblems in that way.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know for sure.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:52.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a simple, logical,
and indelible impression it made that night

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:55.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continues to make on millions of us

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 2,000 years later!

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re going to give
a talk or demonstration

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
at one of our meetings,
we already know the topic.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have the luxury of thinking
of an illustration in advance.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we’re teaching a Bible student

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he asks us an unexpected question?

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment,
you’ll likely mentally consider your student

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what you know about his work, his hobbies,

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just his daily life experiences—

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an illustration may come to your mind
on the spur of the moment.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:37.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s see how that latter process
(an unexpected situation)

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
was faced by Jesus.

00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case,
we can understand his thought process

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
in coming up with masterful illustrations.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
John chapter 4 is the account
about the Samaritan woman at the well.

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:58.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 4:34,
Jesus used the illustration of food.

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said there:

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My food is to do the will of him who sent me

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to finish his work.”

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a simple, effective illustration.

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:16.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why might he have used
the generic expression “food”

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of something more specific

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
like “my wine” or “my bread
is to do the will of him who sent me”?

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at the context.

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:30.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, in quick succession,

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:33.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used two different illustrations.

00:04:33.043 --> 00:04:36.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in both cases,
it seems from the context

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he came up with these
based on what was happening at the time.

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:44.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 4:7 says:

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:48.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:51.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to her: ‘Give me a drink.’”

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:56.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s setup number one
for an illustration about water.

00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:01.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For his disciples had gone off

00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:04.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the city to buy food.”

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:09.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s setup number two
for an illustration about food.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus didn’t orchestrate all of this
in advance.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just circumstantial

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:19.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus asked a woman
who approached with a water jar

00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:21.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give him a drink.

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus instantly thought of and used

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
the subject of water as an illustration.

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10 says:

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you had known of the free gift of God

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:37.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who it is who says to you,

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Give me a drink,’

00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:41.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you would have asked him,

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:44.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would have given you living water.”

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:48.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
The illustration was spontaneous.

00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:52.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
It effectively led
to a fine witness about Jesus.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in illustration number two,
look in verse 27.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is still talking to the woman
when the disciples return from the city.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember that verse 8 said

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:10.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
the disciples had gone
“into the city to buy food”?

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they come back,
and they have some food for Jesus.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Going to verse 28, the woman leaves.

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the disciples now say to Jesus,

00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:25.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a setup for illustration number two

00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:30.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not water, but food now becomes
the topic of conversation.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 31:

00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him:

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Rabbi, eat.’”

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:42.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “eat” caused Jesus
to think of the now famous illustration

00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:45.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we quote regularly.

00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:47.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 32:

00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:49.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he said to them:

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have food to eat

00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:53.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you do not know about.’”

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the disciples are puzzled.

00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 33:

00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:00.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples said to one another:

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No one brought him anything to eat, did he?’

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:08.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus [picking up on the topic at hand]
said to them:

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:12.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My food
is to do the will of him who sent me

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:14.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to finish his work.’”

00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now obviously,
Jesus did not choreograph

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:19.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
all this in advance.

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:22.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But based on the circumstances at hand,

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:25.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
he came up with illustrations that worked.

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:28.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in what way?

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:33.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point of similarity
between God’s will and food?

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eating good food is enjoyable.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s satisfying!

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point?

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:42.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus enjoyed doing God’s will.

00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:45.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was satisfying to him
—like eating a tasty meal.

00:07:47.154 --> 00:07:52.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another point of similarity
is that food invigorates a person.

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:54.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was invigorated

00:07:54.536 --> 00:07:57.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
by that conversation
with the Samaritan woman.

00:07:58.498 --> 00:08:02.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now glance back up in verses 3-6.

00:08:02.127 --> 00:08:05.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that Jesus had “left Judea” on foot.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 6:

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:09.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Jesus,

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:12.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tired out as he was from the journey,

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:14.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was sitting at the well.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about the sixth hour.”

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:20.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
after witnessing to the woman at the well,

00:08:20.604 --> 00:08:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is invigorated.

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even alluded to the idea

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the experience
was more energizing than literal food.

00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned thus far
from the process?

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you know beforehand
what will be discussed,

00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:43.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gives you the opportunity
to think of an appropriate illustration

00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:45.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
in advance.

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:48.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
If something comes up unexpectedly,

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
often you can use
what you’ve observed around you

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:55.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what you already know
to generate an effective illustration.

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might be thinking:
‘Uh, I’m not really creative.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It takes a while
for me to think up an illustration,

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:09.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘even when I know in advance
that I have an assignment at the meeting.

00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:12.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘On-the-spot illustrations?

00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:14.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s probably not going to happen for me

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:18.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the way my brain works
or doesn’t work.’

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:22.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a way to train the brain

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:25.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think in illustration mode?

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:26.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:27.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:31.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is by observing creation

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:34.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
or man-made inventions,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when you don’t have a talk to give

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:39.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even when your children
are not with you.

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what you observe,

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:44.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reason out how it could be applied

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a teaching lesson in the future.

00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:50.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Write it down if you need to
so as to remember it.

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:56.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father told me that even when
his children were not with him,

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:58.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would look at creation

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:01.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come up with a line of reasoning

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:03.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might be helpful in the future.

00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:05.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave an example.

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:09.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
He observed two kittens playing together.

00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:11.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reasoned:

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:13.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do those kittens look happy?

00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:15.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes.

00:10:15.594 --> 00:10:17.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If Jehovah knows what it takes

00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:19.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make two kittens happy,

00:10:19.764 --> 00:10:21.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do you think he knows

00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:24.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
what it would take to make you happy?”

00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:27.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously, a child would agree.

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:32.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So if Jehovah knows what it would take
to make you happy,

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:36.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should you do if Jehovah says
to do something a certain way?”

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Profound, Dad!

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:42.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it Jehovah’s way
if you want to be happy.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the beautiful reality,
the golden moment,

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
was when he saw one of his sons

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:52.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
watching two squirrels
in a tree chasing each other.

00:10:53.673 --> 00:10:56.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used the squirrels as his illustration,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the prepared line of reasoning.

00:11:00.347 --> 00:11:05.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now his son still remembers that point
many decades later.

00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:11.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ brain thought creatively
when using illustrations.

00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:17.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
For another example,
please turn with me to John 1:42.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus changed Simon’s name on the spot.

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:25.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 1:42:

00:11:25.872 --> 00:11:30.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he [Andrew] led him [Simon] to Jesus.

00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:34.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jesus looked at him, he said:

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:36.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You are Simon, the son of John;

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:39.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will be called Cephas’

00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:41.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which is translated ‘Peter’).”

00:11:42.514 --> 00:11:46.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why did Jesus change his name
to Cephas, or Peter?

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:51.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
It actually seems to be creative thinking.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word for Peter is <i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tros,</i>
not <i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tra.</i>

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tra</i>  means “Rock Mass,”

00:11:59.239 --> 00:12:01.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that applies to Jesus, the cornerstone,

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:04.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
the head of the Christian congregation.

00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:08.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, <i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tros</i>  means “A Piece of Rock.”

00:12:08.832 --> 00:12:11.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful description of Peter!

00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:16.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, Peter didn’t seem to be dependable.

00:12:16.006 --> 00:12:18.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus saw good qualities in him

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave him the name Peter
(<i>Pe</i><i>ˈ</i><i>tros,</i> Piece of Rock).

00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:26.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect,

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:30.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was saying
that he would become as stable as a rock.

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:33.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s precisely what transpired.

00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:35.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great word picture,

00:12:35.066 --> 00:12:37.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
or illustration, by Jesus!

00:12:38.653 --> 00:12:40.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 1:1,

00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:42.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
under inspiration to John,

00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:45.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said that that book of the Bible was

00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:50.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a revelation by Jesus Christ,
which God gave him.”

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Insight</i>  book says:

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The book of Revelation
concludes the Holy Scriptures

00:12:57.339 --> 00:13:00.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with one
of the most outstanding concentrations

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:04.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
of illustrations found in the entire Bible.”

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
You recall our theme is from Matthew 13:34:

00:13:09.643 --> 00:13:13.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Without an Illustration
He Would Not Speak to Them.”

00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:18.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
As another example,
Jesus gave his famous Sermon on the Mount.

00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:22.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Matthew chapter 7,
the last chapter of that sermon,

00:13:22.489 --> 00:13:26.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
he used at least ten different illustrations.

00:13:26.993 --> 00:13:31.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, “without an illustration
he would not speak to them.”

00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:36.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 7:28
sums up the Sermon on the Mount, saying:

00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:40.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jesus finished these sayings,

00:13:40.048 --> 00:13:43.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the effect was that the crowds were astounded

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:45.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
at his way of teaching.”

00:13:45.845 --> 00:13:49.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:21 says that Jesus left

00:13:49.182 --> 00:13:53.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a model for [us]
to follow his steps closely.”

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:56.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes his art of teaching,

00:13:56.147 --> 00:14:00.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
which incorporated
extensive use of illustrations.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were pithy and to the point.

00:14:03.446 --> 00:14:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
May each of us train ourselves
to think that way

00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strive to improve our teaching skills

00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:12.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of illustrations.
