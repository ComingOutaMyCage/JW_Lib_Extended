00:00:02 How important is the use of illustrations?
00:00:05 Are they simply fluff in our teaching?
00:00:08 One definition of the English word “fluff”
00:00:11 is this:
00:00:13 “something essentially trivial
00:00:15 and lacking importance or solid worth.”
00:00:19 Are illustrations trivial and of little worth?
00:00:24 Please follow along on-screen
00:00:26 as I read our theme scripture,
00:00:29 Matthew 13:34:
00:00:32 “All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds
00:00:35 “by illustrations.
00:00:37 “Indeed, without an illustration
00:00:39 he would not speak to them.”
00:00:43 We often call Jesus the Great Teacher.
00:00:46 Illustrations were essential
00:00:49 to fully grasp what was being taught.
00:00:52 Now, we won’t be spending a lot of time
00:00:54 on the dos and don’ts of using illustrations.
00:00:58 Insight on the Scriptures has a whole topic on “Illustrations.”
00:01:03 And the Apply Yourself  to Reading and Teaching  brochure
00:01:07 has some helpful suggestions in lesson 8.
00:01:11 Let me remind you, also,
00:01:14 of a talk that Brother Splane of the Governing Body gave
00:01:17 at the 2020 regional convention.
00:01:20 The title was “Improve Your Skills —Illustrating Key Points.”
00:01:26 It had some very practical suggestions, which I won’t be repeating here,
00:01:30 so perhaps you’ll want to review Brother Splane’s talk
00:01:34 in an upcoming family worship.
00:01:38 At times, the Bible actually identifies Jesus’ expression
00:01:42 as an illustration;
00:01:44 most of the time, it does not.
00:01:47 It was just part of the way he spoke naturally;
00:01:50 illustrations flowed from him.
00:01:54 Well, how did he come up with them so readily?
00:01:57 Jesus was observant of what was happening around him.
00:02:03 We too can be observant.
00:02:05 This will help to train us to think in illustrations.
00:02:10 The bread and the wine used at the Memorial of Christ’s death
00:02:13 beautifully represented Jesus’ perfect body and blood
00:02:16 that would be given in behalf of sinful mankind.
00:02:21 But we can learn something about our use of illustrations
00:02:25 by considering the circumstances of the Lord’s Evening Meal.
00:02:29 Think about it:
00:02:31 From years of attending,
00:02:33 Jesus knew what was going to be on the Passover table that night.
00:02:38 So he could’ve thought in advance
00:02:41 of using those emblems in that way.
00:02:44 We don’t know for sure.
00:02:47 But what a simple, logical, and indelible impression it made that night
00:02:52 and continues to make on millions of us
00:02:55 some 2,000 years later!
00:02:58 If we’re going to give a talk or demonstration
00:03:01 at one of our meetings, we already know the topic.
00:03:04 So we have the luxury of thinking of an illustration in advance.
00:03:10 But what if we’re teaching a Bible student
00:03:13 and he asks us an unexpected question?
00:03:17 At that moment, you’ll likely mentally consider your student
00:03:21 —what you know about his work, his hobbies,
00:03:24 or just his daily life experiences—
00:03:27 and an illustration may come to your mind on the spur of the moment.
00:03:33 Well, let’s see how that latter process (an unexpected situation)
00:03:37 was faced by Jesus.
00:03:40 In this case, we can understand his thought process
00:03:44 in coming up with masterful illustrations.
00:03:49 John chapter 4 is the account about the Samaritan woman at the well.
00:03:54 At John 4:34, Jesus used the illustration of food.
00:03:58 He said there:
00:04:00 “My food is to do the will of him who sent me
00:04:04 and to finish his work.”
00:04:07 That’s a simple, effective illustration.
00:04:11 Why might he have used the generic expression “food”
00:04:16 instead of something more specific
00:04:18 like “my wine” or “my bread is to do the will of him who sent me”?
00:04:24 Well, let’s look at the context.
00:04:27 Interestingly, in quick succession,
00:04:30 Jesus used two different illustrations.
00:04:33 And in both cases, it seems from the context
00:04:36 that he came up with these based on what was happening at the time.
00:04:41 John 4:7 says:
00:04:44 “A woman of Samaria came to draw water.
00:04:48 Jesus said to her: ‘Give me a drink.’”
00:04:52 Well, that’s setup number one for an illustration about water.
00:04:57 Verse 8 says:
00:04:59 “For his disciples had gone off
00:05:01 into the city to buy food.”
00:05:04 That’s setup number two for an illustration about food.
00:05:10 Now, Jesus didn’t orchestrate all of this in advance.
00:05:13 It was just circumstantial
00:05:15 that Jesus asked a woman who approached with a water jar
00:05:19 to give him a drink.
00:05:22 But Jesus instantly thought of and used
00:05:25 the subject of water as an illustration.
00:05:29 Verse 10 says:
00:05:31 “If you had known of the free gift of God
00:05:35 “and who it is who says to you,
00:05:37 “‘Give me a drink,’
00:05:39 “you would have asked him,
00:05:41 and he would have given you living water.”
00:05:45 The illustration was spontaneous.
00:05:48 It effectively led to a fine witness about Jesus.
00:05:53 Now, in illustration number two, look in verse 27.
00:05:57 Jesus is still talking to the woman when the disciples return from the city.
00:06:03 Do you remember that verse 8 said
00:06:06 the disciples had gone “into the city to buy food”?
00:06:10 So they come back, and they have some food for Jesus.
00:06:15 Going to verse 28, the woman leaves.
00:06:18 Notice what the disciples now say to Jesus,
00:06:21 which is a setup for illustration number two
00:06:25 —not water, but food now becomes the topic of conversation.
00:06:31 Verse 31:
00:06:32 “Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him:
00:06:36 ‘Rabbi, eat.’”
00:06:38 The word “eat” caused Jesus to think of the now famous illustration
00:06:42 that we quote regularly.
00:06:45 Verse 32:
00:06:47 “But he said to them:
00:06:49 “‘I have food to eat
00:06:51 that you do not know about.’”
00:06:53 Well, the disciples are puzzled.
00:06:56 Verse 33:
00:06:57 “So the disciples said to one another:
00:07:00 “‘No one brought him anything to eat, did he?’
00:07:04 “Jesus [picking up on the topic at hand] said to them:
00:07:08 “‘My food is to do the will of him who sent me
00:07:12 and to finish his work.’”
00:07:14 Now obviously, Jesus did not choreograph
00:07:17 all this in advance.
00:07:19 But based on the circumstances at hand,
00:07:22 he came up with illustrations that worked.
00:07:26 Well, in what way?
00:07:28 Well, what’s the point of similarity between God’s will and food?
00:07:34 Eating good food is enjoyable.
00:07:36 It’s satisfying!
00:07:38 The point?
00:07:39 Jesus enjoyed doing God’s will.
00:07:42 It was satisfying to him —like eating a tasty meal.
00:07:47 Another point of similarity is that food invigorates a person.
00:07:52 Jesus was invigorated
00:07:54 by that conversation with the Samaritan woman.
00:07:58 Now glance back up in verses 3-6.
00:08:02 It says that Jesus had “left Judea” on foot.
00:08:05 Look in verse 6:
00:08:07 “Now Jesus,
00:08:09 “tired out as he was from the journey,
00:08:12 “was sitting at the well.
00:08:14 It was about the sixth hour.”
00:08:17 However, after witnessing to the woman at the well,
00:08:20 Jesus is invigorated.
00:08:22 He even alluded to the idea
00:08:25 that the experience was more energizing than literal food.
00:08:30 What have we learned thus far from the process?
00:08:34 If you know beforehand what will be discussed,
00:08:39 that gives you the opportunity to think of an appropriate illustration
00:08:43 in advance.
00:08:45 If something comes up unexpectedly,
00:08:48 often you can use what you’ve observed around you
00:08:51 or what you already know to generate an effective illustration.
00:08:57 You might be thinking: ‘Uh, I’m not really creative.
00:09:01 ‘It takes a while for me to think up an illustration,
00:09:05 ‘even when I know in advance that I have an assignment at the meeting.
00:09:10 ‘On-the-spot illustrations?
00:09:12 ‘It’s probably not going to happen for me
00:09:14 with the way my brain works or doesn’t work.’
00:09:19 Is there a way to train the brain
00:09:22 to think in illustration mode?
00:09:25 Yes.
00:09:26 How?
00:09:28 One way is by observing creation
00:09:31 or man-made inventions,
00:09:34 even when you don’t have a talk to give
00:09:36 and even when your children are not with you.
00:09:40 Think about what you observe,
00:09:42 and reason out how it could be applied
00:09:44 as a teaching lesson in the future.
00:09:48 Write it down if you need to so as to remember it.
00:09:52 One father told me that even when his children were not with him,
00:09:56 he would look at creation
00:09:58 and come up with a line of reasoning
00:10:01 that might be helpful in the future.
00:10:03 He gave an example.
00:10:05 He observed two kittens playing together.
00:10:09 He reasoned:
00:10:11 “Do those kittens look happy?
00:10:13 “Yes.
00:10:15 “If Jehovah knows what it takes
00:10:17 “to make two kittens happy,
00:10:19 “do you think he knows
00:10:21 what it would take to make you happy?”
00:10:24 Well, obviously, a child would agree.
00:10:28 “So if Jehovah knows what it would take to make you happy,
00:10:32 what should you do if Jehovah says to do something a certain way?”
00:10:37 Profound, Dad!
00:10:39 Do it Jehovah’s way if you want to be happy.
00:10:43 Now the beautiful reality, the golden moment,
00:10:47 was when he saw one of his sons
00:10:49 watching two squirrels in a tree chasing each other.
00:10:53 He used the squirrels as his illustration,
00:10:56 along with the prepared line of reasoning.
00:11:00 Now his son still remembers that point many decades later.
00:11:06 Jesus’ brain thought creatively when using illustrations.
00:11:12 For another example, please turn with me to John 1:42.
00:11:18 Jesus changed Simon’s name on the spot.
00:11:23 John 1:42:
00:11:25 “And he [Andrew] led him [Simon] to Jesus.
00:11:32 “When Jesus looked at him, he said:
00:11:34 “‘You are Simon, the son of John;
00:11:36 “you will be called Cephas’
00:11:39 (which is translated ‘Peter’).”
00:11:42 Now, why did Jesus change his name to Cephas, or Peter?
00:11:48 It actually seems to be creative thinking.
00:11:51 The Greek word for Peter is Peˈtros, not Peˈtra.
00:11:56 Peˈtra  means “Rock Mass,”
00:11:59 and that applies to Jesus, the cornerstone,
00:12:01 the head of the Christian congregation.
00:12:04 However, Peˈtros  means “A Piece of Rock.”
00:12:08 What a beautiful description of Peter!
00:12:12 At times, Peter didn’t seem to be dependable.
00:12:16 But Jesus saw good qualities in him
00:12:18 and gave him the name Peter (Peˈtros, Piece of Rock).
00:12:24 In effect,
00:12:26 Jesus was saying that he would become as stable as a rock.
00:12:30 And that’s precisely what transpired.
00:12:33 What a great word picture,
00:12:35 or illustration, by Jesus!
00:12:38 At Revelation 1:1,
00:12:40 under inspiration to John,
00:12:42 Jehovah said that that book of the Bible was
00:12:45 “a revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him.”
00:12:51 The Insight  book says:
00:12:53 “The book of Revelation concludes the Holy Scriptures
00:12:57 “with one of the most outstanding concentrations
00:13:00 of illustrations found in the entire Bible.”
00:13:05 You recall our theme is from Matthew 13:34:
00:13:09 “Without an Illustration He Would Not Speak to Them.”
00:13:14 As another example, Jesus gave his famous Sermon on the Mount.
00:13:18 In Matthew chapter 7, the last chapter of that sermon,
00:13:22 he used at least ten different illustrations.
00:13:26 Yes, “without an illustration he would not speak to them.”
00:13:32 Matthew 7:28 sums up the Sermon on the Mount, saying:
00:13:36 “When Jesus finished these sayings,
00:13:40 “the effect was that the crowds were astounded
00:13:43 at his way of teaching.”
00:13:45 First Peter 2:21 says that Jesus left
00:13:49 “a model for [us] to follow his steps closely.”
00:13:53 That includes his art of teaching,
00:13:56 which incorporated extensive use of illustrations.
00:14:00 They were pithy and to the point.
00:14:03 May each of us train ourselves to think that way
00:14:06 and strive to improve our teaching skills
00:14:09 by means of illustrations.
