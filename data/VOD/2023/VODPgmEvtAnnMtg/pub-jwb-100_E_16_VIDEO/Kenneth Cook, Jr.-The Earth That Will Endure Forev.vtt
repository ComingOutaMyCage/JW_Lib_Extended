In the Revelation presented
to the apostle John,

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus pointed ahead many centuries

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the time when Jehovah brings an end

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who oppose his Kingdom.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:14.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 11:18,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
it speaks of such opposers

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “those ruining the earth.”

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
In its entirety, the verse says this

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Revelation 11:18:

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the nations became wrathful,

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your own wrath came,

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the appointed time came
for the dead to be judged

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to reward your slaves the prophets
and the holy ones

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:42.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those fearing your name,
the small and the great,

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:45.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to bring to ruin

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
those ruining the earth.”

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:50.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
This verse assures us

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is going to stop

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ruining of the earth.

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it only man’s pollution of the earth

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:03.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the misuse of its resources
that is being spoken of here?

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is there more to it?

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer those questions,

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:13.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
here are four main points
that we will consider:

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:16.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the earth”
as spoken of in God’s Word?

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:21.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what “ruining” of it
does Revelation 11:18 refer?

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:25.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will Jehovah act to stop it?

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the earth
that will endure forever?

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:33.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, to start, what is meant by “earth”?

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:35.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer that question,

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll look at the planet

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:38.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the people.

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we include the people?

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because “earth,” like some other expressions

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s Word,

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
has more than one basic meaning.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:50.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the word “heaven.”

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:53.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Heaven” has the sense
of that which is high, or lofty,

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:56.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can refer to a number of things.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, at Genesis 27:28,

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:03.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read of Isaac’s blessing for Jacob.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told him in part:

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:10.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the true God give you
the dews of the heavens.”

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The dews of the heavens”

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:16.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
—here “heavens” has
the meaning of “literal sky,” true?

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now compare Daniel 4:26.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this verse, we read
that Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s dream

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:28.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the great tree, and he says to him:

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your kingdom will be yours again

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after you come to know that the heavens

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:36.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ruling.”

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:41.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, this is not the literal sky, is it?

00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:44.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it has reference
to Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:47.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, in the Bible,

00:02:47.183 --> 00:02:51.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “earth”
can have more than one meaning.

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:54.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s look at the planet.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:59.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the planets
that have been named after false gods,

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis chapter 1 tells us

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah named this planet “Earth.”

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the false labeling
of the other planets,

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:11.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be certain that those disgusting names
will soon be gone.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as for the earth, Jehovah leaves us

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
in no doubt about its future.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was created to last forever.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 1:4 states

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
that although generations of people
at this time come and go,

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the earth,” it says
—that is, the planet—

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:34.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remains forever.”

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 104:5 adds
that “it will not be moved from its place

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
forever and ever.”

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:44.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, the planet Earth
will never be destroyed.

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:47.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s purpose for it will be fulfilled.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that purpose?

00:03:50.947 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s purpose
is for the earth to be inhabited

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
by faithful humans
in perfection and happiness

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:02.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
with everlasting life.

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:06.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to the people,
those for whom the earth was made.

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:10.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can hardly mention one
without the other, right?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, many scriptures refer to people

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
when speaking of the earth.

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:17.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are some examples.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:21.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 11:1 says: “Now all the earth

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued to be of one language.”

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:27.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Genesis 24:3,

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham refers to Jehovah as being

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God of the earth,” obviously people.

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 49:13 says:

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:41.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shout for joy, you heavens,
and rejoice, you earth.”

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Revelation 19:2 speaks of false religion

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the great prostitute corrupted the earth

00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:51.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
with her sexual immorality.”

00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, those verses refer to humans
who can speak,

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can worship, who can express joy,

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:02.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who can be corrupted
by sexual immorality.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up to this point,
we’ve looked at the earth then as a planet,

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have reviewed God’s purpose for it,

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:13.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have considered how the word “earth”

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
relates to the people on it.

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider the question,

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:24.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what “ruining”
does Revelation 11:18 refer?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the planet?

00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:26.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people?

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:28.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or both?

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:30.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the planet:

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:34.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hates to see the earth
being ruined today as it is.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:37.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be certain
that he hates the pollution,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
the damage to the earth’s climate,

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
the misuse of its resources,

00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:46.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the devastation of human wars.

00:05:46.362 --> 00:05:49.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cares for what he has made.

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:52.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
After making the earth,
he said “that it was good.”

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:56.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can read about it
in Genesis chapters 1 and 2.

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine Jehovah’s happiness!

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:03.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
This special planet was to be a gift.

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 115:16 states

00:06:05.515 --> 00:06:10.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the earth he has given
to the sons of men.”

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what about the people?

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah’s disgust
at the ruining of the earth apply

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the ruining of mankind as well?

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:24.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see this from what is stated

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Genesis 6:11, 12.

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:31.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this setting, the world of Noah’s day

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
had become ruined in God’s eyes.

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read the verses,

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:41.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for the connection
between the earth and mankind.

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:46.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says at Genesis chapter 6,
starting in verse 11:

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the earth had become ruined
in the sight of the true God,

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the earth was filled with violence.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, God looked upon the earth,
and it was ruined;

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see the connection?

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than speaking of just the planet,

00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:13.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scriptures here link
the ruining of “all flesh,” or people,

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the ruining of the earth.

00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:21.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise today, just as mankind
is harming the actual planet,

00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:24.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
the world under Satan’s control

00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:27.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
is also ruining all flesh.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
In both ways, the earth is being ruined.

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with false religion,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
human society in general
is gradually corrupting everything

00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has set in place for mankind.

00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it
in their incessant nationalistic wars.

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it
in their racial hatred and divisiveness.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:54.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it in their promoting of abortion.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it in their so-called gay marriage.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it in the gender blurring
that the world is promoting.

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:05.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You don’t have to be a man or a woman,”
they say.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You can be whatever you feel like
or choose to be.”

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:10.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah say about that?

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:16.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Deuteronomy 22:5,

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:18.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told the nation of Israel

00:08:18.814 --> 00:08:23.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “a woman must not
put on the clothing of a man,

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:26.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor should a man wear
the clothing of a woman.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:29.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For anyone doing so is detestable

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:32.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah your God.”

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:37.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is how the Creator feels
about the switching of clothing,

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much more detestable
he must view the world’s attempts

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:46.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
to blur the lines of gender
with false labeling!

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, the World Health Organization

00:08:48.978 --> 00:08:51.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
adjusted its view of gender.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:55.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
It now states that “there are many genders

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:59.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
existing on a spectrum from male to female.”

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:03.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
It added that “gender identity

00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“exists on a continuum

00:09:05.328 --> 00:09:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that sex
is not limited to male or female.”

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, really?

00:09:12.401 --> 00:09:16.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about an attempt to tear apart
what Jehovah has made!

00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, even government agencies

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a global scale are getting involved,

00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:24.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are critical of anyone

00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:28.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
who does not adopt their warped view.

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:32.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Proverbs 19:3, it explains:

00:09:32.021 --> 00:09:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is a man’s own foolishness
that distorts his way,

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:39.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his heart
becomes enraged against Jehovah.”

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And going back to marriage,

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:47.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah instituted the arrangement
to be a permanent bond

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
between a man and a woman.

00:09:49.872 --> 00:09:53.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 19:4, 5,

00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read how Jesus emphasized this
while he was on the earth.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Quoting from Genesis 2:24, he said this:

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you not read that the one
who created them from the beginning

00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“made them male and female and said:

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:13.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For this reason a man
will leave his father and his mother

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:15.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and will stick to his wife,

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the two will be one flesh’?”

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:23.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “made them male and female . . . ,

00:10:23.005 --> 00:10:26.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the two will be one flesh.”

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:30.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose for humans is clear.

00:10:30.112 --> 00:10:32.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Satan’s world now says that marriage

00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:35.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be between two men or two women.

00:10:35.985 --> 00:10:38.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, really?

00:10:38.587 --> 00:10:41.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be certain
that promoting this corrupt view

00:10:41.457 --> 00:10:46.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
is part of Satan’s attempt to ruin mankind

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:49.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to make them so abhorrent to Jehovah

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:52.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would abandon humans

00:10:52.335 --> 00:10:55.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his purpose for mankind on the earth.

00:10:55.938 --> 00:10:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that will never happen.

00:10:58.374 --> 00:11:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s purpose for mankind and their home

00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be fulfilled.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:07.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like the disgusting names
of the false gods

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans have given
to the literal planets,

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:13.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
the false labeling of humankind

00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:17.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the immorality will not continue.

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:21.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
For his own name’s sake
and for those who love him,

00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “bring to ruin

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:27.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
those ruining the earth.”

00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:29.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s one thing
to consider Jehovah’s view

00:11:29.905 --> 00:11:32.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
on such matters among ourselves.

00:11:32.274 --> 00:11:35.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are we doing to help other people?

00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:39.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we doing to build respect
for Jehovah’s view of the earth,

00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:41.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s view of humankind,

00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s purpose for their future?

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:48.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with a clear conscience,
we can confidently say

00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:52.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve “not held back”
in speaking the truth about such matters.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, here are some of the articles

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:59.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org that honesthearted ones can read.

00:12:01.337 --> 00:12:05.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
“What Does the Bible Say About Abortion?,”

00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:10.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does the Bible Comment
on Same-Sex Marriages?,”

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “How Can I Explain the Bible’s View
of Homosexuality?”

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:21.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be happy to have such tools
to help other people.

00:12:21.257 --> 00:12:23.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what is more important to Jehovah?

00:12:23.893 --> 00:12:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
The literal planet or the people?

00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:29.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both are highly valued,

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:33.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is why both will endure forever.

00:12:33.302 --> 00:12:35.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the people of the earth

00:12:35.304 --> 00:12:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
are far more important.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:42.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave his Son as a ransom for mankind,

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
not for a planet.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 3:16 says
that “God loved the world so much

00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:50.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that he gave his only-begotten Son,

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:54.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that every one exercising faith in him

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:57.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“might not be destroyed

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have everlasting life.”

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of Jesus, God’s “master worker,”

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 8:31 quotes him as saying:

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I rejoiced over his habitable earth,

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:15.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was especially fond
of the sons of men.”

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing this, what should we continue to do?

00:13:20.683 --> 00:13:23.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we should kindly and respectfully

00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:26.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
help others to see Jehovah’s view

00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
while there is still time.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must never
become “ashamed of the good news,”

00:13:31.594 --> 00:13:34.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it’s not just good news about Paradise.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also good news about Jehovah’s time

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:41.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set things right on earth again.

00:13:41.003 --> 00:13:44.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents with young children
should take courage

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:48.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this fact as they work hard
to protect their children

00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:52.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Satan’s attempts
to ruin their minds and hearts

00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:56.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
with immoral thoughts and false reasoning.

00:13:56.118 --> 00:14:00.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, the end is coming quickly.

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:04.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice what is said
at Revelation chapter 14

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:07.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 6 and 7.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:09.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read it,

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for what an angel includes

00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:14.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the good news that he declares.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says, in part—

00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:18.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation chapter 14,

00:14:18.674 --> 00:14:23.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 6 and 7 says:

00:14:23.846 --> 00:14:28.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He had everlasting good news to declare
to those who dwell on the earth,

00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:35.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was saying in a loud voice:

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Fear God and give him glory,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because the hour of judgment
by him has arrived,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so worship the One
who made the heaven and the earth

00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:50.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sea and the springs of water.’”

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:54.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what does the angel
include in his message,

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:58.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his good news that he is declaring?

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:01.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fear God,” he said, “and give him glory,

00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:05.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the hour of judgment
by him has arrived.”

00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:07.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who love what is right,

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is truly good news.

00:15:12.194 --> 00:15:15.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy to include
this angelic message

00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:18.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we share with other people.

00:15:18.901 --> 00:15:20.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word assures us

00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:25.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 17:31

00:15:25.274 --> 00:15:29.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah “has set a day
on which he purposes to judge

00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:34.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inhabited earth in righteousness”
by means of his Son.

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:36.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a relief and peace

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will bring to those
who want to please Jehovah!

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this talk,
we have examined what is meant

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Bible speaks of “the earth,”

00:15:47.262 --> 00:15:50.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, the planet and the people

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
for whom it was made.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have also considered the fact
that the earth

00:15:55.838 --> 00:16:00.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being ruined in more ways
than just the corrupting of its environment

00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:03.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the misuse of its resources.

00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:06.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
It goes far beyond that, doesn’t it?

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:09.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan and his world are also attempting

00:16:09.251 --> 00:16:11.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ruin Jehovah’s human creation

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
in every way possible,

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:16.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they will fail.

00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:20.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jehovah gave his Son
to save faithful humans

00:16:20.863 --> 00:16:23.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to restore his purpose,

00:16:23.532 --> 00:16:27.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
our next question is, When will it happen?

00:16:27.836 --> 00:16:30.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will Jehovah bring to ruin

00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
those ruining the earth?

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer to that question is soon,
very soon.

00:16:36.612 --> 00:16:38.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ruining of mankind in their home

00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:41.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be allowed to go on.

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:44.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let no one be mistaken about it.

00:16:44.186 --> 00:16:46.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is resolved.

00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:48.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is patient . . .

00:16:48.223 --> 00:16:51.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not desire anyone to be destroyed.”

00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:55.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he is determined; his “day is coming.”

00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:59.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 3:13 assures us

00:16:59.134 --> 00:17:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “there are new heavens and a new earth

00:17:01.737 --> 00:17:06.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are awaiting
according to his promise.”

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:09.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
That promised “new earth”
is a new human society

00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:14.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will worship and serve
the only true God forever.

00:17:15.017 --> 00:17:17.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who persist in ruining the earth

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be a part of it.

00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:22.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 19:28,

00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:26.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus speaks of this coming change

00:17:26.228 --> 00:17:30.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a time of “re-creation.”

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:33.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note for that verse
says that re-creation

00:17:33.202 --> 00:17:37.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “regeneration; [or] renewal.”

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
It then adds that the re-creation is

00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:44.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the time when the rule of Christ
and his corulers

00:17:44.113 --> 00:17:48.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will bring to the earth
a renewal of the perfect conditions

00:17:48.383 --> 00:17:52.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyed by the first humans
before they sinned.”

00:17:52.755 --> 00:17:56.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful to think about!

00:17:56.325 --> 00:18:01.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
The re-creation will set things straight
after a failed rebellion.

00:18:01.196 --> 00:18:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will fulfill Jehovah’s purpose
for the earth.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:10.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what is “the earth”
that is being ruined today?

00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:11.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have discussed,

00:18:11.974 --> 00:18:13.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is the planet

00:18:13.642 --> 00:18:15.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the people being corrupted

00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Satan’s world.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is “the earth”

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will endure forever?

00:18:22.117 --> 00:18:24.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the planet.

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have read, the Scriptures are clear

00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:29.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it will last forever.

00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:30.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, and most important,

00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:33.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people are “the new earth,”

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
those for whom Jesus died

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who respond to the good news.

00:18:38.767 --> 00:18:41.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
The re-creation is coming.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:45.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will not waste
a single day of the thousand years,

00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:48.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
not one day of it.

00:18:49.912 --> 00:18:51.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s determined to honor Jehovah

00:18:51.413 --> 00:18:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accomplish His purpose for the earth.

00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:59.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
The future is not complicated.

00:18:59.421 --> 00:19:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose is not hard to understand.

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
The coming time of re-creation
will bring about a rejuvenated earth,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
a rejuvenated planet,
filled with perfect people

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
who love and serve Jehovah together.

00:19:15.771 --> 00:19:20.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the earth that will endure forever.
