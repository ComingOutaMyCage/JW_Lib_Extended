00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:05.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 13:52,

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that “every public instructor”

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
was like a man with a “treasure store”

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
filled with truths, old and new.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that’s true.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:22.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if it’s true,
it means that this audience

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:26.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
is among the most rich people
in the entire world.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have a large ‘treasure store

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
of truths both old and new.’

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the question,

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do with your treasure store?

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:46.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at Deuteronomy 29:29,

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses gave these words;

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:56.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “The things concealed
belong to Jehovah our God,

00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the things revealed belong to us

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:04.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and [and]

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to our descendants forever,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may carry out all the words

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:12.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this Law.”

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:15.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s a fundamental truth there.

00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the truth
never solely belongs to us.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:24.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather,
it also belongs to our descendants

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to all of our sons and daughters
who are to come.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that means
that as men and women of faith,

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:36.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a clear responsibility

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share
(to pass on)

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:42.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wonderful truths
that we have come to know

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:44.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the next generation.

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:46.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible emphasizes this.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read what the psalmist said

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 78:3.

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 78:3 says:

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The things we have heard and know,

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which our fathers have related to us,

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will not hide from their sons;

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will relate to the generation to come

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:16.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah
and his strength,

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wonderful things he has done.”

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now this includes

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than just the basic truths.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:30.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also includes all of the wonderful things

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve been taught
by other brothers and sisters,

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the experiences that we’ve had,

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:42.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experiencing
the hand of Jehovah in our own lives.

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:46.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah took the matter
of passing this on

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:49.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the next generation very seriously,

00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:53.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
because look at what it says in verse 5.

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:57.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “He established a reminder in Jacob

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and set a law in Israel;

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He commanded our forefathers

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make these things
known to their children,

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:08.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the next generation,

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the children yet to be born,
might know them.

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:17.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
They in turn
would relate them to their children.”

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those of you
who have so much wisdom and experience,

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you feel that responsibility to share

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you have with the generations to come?

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we get the sense

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Deuteronomy 29:29
and Psalm 78,

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:40.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
well then, we will do this.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will share what we have
with the next generation.

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do we do it?

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, this process begins
with all of our parents,

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:53.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
by their following the command

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Deuteronomy 6:6, 7

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach their children
as ‘they sit in the house,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they walk on the road,
when they lie down, and when they get up.’

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:11.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the process does not end
with the Christian parents.

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have a responsibility

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:18.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach and train young adults

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can take on responsibility

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s congregation.

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Bible is filled
with examples of individuals

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are wonderful trainers.

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:34.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe one who comes to mind
right away is Moses.

00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:38.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems that in the Bible,
whenever you see Moses, you see Joshua.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re always together.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the wonderful training

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Moses was able to impart to Joshua

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they worked together
for more than 40 years?

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:54.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses not only told Joshua

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also he showed him.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:01.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by being with him,
he was able to observe his fine example.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when the time was ready,

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Moses was ready
to hand over the responsibility,

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what he says here
at Deuteronomy chapter 31

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 7.

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Moses then called Joshua

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to him
before the eyes of all Israel:

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘Be courageous and strong,

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘for you are the one
who will bring this people

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘into the land that Jehovah
swore to their forefathers to give to them,

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘and you will give it to them
as an inheritance.

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:39.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘Jehovah is the one marching before you,

00:05:39.288 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘and he will continue with you.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘He will neither desert you
nor abandon you.

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:48.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be afraid or be terrified.’”

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, can you imagine
how Moses must have felt

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say those words to this young man

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:59.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom he had worked so hard
all of these years with?

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s not the only example
that is in the Scriptures.

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:06.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Paul and Timothy?

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Timothy
was probably in his late teens or early 20’s

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:12.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul met him at Lystra.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul do?

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took that young man
along with him on his tours,

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
going from congregation to congregation.

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
He put him in the mind of his methods.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
He taught him.

00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result, Timothy came to be

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
a solid, mature Christian man

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was able to strengthen
the congregations of God’s people.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what Paul said about him

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Philippians chapter 2?

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s quite a recommendation.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 2:20,

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:50.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul said:

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I have no one else
of a disposition like his

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:59.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will genuinely care for your concerns.”

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tremendous recommendation!

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:06.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because Paul had invested
that time into Timothy,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knew the fine qualities
that young man had.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Paul not only wanted Timothy

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take that training himself

00:07:16.552 --> 00:07:20.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’ll recall that in 2 Timothy chapter 2

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gave advice to Timothy
as to what he was to do

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:28.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all of that fine training
that he had received.

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:33.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Timothy 2:2, Paul said:

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:36.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the things you heard from me

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:39.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that were supported by many witnesses,

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:43.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“these things entrust to faithful men,

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:47.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who, in turn, will be adequately qualified

00:07:47.817 --> 00:07:49.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach others.”

00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that training
would go on to future brothers

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future generations
of servants of Jehovah.

00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:01.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul invested training in a very young man,

00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it paid off.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our modern day,

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:08.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think of Brother Nathan Knorr

00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:11.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an outstanding trainer.

00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he became the president
of the Watch Tower Society

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
in January of 1942,

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:20.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was only 36 years old.

00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:23.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now he could have thought: ‘I’m so young.

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have a huge—

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have many, many years ahead of me
to be able to care for matters.

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:33.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so there really isn’t
any need to train others.’

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:36.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Brother Knorr
did not have that disposition.

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:40.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a trainer even at that young age.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
He assigned Brother Milton Henschel,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was in his mid-20’s,

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be his secretary.

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr took Brother Henschel with him

00:08:51.514 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his travels all over the world

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:58.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
to branches and missionary homes
to strengthen the brothers.

00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:03.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had him right by his side
at major conventions,

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just telling him

00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
but showing him how to take the lead.

00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:12.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Henschel absorbed that training.

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:17.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1947, he was a member
of the board of directors

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:20.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Society
at only 27 years old.

00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he went on to serve
as a member of the Governing Body.

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:30.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr trained
other young brothers like Don Adams.

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
This photo that we’re about to show 

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:38.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
was taken at a gathering
on Brother Adams’ 70th anniversary

00:09:38.294 --> 00:09:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
in full-time service.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here you see
another group of young men

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:49.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Brother Knorr had trained
—Robert Wallen, Charles Molohan,

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:53.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
David Sinclair, and Don Adams.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these men were identified
when they were very young,

00:09:56.946 --> 00:10:01.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they worked together
for more than 50 years faithfully.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helped Brother Knorr

00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:06.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
to choose very well.

00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:08.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it didn’t end there.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr also appointed
well-qualified young brothers

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:17.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were Gilead graduates
to assignments with great responsibility.

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:10:19.302 --> 00:10:24.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Little was assigned
to be the branch servant in Canada

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:26.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was 34 years old.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Denton Hopkinson

00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:32.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
was assigned as the branch servant
in the Philippines

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was 33 years old,

00:10:36.152 --> 00:10:37.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Brother Richard Kelsey

00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
was assigned
as the branch servant in Germany

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was 38.

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
When appointed, Brother Kelsey
said to Brother Knorr, “But I’m only 38.”

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:49.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Knorr said,

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:53.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, yeah, that’s about the age I was
when I became president.”

00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr once again had chosen well.

00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:02.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those last three brothers
are all still serving

00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:06.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the branch committees
in their respective lands and are all members

00:11:06.782 --> 00:11:10.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible
and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are tied in today for this meeting.

00:11:12.555 --> 00:11:14.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:30.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a lesson here, brothers.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:32.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a lesson:

00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:37.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr expressed confidence
in humble young brothers.

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:41.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed them to take on responsibility,

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that proved to be a wonderful blessing

00:11:44.987 --> 00:11:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s people.

00:11:47.323 --> 00:11:51.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the lesson, then, for elders,

00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:53.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
for circuit overseers,
for branch committee members

00:11:53.729 --> 00:11:58.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
—really, for all mature brothers
in the congregation?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must actively be training and teaching

00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:06.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next generation of ministerial servants,

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:08.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next generation of elders,

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next generation of circuit overseers.

00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:16.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we must take
this responsibility seriously

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the truth belongs not just to us.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also belongs to our sons,
to our descendants.

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:30.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must pass on the truth, the wisdom,

00:12:30.132 --> 00:12:34.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience that we have
in our treasure store

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
to these next “Joshuas,”
these next “Timothys”

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:41.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will raise up.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, that’s the role of the trainers.

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:47.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the role of you younger brothers

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:49.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are listening to this program?

00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s your responsibility to work hard

00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:55.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the Scriptural qualifications

00:12:55.925 --> 00:13:00.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ministerial servants
and later for elders.

00:13:00.262 --> 00:13:03.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seek out training.

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:06.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask for advice.
Ask for counsel.

00:13:06.602 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be eager to learn from older brothers

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:14.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are rich in wisdom and experience.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to help you grow,
those brothers may give you some counsel.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:22.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may even correct you from time to time.

00:13:22.351 --> 00:13:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you love them for doing that?

00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:31.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jacob, who wrestled with an angel
to receive a blessing,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
you too may have to wrestle.

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may have to struggle at times

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:40.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get that blessing, to reach that goal.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:45.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you work hard
and if you look to Jehovah for his help,

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will grow spiritually.

00:13:47.443 --> 00:13:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will draw close to him.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:54.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who knows
what responsibilities may come to you?

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:59.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the Governing Body doing
to support efforts to train young brothers?

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in January of this year,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body requested

00:14:03.459 --> 00:14:06.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
all bodies of elders worldwide

00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:09.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give priority
to helping younger brothers

00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:12.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow in their relationship
with Jehovah

00:14:12.468 --> 00:14:17.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to qualify
for congregation responsibilities.

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:20.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders and circuit overseers
were reminded

00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:23.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
that young brothers
who apply themselves

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:26.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
may qualify as ministerial servants

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:28.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their late teens 

00:14:28.984 --> 00:14:32.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that an exceptional ministerial servant

00:14:32.187 --> 00:14:36.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has gained experience
in shepherding and teaching

00:14:36.425 --> 00:14:40.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
could serve as an elder in his early 20’s.

00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:45.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another arrangement

00:14:45.067 --> 00:14:47.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have not publicly announced before,

00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:50.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we will today.

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:53.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Circuit overseers have also been informed

00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:56.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they may invite qualified young brothers

00:14:56.111 --> 00:15:00.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the ages of 21 and 23

00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:05.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:10.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please don’t all call
your circuit overseer at once.

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:14.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the efforts do not end there.

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:17.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah willing, in January 2023,

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:20.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:15:20.035 --> 00:15:22.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
will again begin functioning

00:15:22.104 --> 00:15:25.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
in person worldwide.

00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:30.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we resume
in-person regional conventions,

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:33.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
just imagine the joy that we’ll have

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeing younger brothers get up

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:40.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give their first talk
at a regional convention.

00:15:40.923 --> 00:15:43.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Won’t that be wonderful?
Are you looking forward to it?

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:58.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Governing Body
has another new initiative.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:01.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Governing Body members
will now have the possibility

00:16:01.944 --> 00:16:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take a younger brother along with them

00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they make
shepherding visits to the branches,

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appointed Governing Body helpers

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:13.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are headquarters representatives

00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:17.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
will also be allowed
to take a younger brother with them

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:19.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they make their branch visits.

00:16:19.495 --> 00:16:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
These arrangements will allow many brothers

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive additional training

00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:29.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
directly from Governing Body members
and helpers.

00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:34.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what have we discussed
in this brief talk?

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has allowed us to know the truth.

00:16:37.946 --> 00:16:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s allowed us to be trained.

00:16:39.948 --> 00:16:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s allowed us
to gain wisdom and experience

00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:46.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other experienced brothers and sisters.

00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:49.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
What now is our responsibility?

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s read it in Psalm 71,

00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:55.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the psalmist put it
so beautifully here

00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:59.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 71:17:

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:04.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O God, you have taught me from my youth,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and until now I keep declaring

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your wonderful works.

00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:14.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even when I am old and gray,
O God, do not abandon me.

00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:18.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let me tell the next generation

00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about your power and about your mightiness

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all those who are to come.”

00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:30.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers, please let us work hard

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:32.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the wonderful truths,

00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:36.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience, the wisdom
that we have gained

00:17:36.438 --> 00:17:39.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the generation to come.
