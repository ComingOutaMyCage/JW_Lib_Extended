00:00:01 At Matthew 13:52,
00:00:05 Jesus said that “every public instructor”
00:00:08 was like a man with a “treasure store”
00:00:11 filled with truths, old and new.
00:00:16 Well, we know that’s true.
00:00:17 And if it’s true, it means that this audience
00:00:22 is among the most rich people in the entire world.
00:00:26 You have a large ‘treasure store
00:00:29 of truths both old and new.’
00:00:34 But here’s the question,
00:00:36 What will you do with your treasure store?
00:00:41 Now, at Deuteronomy 29:29,
00:00:48 Moses gave these words;
00:00:51 he said: “The things concealed belong to Jehovah our God,
00:00:57 “but the things revealed belong to us
00:01:00 “and [and]
00:01:04 “to our descendants forever,
00:01:07 “so that we may carry out all the words
00:01:10 of this Law.”
00:01:12 Well, there’s a fundamental truth there.
00:01:15 You see, the truth never solely belongs to us.
00:01:19 But, rather, it also belongs to our descendants
00:01:24 —to all of our sons and daughters who are to come.
00:01:28 Well, that means that as men and women of faith,
00:01:32 we have a clear responsibility
00:01:36 to share (to pass on)
00:01:39 the wonderful truths that we have come to know
00:01:42 with the next generation.
00:01:44 Well, the Bible emphasizes this.
00:01:46 Let’s read what the psalmist said
00:01:49 in Psalm 78:3.
00:01:54 Psalm 78:3 says:
00:01:58 “The things we have heard and know,
00:02:01 “which our fathers have related to us,
00:02:04 “we will not hide from their sons;
00:02:08 “we will relate to the generation to come
00:02:11 “the praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah and his strength,
00:02:16 the wonderful things he has done.”
00:02:20 Well, now this includes
00:02:23 more than just the basic truths.
00:02:27 It also includes all of the wonderful things
00:02:30 that we’ve been taught by other brothers and sisters,
00:02:35 all the experiences that we’ve had,
00:02:37 and experiencing the hand of Jehovah in our own lives.
00:02:42 Well, Jehovah took the matter of passing this on
00:02:46 to the next generation very seriously,
00:02:49 because look at what it says in verse 5.
00:02:53 It says: “He established a reminder in Jacob
00:02:57 “and set a law in Israel;
00:03:00 “He commanded our forefathers
00:03:02 “to make these things known to their children,
00:03:06 “so that the next generation,
00:03:08 “the children yet to be born, might know them.
00:03:12 They in turn would relate them to their children.”
00:03:17 Well, brothers and sisters,
00:03:19 especially those of you who have so much wisdom and experience,
00:03:23 do you feel that responsibility to share
00:03:28 what you have with the generations to come?
00:03:32 Well, if we get the sense
00:03:34 of Deuteronomy 29:29 and Psalm 78,
00:03:38 well then, we will do this.
00:03:40 We will share what we have with the next generation.
00:03:44 But how do we do it?
00:03:46 Well, of course, this process begins with all of our parents,
00:03:50 by their following the command
00:03:53 in Deuteronomy 6:6, 7
00:03:57 to teach their children as ‘they sit in the house,
00:04:00 as they walk on the road, when they lie down, and when they get up.’
00:04:06 But the process does not end with the Christian parents.
00:04:11 We also have a responsibility
00:04:14 to teach and train young adults
00:04:18 so that they can take on responsibility
00:04:21 in Jehovah’s congregation.
00:04:24 Now, the Bible is filled with examples of individuals
00:04:28 who are wonderful trainers.
00:04:30 Maybe one who comes to mind right away is Moses.
00:04:34 It seems that in the Bible, whenever you see Moses, you see Joshua.
00:04:38 They’re always together.
00:04:40 Can you imagine the wonderful training
00:04:43 that Moses was able to impart to Joshua
00:04:46 as they worked together for more than 40 years?
00:04:51 Moses not only told Joshua
00:04:54 but also he showed him.
00:04:56 And by being with him, he was able to observe his fine example.
00:05:01 Well, when the time was ready,
00:05:04 when Moses was ready to hand over the responsibility,
00:05:08 notice what he says here at Deuteronomy chapter 31
00:05:14 and verse 7.
00:05:16 It says: “Moses then called Joshua
00:05:19 “and said to him before the eyes of all Israel:
00:05:23 ‘‘‘Be courageous and strong,
00:05:26 ‘‘‘for you are the one who will bring this people
00:05:28 ‘‘‘into the land that Jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them,
00:05:33 ‘‘‘and you will give it to them as an inheritance.
00:05:36 ‘‘‘Jehovah is the one marching before you,
00:05:39 ‘‘‘and he will continue with you.
00:05:41 ‘‘‘He will neither desert you nor abandon you.
00:05:44 Do not be afraid or be terrified.’”
00:05:48 Well, can you imagine how Moses must have felt
00:05:52 to say those words to this young man
00:05:55 whom he had worked so hard all of these years with?
00:06:00 Well, that’s not the only example that is in the Scriptures.
00:06:03 What about Paul and Timothy?
00:06:06 We know that Timothy was probably in his late teens or early 20’s
00:06:10 when Paul met him at Lystra.
00:06:12 What did Paul do?
00:06:14 He took that young man along with him on his tours,
00:06:18 going from congregation to congregation.
00:06:21 He put him in the mind of his methods.
00:06:24 He taught him.
00:06:26 And as a result, Timothy came to be
00:06:29 a solid, mature Christian man
00:06:32 who was able to strengthen the congregations of God’s people.
00:06:36 Do you remember what Paul said about him
00:06:39 in Philippians chapter 2?
00:06:41 It’s quite a recommendation.
00:06:43 At Philippians 2:20,
00:06:48 Paul said:
00:06:50 “For I have no one else of a disposition like his
00:06:55 who will genuinely care for your concerns.”
00:06:59 What a tremendous recommendation!
00:07:02 But because Paul had invested that time into Timothy,
00:07:06 he knew the fine qualities that young man had.
00:07:10 Well, Paul not only wanted Timothy
00:07:14 to take that training himself
00:07:16 but you’ll recall that in 2 Timothy chapter 2
00:07:20 he gave advice to Timothy as to what he was to do
00:07:24 with all of that fine training that he had received.
00:07:28 At 2 Timothy 2:2, Paul said:
00:07:33 “And the things you heard from me
00:07:36 “that were supported by many witnesses,
00:07:39 “these things entrust to faithful men,
00:07:43 “who, in turn, will be adequately qualified
00:07:47 to teach others.”
00:07:49 So that training would go on to future brothers
00:07:53 and future generations of servants of Jehovah.
00:07:57 Paul invested training in a very young man,
00:08:01 and it paid off.
00:08:03 In our modern day,
00:08:06 I think of Brother Nathan Knorr
00:08:08 as an outstanding trainer.
00:08:11 When he became the president of the Watch Tower Society
00:08:14 in January of 1942,
00:08:17 he was only 36 years old.
00:08:20 Now he could have thought: ‘I’m so young.
00:08:23 ‘I have a huge—
00:08:25 ‘I have many, many years ahead of me to be able to care for matters.
00:08:29 And so there really isn’t any need to train others.’
00:08:33 But Brother Knorr did not have that disposition.
00:08:36 He was a trainer even at that young age.
00:08:40 He assigned Brother Milton Henschel,
00:08:43 who was in his mid-20’s,
00:08:46 to be his secretary.
00:08:49 Brother Knorr took Brother Henschel with him
00:08:51 on his travels all over the world
00:08:54 to branches and missionary homes to strengthen the brothers.
00:08:58 He had him right by his side at major conventions,
00:09:03 not just telling him
00:09:05 but showing him how to take the lead.
00:09:08 And Brother Henschel absorbed that training.
00:09:12 By 1947, he was a member of the board of directors
00:09:17 of the Watch Tower Society at only 27 years old.
00:09:20 And he went on to serve as a member of the Governing Body.
00:09:25 Brother Knorr trained other young brothers like Don Adams.
00:09:30 This photo that we’re about to show
00:09:33 was taken at a gathering on Brother Adams’ 70th anniversary
00:09:38 in full-time service.
00:09:41 Now, here you see another group of young men
00:09:44 that Brother Knorr had trained —Robert Wallen, Charles Molohan,
00:09:49 David Sinclair, and Don Adams.
00:09:53 All of these men were identified when they were very young,
00:09:56 and they worked together for more than 50 years faithfully.
00:10:01 Jehovah helped Brother Knorr
00:10:04 to choose very well.
00:10:06 But it didn’t end there.
00:10:08 Brother Knorr also appointed well-qualified young brothers
00:10:13 who were Gilead graduates to assignments with great responsibility.
00:10:17 For example,
00:10:19 Brother Kenneth Little was assigned to be the branch servant in Canada
00:10:24 when he was 34 years old.
00:10:27 Brother Denton Hopkinson
00:10:29 was assigned as the branch servant in the Philippines
00:10:32 when he was 33 years old,
00:10:36 and Brother Richard Kelsey
00:10:37 was assigned as the branch servant in Germany
00:10:40 when he was 38.
00:10:43 When appointed, Brother Kelsey said to Brother Knorr, “But I’m only 38.”
00:10:48 And Brother Knorr said,
00:10:49 “Well, yeah, that’s about the age I was when I became president.”
00:10:55 Brother Knorr once again had chosen well.
00:10:59 Those last three brothers are all still serving
00:11:02 on the branch committees in their respective lands and are all members
00:11:06 of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:11:10 who are tied in today for this meeting.
00:11:12 Isn’t that wonderful?
00:11:28 But there’s a lesson here, brothers.
00:11:30 There’s a lesson:
00:11:32 Brother Knorr expressed confidence in humble young brothers.
00:11:37 He allowed them to take on responsibility,
00:11:41 and that proved to be a wonderful blessing
00:11:44 for Jehovah’s people.
00:11:47 Well, what’s the lesson, then, for elders,
00:11:51 for circuit overseers, for branch committee members
00:11:53 —really, for all mature brothers in the congregation?
00:11:59 We must actively be training and teaching
00:12:03 the next generation of ministerial servants,
00:12:06 the next generation of elders,
00:12:08 the next generation of circuit overseers.
00:12:12 And we must take this responsibility seriously
00:12:16 because the truth belongs not just to us.
00:12:20 It also belongs to our sons, to our descendants.
00:12:25 We must pass on the truth, the wisdom,
00:12:30 the experience that we have in our treasure store
00:12:34 to these next “Joshuas,” these next “Timothys”
00:12:38 that Jehovah will raise up.
00:12:41 But now, that’s the role of the trainers.
00:12:44 What is the role of you younger brothers
00:12:47 who are listening to this program?
00:12:49 Well, it’s your responsibility to work hard
00:12:53 to meet the Scriptural qualifications
00:12:55 for ministerial servants and later for elders.
00:13:00 Seek out training.
00:13:03 Ask for advice. Ask for counsel.
00:13:06 Be eager to learn from older brothers
00:13:10 who are rich in wisdom and experience.
00:13:14 Now, to help you grow, those brothers may give you some counsel.
00:13:19 They may even correct you from time to time.
00:13:22 Will you love them for doing that?
00:13:26 Like Jacob, who wrestled with an angel to receive a blessing,
00:13:31 you too may have to wrestle.
00:13:33 You may have to struggle at times
00:13:35 to get that blessing, to reach that goal.
00:13:40 But if you work hard and if you look to Jehovah for his help,
00:13:45 you will grow spiritually.
00:13:47 You will draw close to him.
00:13:49 And who knows what responsibilities may come to you?
00:13:54 What is the Governing Body doing to support efforts to train young brothers?
00:13:59 Well, in January of this year,
00:14:01 the Governing Body requested
00:14:03 all bodies of elders worldwide
00:14:06 to give priority to helping younger brothers
00:14:09 grow in their relationship with Jehovah
00:14:12 and to qualify for congregation responsibilities.
00:14:17 Elders and circuit overseers were reminded
00:14:20 that young brothers who apply themselves
00:14:23 may qualify as ministerial servants
00:14:26 in their late teens
00:14:28 and that an exceptional ministerial servant
00:14:32 who has gained experience in shepherding and teaching
00:14:36 could serve as an elder in his early 20’s.
00:14:42 Now, here’s another arrangement
00:14:45 that we have not publicly announced before,
00:14:47 but we will today.
00:14:50 Circuit overseers have also been informed
00:14:53 that they may invite qualified young brothers
00:14:56 between the ages of 21 and 23
00:15:00 to apply to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:15:05 Please don’t all call your circuit overseer at once.
00:15:10 But the efforts do not end there.
00:15:14 Jehovah willing, in January 2023,
00:15:17 the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:15:20 will again begin functioning
00:15:22 in person worldwide.
00:15:25 And as we resume in-person regional conventions,
00:15:30 just imagine the joy that we’ll have
00:15:33 in seeing younger brothers get up
00:15:37 and give their first talk at a regional convention.
00:15:40 Won’t that be wonderful? Are you looking forward to it?
00:15:55 But the Governing Body has another new initiative.
00:15:58 Governing Body members will now have the possibility
00:16:01 to take a younger brother along with them
00:16:04 when they make shepherding visits to the branches,
00:16:08 and appointed Governing Body helpers
00:16:11 who are headquarters representatives
00:16:13 will also be allowed to take a younger brother with them
00:16:17 when they make their branch visits.
00:16:19 These arrangements will allow many brothers
00:16:23 to receive additional training
00:16:25 directly from Governing Body members and helpers.
00:16:30 Well, what have we discussed in this brief talk?
00:16:34 Jehovah has allowed us to know the truth.
00:16:37 He’s allowed us to be trained.
00:16:39 He’s allowed us to gain wisdom and experience
00:16:42 from other experienced brothers and sisters.
00:16:46 What now is our responsibility?
00:16:49 Well, let’s read it in Psalm 71,
00:16:52 because the psalmist put it so beautifully here
00:16:55 at Psalm 71:17:
00:17:00 “O God, you have taught me from my youth,
00:17:04 “and until now I keep declaring
00:17:07 “your wonderful works.
00:17:10 “Even when I am old and gray, O God, do not abandon me.
00:17:14 “Let me tell the next generation
00:17:18 “about your power and about your mightiness
00:17:22 to all those who are to come.”
00:17:25 Dear brothers, please let us work hard
00:17:30 to share the wonderful truths,
00:17:32 the experience, the wisdom that we have gained
00:17:36 with the generation to come.
