00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:04.192 line:10% position:50% align:center
Planning for the new

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:07.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
Patterson Visitors’ Center began in 2018.

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:11.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
A project development group was formed

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:13.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the goal of starting construction,

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
but unforeseen challenges
were about to occur.

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:20.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
In March of 2020,
an outbreak of COVID-19

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the New York area

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused Bethel to go into a full lockdown.

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:29.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the design group
see Jehovah’s blessing on the project

00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:31.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this unprecedented time?

00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:35.768 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, when Bethel locked down

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.519 line:10% position:50% align:center
and suspended in-person meetings,

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.313 line:10% position:50% align:center
so did the town of Patterson.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
This created a serious challenge
for us to obtain the necessary approvals

00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:47.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep the project moving forward.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with the threat of falling months behind,

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:53.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to rely on Jehovah
and alter our approach.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a local elder was given permission

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:59.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the town planning board meetings
in person once they opened up.

00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed us, as a design team,

00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a presentation
effectively but remotely.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:10.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw Jehovah’s hand
and his blessing on this entire arrangement.

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:13.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
So through months of meetings,
we were able to get the approvals needed

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:14.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then get a building permit

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:17.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin construction

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:19.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of this taking place
during the lockdown!

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:23.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following all the local guidelines,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch found a way
to bring skilled brothers and sisters

00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:29.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the “Bethel bubble” safely

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they could work on the project.

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:37.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah caused many volunteers
to “offer themselves willingly” to help.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.339 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here we are,

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:42.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
building the Patterson Visitors’ Center

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.677 line:10% position:50% align:center
during a most unique time in history,

00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:48.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of a global pandemic.

00:01:49.473 --> 00:01:52.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brotherhood
has demonstrated ‘a heart for the work’

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
through contributions

00:01:55.104 --> 00:01:57.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brothers and sisters
offering their skills

00:01:57.648 --> 00:02:00.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of which are quite unique.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so encouraging to see

00:02:02.153 --> 00:02:04.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has come to our aid

00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
with supply issues

00:02:06.783 --> 00:02:09.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Bethel departments have cooperated

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:11.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provided skilled people to help us.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been so encouraging.

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
All involved have seen Jehovah’s hand
guiding the way

00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
through these challenging circumstances.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some may wonder,

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:24.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘At a time when guests
are not allowed on Bethel property,

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:28.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
why is this visitors’ center
so important to Jehovah?’

00:02:29.808 --> 00:02:33.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
The physical buildings
at Bethel are attractive,

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:37.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what’s more valuable to Jehovah
is what happens inside.

00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:40.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the spiritual gift that he has in store

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:43.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all who come to visit
that is so important.

00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:46.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Patterson Visitors’ Center is designed

00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:50.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be an immersive
theocratic experience for everyone.

00:03:04.012 --> 00:03:06.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Patterson Visitors’ Center

00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:09.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
will feature three museums
and a coin display.

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:14.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our feature museum
will be a first-century Bible village.

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
The objective is to educate visitors

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:26.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what life was like in the first century

00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:30.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby bring Bible accounts to life.

00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:33.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will get a sense of what things were like

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:35.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus walked the earth.

00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:39.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the Israelites lived off the land,

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:41.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience begins

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an overview of the annual crop cycles

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:49.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
that formed the core
of so much of their daily activities.

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:52.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Key agricultural tasks, such as threshing,

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:54.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
winnowing, and grinding grain,

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be illustrated

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
with interactive displays.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know you will find the exhibit components,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the functioning
olive press and wine press,

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:09.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
very interesting and informative.

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:27.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next stop will be
a typical first-century market.

00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:31.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you will see some of the food and goods

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:33.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would have been available

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:35.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
depending on the season of the year.

00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:40.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
We next invite you
into the residence and workshop spaces

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:43.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a typical first-century Israelite family.

00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:46.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
The manger,

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:49.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
carpentry shop,

00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:52.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
weaving and fabric dying displays

00:04:52.964 --> 00:04:56.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
will illustrate
a number of Israelite activities.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
The residence courtyard area

00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:01.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
will show other regular home tasks

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
like grain grinding and basket making.

00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:07.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
We next invite you

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:09.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a typical Israelite home

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:11.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
and out onto a rooftop

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
overlooking the rest of the village.

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:18.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you leave the residences,

00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will also see an upper room

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would have been
in some of the Israelite homes.

00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:29.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next area
of the first-century Bible village

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can explore is the synagogue,

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:39.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was the center of worship and study
in the Jewish community.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:43.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, a functioning pottery wheel and kiln

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:46.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
will illustrate how pottery was made.

00:05:46.856 --> 00:05:49.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last stop will take you to a lakeside

00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you will be able
to board a first-century fishing boat

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:58.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
similar to the one
that Jesus and his disciples used.

00:05:58.243 --> 00:06:02.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you can learn what was involved
in commercial fishing.

00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:21.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
This and so much more

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:22.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
is waiting for you

00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:26.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the new Patterson Visitors’ Center.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t wait for you to come and see

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:33.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
the beautiful spiritual gift
that is waiting for you!

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new visitors’ center and museum
are on course to be completed

00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the fall of 2023.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will guests be able to come back
to Bethel and tour the new facility?

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are going to have to wait and see.

00:06:56.473 --> 00:06:58.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one thing is for sure:

00:06:58.392 --> 00:07:00.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the doors finally do open,

00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:02.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
anyone who makes the effort to come

00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:05.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive a spiritual gift from Jehovah.

00:07:06.484 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
The touring experience
will prove to be a spiritual encouragement

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and promote pure worship

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:18.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s praise and honor
in a very unique way.

00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:22.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will certainly be a must-see.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:24.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve seen
the blessings on this project

00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:27.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, really, all the people
working hard on it.

00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:30.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
The facility is going to benefit
thousands of future visitors.

00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:34.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because all of us,

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:36.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
either now or in the new world,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to be taught
about the life and ministry of Jesus.

00:07:39.687 --> 00:07:41.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason, we’re convinced

00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:43.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s blessing on the project

00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:45.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his desire to have this facility built.

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:49.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jehovah’s desire
that people come to his house

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:52.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be refreshed and educated.

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:57.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our prayer
that this new and thrilling visitors’ center

00:07:57.498 --> 00:07:59.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
will accomplish that.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guests will come, they will be upbuilt,

00:08:02.545 --> 00:08:06.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will draw closer to Jehovah God.
