00:00:02 Planning for the new
00:00:04 Patterson Visitors’ Center began in 2018.
00:00:08 A project development group was formed
00:00:11 with the goal of starting construction,
00:00:13 but unforeseen challenges were about to occur.
00:00:17 In March of 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19
00:00:20 in the New York area
00:00:22 caused Bethel to go into a full lockdown.
00:00:25 How did the design group see Jehovah’s blessing on the project
00:00:29 during this unprecedented time?
00:00:34 Well, when Bethel locked down
00:00:35 and suspended in-person meetings,
00:00:37 so did the town of Patterson.
00:00:39 This created a serious challenge for us to obtain the necessary approvals
00:00:44 and to keep the project moving forward.
00:00:47 So with the threat of falling months behind,
00:00:50 we had to rely on Jehovah and alter our approach.
00:00:53 So a local elder was given permission
00:00:55 to attend the town planning board meetings in person once they opened up.
00:00:59 He allowed us, as a design team,
00:01:01 to make a presentation effectively but remotely.
00:01:05 We saw Jehovah’s hand and his blessing on this entire arrangement.
00:01:10 So through months of meetings, we were able to get the approvals needed
00:01:13 and then get a building permit
00:01:14 to begin construction
00:01:17 —all of this taking place during the lockdown!
00:01:22 Following all the local guidelines,
00:01:23 the branch found a way to bring skilled brothers and sisters
00:01:27 into the “Bethel bubble” safely
00:01:29 so they could work on the project.
00:01:32 Jehovah caused many volunteers to “offer themselves willingly” to help.
00:01:40 Here we are,
00:01:41 building the Patterson Visitors’ Center
00:01:42 during a most unique time in history,
00:01:45 in the midst of a global pandemic.
00:01:49 The brotherhood has demonstrated ‘a heart for the work’
00:01:52 through contributions
00:01:55 and brothers and sisters offering their skills
00:01:57 —some of which are quite unique.
00:02:00 It’s so encouraging to see
00:02:02 how Jehovah has come to our aid
00:02:04 with supply issues
00:02:06 and how Bethel departments have cooperated
00:02:09 and provided skilled people to help us.
00:02:11 It’s been so encouraging.
00:02:14 All involved have seen Jehovah’s hand guiding the way
00:02:16 through these challenging circumstances.
00:02:19 But some may wonder,
00:02:21 ‘At a time when guests are not allowed on Bethel property,
00:02:24 why is this visitors’ center so important to Jehovah?’
00:02:29 The physical buildings at Bethel are attractive,
00:02:33 but what’s more valuable to Jehovah is what happens inside.
00:02:37 It’s the spiritual gift that he has in store
00:02:40 for all who come to visit that is so important.
00:02:44 The Patterson Visitors’ Center is designed
00:02:46 to be an immersive theocratic experience for everyone.
00:03:04 The Patterson Visitors’ Center
00:03:06 will feature three museums and a coin display.
00:03:10 Our feature museum will be a first-century Bible village.
00:03:20 The objective is to educate visitors
00:03:23 about what life was like in the first century
00:03:26 and thereby bring Bible accounts to life.
00:03:30 You will get a sense of what things were like
00:03:33 when Jesus walked the earth.
00:03:36 Since the Israelites lived off the land,
00:03:39 the experience begins
00:03:41 with an overview of the annual crop cycles
00:03:44 that formed the core of so much of their daily activities.
00:03:49 Key agricultural tasks, such as threshing,
00:03:52 winnowing, and grinding grain,
00:03:54 will be illustrated
00:03:56 with interactive displays.
00:04:00 We know you will find the exhibit components,
00:04:03 like the functioning olive press and wine press,
00:04:06 very interesting and informative.
00:04:23 The next stop will be a typical first-century market.
00:04:28 Here you will see some of the food and goods
00:04:31 that would have been available
00:04:33 depending on the season of the year.
00:04:37 We next invite you into the residence and workshop spaces
00:04:40 of a typical first-century Israelite family.
00:04:44 The manger,
00:04:48 carpentry shop,
00:04:49 weaving and fabric dying displays
00:04:52 will illustrate a number of Israelite activities.
00:04:56 The residence courtyard area
00:04:58 will show other regular home tasks
00:05:01 like grain grinding and basket making.
00:05:05 We next invite you
00:05:07 into a typical Israelite home
00:05:09 and out onto a rooftop
00:05:11 overlooking the rest of the village.
00:05:16 Before you leave the residences,
00:05:18 you will also see an upper room
00:05:20 that would have been in some of the Israelite homes.
00:05:26 The next area of the first-century Bible village
00:05:29 that you can explore is the synagogue,
00:05:35 which was the center of worship and study in the Jewish community.
00:05:40 Next, a functioning pottery wheel and kiln
00:05:43 will illustrate how pottery was made.
00:05:46 The last stop will take you to a lakeside
00:05:49 where you will be able to board a first-century fishing boat
00:05:53 similar to the one that Jesus and his disciples used.
00:05:58 Here you can learn what was involved in commercial fishing.
00:06:18 This and so much more
00:06:21 is waiting for you
00:06:22 at the new Patterson Visitors’ Center.
00:06:26 We can’t wait for you to come and see
00:06:29 the beautiful spiritual gift that is waiting for you!
00:06:42 The new visitors’ center and museum are on course to be completed
00:06:45 in the fall of 2023.
00:06:48 When will guests be able to come back to Bethel and tour the new facility?
00:06:53 We are going to have to wait and see.
00:06:56 But one thing is for sure:
00:06:58 When the doors finally do open,
00:07:00 anyone who makes the effort to come
00:07:02 will receive a spiritual gift from Jehovah.
00:07:06 The touring experience will prove to be a spiritual encouragement
00:07:10 to the worldwide brotherhood
00:07:12 and promote pure worship
00:07:14 to Jehovah’s praise and honor in a very unique way.
00:07:18 It will certainly be a must-see.
00:07:22 Well, we’ve seen the blessings on this project
00:07:24 and, really, all the people working hard on it.
00:07:27 The facility is going to benefit thousands of future visitors.
00:07:32 It’s because all of us,
00:07:34 either now or in the new world,
00:07:36 need to be taught about the life and ministry of Jesus.
00:07:39 For this reason, we’re convinced
00:07:41 of Jehovah’s blessing on the project
00:07:43 and his desire to have this facility built.
00:07:46 It’s Jehovah’s desire that people come to his house
00:07:49 and be refreshed and educated.
00:07:52 It is our prayer that this new and thrilling visitors’ center
00:07:57 will accomplish that.
00:07:59 Guests will come, they will be upbuilt,
00:08:02 and they will draw closer to Jehovah God.
