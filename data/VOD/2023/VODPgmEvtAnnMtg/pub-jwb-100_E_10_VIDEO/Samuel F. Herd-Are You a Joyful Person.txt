00:00:01 When you think of your brain,
00:00:04 view it as a box that contains all sorts of information
00:00:09 —good and bad.
00:00:11 When you think of your heart,
00:00:13 view it as a bottle
00:00:15 that contains only good information.
00:00:19 Now listen to this vintage, old, 1950’s
00:00:24 Joy dishwashing liquid soap commercial:
00:00:28 “Joy in a bottle beats anything in a box.”
00:00:34 True joy from the heart
00:00:37 beats a head full of knowledge.
00:00:42 What about it?
00:00:44 Are you a joyful person?
00:00:47 What good is it?
00:00:49 Well, the Bible says:
00:00:51 “A joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance.”
00:00:55 And it goes on to say:
00:00:57 “A heart that is joyful does good to the body.”
00:01:04 How does this work?
00:01:07 At times, your heart will make you smile
00:01:11 when your body is in pain.
00:01:14 For example, you pass another person
00:01:18 and he or she says, “How are you?”
00:01:21 You smile and say, “Good.”
00:01:25 Your back, feet, and legs are killing you,
00:01:30 but your heart won’t let you give a negative answer.
00:01:36 There are other more important reasons to be joyful.
00:01:41 Here’s one: Jehovah is a joyful person.
00:01:47 At 1 Timothy 1:11,
00:01:52 he is called “the happy God.”
00:01:54 Now, a synonym is the “joyful” God.
00:02:00 He rejoices in his work.
00:02:03 Well, how do we know that?
00:02:05 Well, look at the 104th Psalm
00:02:08 and verse 31:
00:02:11 “The glory of Jehovah will last forever.
00:02:16 Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”
00:02:21 “Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”
00:02:25 Synonyms are having “joy, or delight,”
00:02:29 in his works.
00:02:32 Now, secondly, Jesus too is a happy worker.
00:02:38 At 1 Timothy chapter 6,
00:02:40 and verses 14 and 15,
00:02:43 he’s called “the happy . . . Potentate.”
00:02:48 Potentate is a powerful ruler.
00:02:51 Yet, he is happy.
00:02:54 It was prophesied of him
00:02:56 at Psalm 40:8:
00:03:00 “To do your will, O my God,
00:03:03 is my delight.”
00:03:08 Now, this means “to please greatly.”
00:03:13 According to John 4:34,
00:03:17 the doing of God’s work was food for him.
00:03:21 It energized him and sustained him.
00:03:26 Doing God’s will was like butter on his bread
00:03:29 and milk in his glass.
00:03:33 Jehovah wants us to rejoice in our work.
00:03:39 Read with me, please,
00:03:41 Ecclesiastes 5:19:
00:03:46 “Also, when the true God gives a man
00:03:50 “riches and material possessions
00:03:53 “along with the ability to enjoy them,
00:03:57 “he should take his reward
00:04:00 “and rejoice in his hard work.
00:04:04 This is the gift of God.”
00:04:08 Housewives and mothers,
00:04:10 rejoice in your work.
00:04:13 Husbands and fathers,
00:04:15 rejoice in your work.
00:04:19 Single men and women,
00:04:21 rejoice in your work.
00:04:25 Widows and widowers,
00:04:28 rejoice in your work.
00:04:31 Old folks,
00:04:33 rejoice in whatever you’re able to do
00:04:37 —just call it work.
00:04:40 Jehovah wants us to be joyful.
00:04:45 Deuteronomy 16:15
00:04:48 comments this way:
00:04:50 “Jehovah your God will bless . . .
00:04:54 “all that you do,
00:04:56 and you will become nothing but joyful.”
00:05:00 The best fathers are happy fathers.
00:05:04 The best husbands are happy husbands.
00:05:08 The best mothers are happy mothers.
00:05:12 The best children are obedient children
00:05:15 —oops, I mean are happy children.
00:05:22 Singing upbuilding songs produces joy.
00:05:26 Levite males sang at the temple.
00:05:30 However, other singers (men and women)
00:05:33 are spoken of in Scripture.
00:05:37 At Acts 16:25, it says:
00:05:41 “But about the middle of the night,
00:05:43 “Paul and Silas were praying
00:05:46 “and praising God with song,
00:05:50 and the prisoners were listening to them.”
00:05:54 Slaves used to sing while working.
00:05:57 They did this to pass the time
00:06:00 and lift their spirits to the highest joy.
00:06:04 They sang out their struggle
00:06:08 —weariness, loneliness,
00:06:12 sorrow, hope,
00:06:15 and determination for a better life.
00:06:19 You can sing in the shower,
00:06:23 just make sure no one is listening.
00:06:27 Count your blessings.
00:06:29 Bathe in the joy that they bring you.
00:06:35 Joy is an aspect of God’s holy spirit.
00:06:40 It is the second of the nine aspects
00:06:44 mentioned at Galatians 5:22.
00:06:50 Pray daily for God’s holy spirit to be with you in your life.
00:06:57 Read with me Daniel chapter 6,
00:07:00 and verses 10 and 11:
00:07:02 “But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed,
00:07:07 “he went to his house,
00:07:10 “which had the windows of his roof chamber
00:07:13 “open toward Jerusalem.
00:07:17 “And three times a day
00:07:20 “he got down on his knees
00:07:23 “and prayed
00:07:25 “and offered praise before his God,
00:07:29 “as he had regularly done prior to this.
00:07:34 “At that time those men burst in
00:07:37 “and found Daniel petitioning
00:07:41 and pleading for favor before his God.”
00:07:46 My wife, Gloria, and I
00:07:49 used to get down on our knees
00:07:52 to pray before going to bed.
00:07:55 Now that we’re old, we just sit on the side of the bed and pray.
00:07:59 If we get down, we can’t get up.
00:08:05 Keep in mind that prayer will produce in you joy.
00:08:10 You’re not alone; Jehovah is with you.
00:08:15 He is never far away.
00:08:18 At Acts 17:27,
00:08:21 Paul told some in Athens:
00:08:25 “He is not far off from each one of us.”
00:08:29 He can see you and hear you from heaven,
00:08:34 wherever heaven is located.
00:08:38 Never should we feel that we are alone.
00:08:44 Each minute of every day,
00:08:48 Jehovah is right beside us,
00:08:51 looking for opportunities to help us.
00:08:57 Talk to him regularly.
00:09:00 Ask him to give you joy.
00:09:05 Angels too are joyful.
00:09:07 Luke 15:10 says that they’re joyful.
00:09:12 Please look at it as we read it:
00:09:15 “In the same way, I tell you,
00:09:18 “joy arises among the angels of God
00:09:23 over one sinner who repents.”
00:09:27 What do you think?
00:09:29 Are you a joyful person?
00:09:33 Try to remember the box.
00:09:37 Put your mind to it.
00:09:40 And the bottle—put your heart into it.
00:09:47 Copy as best you can
00:09:49 those who are joyful
00:09:52 —Jehovah, Jesus,
00:09:56 the angels,
00:09:58 your spiritual brothers and sisters.
00:10:02 Pray daily for a joyful countenance.
00:10:06 A warm smile does good to the body.
00:10:13 One secular song makes this point.
00:10:16 I won’t sing it.
00:10:18 I’ll just say it:
00:10:21 “Light up your face with gladness.
00:10:25 “Hide every trace of sadness.
00:10:30 “Although a tear may be ever so near,
00:10:35 “that’s the time you must keep on trying.
00:10:40 “Smile, what’s the use of crying?
00:10:44 “You’ll find that life is still worthwhile
00:10:47 if you just smile.”
00:10:53 If you are a joyful person, thank Jehovah.
00:10:59 If you are lacking joy, work on being more joyful.
00:11:05 Remember,
00:11:07 Jehovah wants you to be
00:11:10 nothing but joyful.
00:11:14 Let’s make it our aim
00:11:16 to please him with joy.
