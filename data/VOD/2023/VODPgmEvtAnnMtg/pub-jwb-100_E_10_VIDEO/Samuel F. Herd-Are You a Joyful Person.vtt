When you think of your brain,

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:09.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
view it as a box that contains
all sorts of information

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
—good and bad.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think of your heart,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:15.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
view it as a bottle

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
that contains only good information.

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:24.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now listen to this vintage, old, 1950’s

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:27.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy dishwashing liquid soap commercial:

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Joy in a bottle beats anything in a box.”

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
True joy from the heart

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:40.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
beats a head full of knowledge.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about it?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a joyful person?

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
What good is it?

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible says:

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A joyful heart
makes for a cheerful countenance.”

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it goes on to say:

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A heart that is joyful
does good to the body.”

00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:06.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this work?

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times,
your heart will make you smile

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
when your body is in pain.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:18.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
you pass another person

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he or she says, “How are you?”

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
You smile and say, “Good.”

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:30.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your back, feet, and legs are killing you,

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:35.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
but your heart
won’t let you give a negative answer.

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:41.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are other more important reasons
to be joyful.

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:45.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one:
Jehovah is a joyful person.

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:52.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Timothy 1:11,

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is called “the happy God.”

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:59.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a synonym is the “joyful” God.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rejoices in his work.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we know that?

00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:08.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at the 104th Psalm

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 31:

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:16.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Synonyms are having “joy, or delight,”

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his works.

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, secondly,
Jesus too is a happy worker.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Timothy chapter 6,

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:43.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 14 and 15,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s called “the happy . . . Potentate.”

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Potentate is a powerful ruler.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he is happy.

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:56.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was prophesied of him

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 40:8:

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To do your will, O my God,

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
is my delight.”

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:13.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this means “to please greatly.”

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to John 4:34,

00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:21.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doing of God’s work was food for him.

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:26.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
It energized him and sustained him.

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing God’s will was like butter on his bread

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and milk in his glass.

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:37.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to rejoice in our work.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:41.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me, please,

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:45.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 5:19:

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:50.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, when the true God gives a man

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:53.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“riches and material possessions

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with the ability to enjoy them,

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he should take his reward

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and rejoice in his hard work.

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the gift of God.”

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Housewives and mothers,

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Husbands and fathers,

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:17.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:21.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Single men and women,

00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:28.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Widows and widowers,

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:31.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:33.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Old folks,

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in whatever you’re able to do

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just call it work.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to be joyful.

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:48.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 16:15

00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:50.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
comments this way:

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah your God will bless . . .

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all that you do,

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will become nothing but joyful.”

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best fathers are happy fathers.

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:08.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best husbands are happy husbands.

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best mothers are happy mothers.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best children are obedient children

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
—oops, I mean are happy children.

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:26.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Singing upbuilding songs produces joy.

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Levite males sang at the temple.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, other singers (men and women)

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:37.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
are spoken of in Scripture.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 16:25, it says:

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:43.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But about the middle of the night,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul and Silas were praying

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:50.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and praising God with song,

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:53.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prisoners were listening to them.”

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slaves used to sing while working.

00:05:57.874 --> 00:06:00.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did this to pass the time

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:04.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lift their spirits to the highest joy.

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:08.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sang out their struggle

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:12.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
—weariness, loneliness,

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
sorrow, hope,

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:18.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and determination for a better life.

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can sing in the shower,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
just make sure no one is listening.

00:06:27.203 --> 00:06:29.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Count your blessings.

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:32.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bathe in the joy that they bring you.

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:38.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy is an aspect of God’s holy spirit.

00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:44.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the second of the nine aspects

00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:48.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Galatians 5:22.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray daily for God’s holy spirit
to be with you in your life.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me Daniel chapter 6,

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 10 and 11:

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:07.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But as soon as Daniel knew
that the decree had been signed,

00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:10.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he went to his house,

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which had the windows of his roof chamber

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“open toward Jerusalem.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And three times a day

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:23.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he got down on his knees

00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and prayed

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:29.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and offered praise before his God,

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:34.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he had regularly done prior to this.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time those men burst in

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:41.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and found Daniel petitioning

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:45.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pleading for favor before his God.”

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:49.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife, Gloria, and I

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to get down on our knees

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pray before going to bed.

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:59.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we’re old,
we just sit on the side of the bed and pray.

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:02.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we get down, we can’t get up.

00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:08.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind
that prayer will produce in you joy.

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:15.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not alone;
Jehovah is with you.

00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is never far away.

00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:21.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 17:27,

00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul told some in Athens:

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:28.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is not far off from each one of us.”

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:34.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can see you
and hear you from heaven,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever heaven is located.

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:43.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never should we feel that we are alone.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each minute of every day,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is right beside us,

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for opportunities to help us.

00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to him regularly.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask him to give you joy.

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:07.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Angels too are joyful.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:12.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 15:10 says that they’re joyful.

00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:14.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please look at it as we read it:

00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:18.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the same way, I tell you,

00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:23.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“joy arises among the angels of God

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:26.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
over one sinner who repents.”

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:29.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a joyful person?

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:37.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to remember the box.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put your mind to it.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the bottle—put your heart into it.

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:49.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Copy as best you can

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are joyful

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:56.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah, Jesus,

00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:58.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angels,

00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:02.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray daily for a joyful countenance.

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
A warm smile does good to the body.

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:16.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
One secular song makes this point.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t sing it.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll just say it:

00:10:21.137 --> 00:10:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Light up your face with gladness.

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:30.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hide every trace of sadness.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:35.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although a tear may be ever so near,

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:40.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that’s the time you must keep on trying.

00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:44.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Smile, what’s the use of crying?

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:47.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ll find that life is still worthwhile

00:10:47.863 --> 00:10:51.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you just smile.”

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:58.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are a joyful person,
thank Jehovah.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are lacking joy,
work on being more joyful.

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you to be

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:14.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
nothing but joyful.

00:11:14.023 --> 00:11:16.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s make it our aim

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:19.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
to please him with joy.
