00:00:01.147 --> 00:00:04.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
One hundred years ago,
when our brothers and sisters were invited

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:08.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the 1922 Cedar Point, Ohio, convention,

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:11.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were very excited.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, just three years earlier,

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:19.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had been energized
by a newly organized approach

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:21.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the good news of the Kingdom.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:27.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students’ convention in 1919
launched a door-to-door campaign

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain subscriptions
to the newly released <i>Golden Age</i>  magazine.

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:35.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later that year,
a Service Director was appointed

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each group of Bible Students.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they had clear direction

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
in following Jesus’ command to preach.

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
That convention was considered
by many who were there

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be “the greatest ever held”
up to that time.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
So imagine their anticipation

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:58.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the announcement was made
of another convention in 1922!

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:00.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would it bring?

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would there be other exciting announcements?

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.841 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everywhere around the grounds,

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.467 line:10% position:50% align:center
you’d see the big capital letters

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.763 line:10% position:50% align:center
ADV, ADV, ADV.

00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:11.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody thought, ‘What is ADV?’

00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:14.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many were guessing this and guessing that.

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:17.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Behold, the King reigns!

00:01:18.564 --> 00:01:21.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are his publicity agents.

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:26.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore advertise,

00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:28.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertise,

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:32.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertise, the King and his Kingdom.

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:40.046 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well there wasn’t a dry eye in the audience.

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.048 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everybody was crying.

00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:44.258 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everybody was waving their handkerchiefs

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:48.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking to whoever was sitting by
whether they knew them or not.

00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:51.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now more than just Bible students,

00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:55.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were becoming
an organization of preachers.

00:01:55.437 --> 00:01:59.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would the call to ‘advertise the King
and his Kingdom’ lead to?

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:05.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
What unique and innovative methods
would Jehovah’s people use?

00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:09.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next 100 years would tell the story.

00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:15.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1922,
J.F. Rutherford began using

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:18.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
the new technology of radio broadcasting

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach a global audience
with the Kingdom message.

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:23.426 line:10% position:50% align:center
At its peak in 1933,

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:25.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
radio broadcasts originating

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:29.224 line:10% position:50% align:center
from our own WBBR studios in New York

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
were carried by 408 radio stations
on six continents.

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of clergy interference,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
the commercial radio industry
gradually denied access to the airwaves.

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did opposition stop Jehovah’s people

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
from advertising the Kingdom good news?

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:52.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
What additional preaching methods were used?

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:57.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
A unified, consistent message
about the Kingdom was achieved

00:02:57.838 --> 00:03:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the use of testimony cards
in several languages.

00:03:02.218 --> 00:03:05.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
A publisher would simply hand the card
to the householder

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:08.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask him to read the brief Bible message.

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:11.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another exciting application of technology

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:14.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the use of the portable phonograph

00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:16.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
for house-to-house preaching.

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:18.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
To expand this initiative,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1937 at the Columbus, Ohio, convention,

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
the special pioneer work was introduced.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Special pioneers were encouraged
to use the phonograph,

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:31.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only when invited into a house,

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:33.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at every house.

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the 1939 service year,

00:03:37.047 --> 00:03:40.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
300 special pioneers set up the phonographs

00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
over half a million times,

00:03:42.428 --> 00:03:44.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
playing the prerecorded,

00:03:44.472 --> 00:03:47.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
four-and-half-minute talks
by Brother Rutherford

00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:49.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
to over one million listeners!

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:53.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other Kingdom publishers
thus became “phonograph-minded,”

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:57.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually,
over 47,000 portable phonographs

00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
with records covering 92 topics

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
trumpeted the Kingdom message.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Determined to preach from the housetops,

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
zealous Kingdom publishers
amplified their ministry

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:12.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
with transcription machines that broadcast

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford’s full-length,
prerecorded lectures.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
A transcription machine was a phonograph

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:22.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipped with powered loudspeakers.

00:04:22.013 --> 00:04:26.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made possible
sound cars and sound boats.

00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:31.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom message
was clearly heard on rivers, on streets,

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:34.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
in parks and squares, in rented halls,

00:04:34.818 --> 00:04:38.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
theaters, and other public spaces.

00:04:38.114 --> 00:04:42.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Equipped with tracts, booklets,
magazines, and books,

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:45.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
thousands of volunteers participated

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:49.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
in special preaching
and literature distribution campaigns.

00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:52.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
These special campaigns made it possible

00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:55.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cover large areas
with the Kingdom message quickly,

00:04:55.382 --> 00:04:57.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the face of opposition.

00:04:58.094 --> 00:05:00.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Street work,

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
information marches,
and bicycle parades

00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:07.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
boldly brought the Kingdom message
directly before the eyes of the public.

00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:09.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marches ranged in size

00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:13.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
from just a few publishers
to about 1,000 publishers.

00:05:13.277 --> 00:05:15.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Streams of Kingdom publishers

00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:20.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
made their way through the business districts
of large cities.

00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:24.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wore placards bearing a slogan,
carried signs,

00:05:24.247 --> 00:05:26.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
or distributed handbills

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:29.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the title of the featured talk
at a public meeting.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
While radio broadcasts
and information marches

00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
were an efficient way
of reaching mass audiences,

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:38.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
was it the most effective way?

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:41.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our primary method of preaching,

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:44.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
the personal door-to-door ministry,

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:48.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
has proved over time
to be the most effective method

00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:50.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
of advertising the Kingdom.

00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:54.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was preaching all that was needed?

00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:57.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
It became apparent that teaching others

00:05:57.408 --> 00:05:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to observe all the things Jesus commanded’

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
would require training.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kingdom evangelizers needed to be trained

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:08.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use the Bible effectively
and to study it with interested ones.

00:06:08.712 --> 00:06:12.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at the “Call to Action” Assembly in 1943,

00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:16.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new congregation meeting
was announced and demonstrated.

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:20.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was called
the <i>Course in Theocratic Ministry, </i>

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it accompanied
the weekly Service Meeting.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:26.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, textbooks were released

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help our brothers
cultivate their teaching skills.

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
The books <i>Theocratic Aid</i>  published in 1945

00:06:33.072 --> 00:06:36.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided clear guidance
for improved public speaking,

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
effective door-to-door witnessing,

00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:40.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
making meaningful return visits,

00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:43.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conducting progressive Bible studies,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
while <i>Equipped for Every Good Work</i> 
released in 1946

00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:50.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
laid a solid foundation of Bible truth

00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:55.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
through an in-depth
book-by-book examination of God’s Word.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Preachers were learning to become teachers.

00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:02.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such high-quality training

00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:06.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipped more to join
the ranks of Kingdom proclaimers.

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:09.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for those who were already active,

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:12.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
training allowed them
to expand their participation.

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:15.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ranks of Kingdom publishers swelled.

00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:18.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the same time,

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:22.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
began training Kingdom proclaimers

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:25.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take up missionary work in lands

00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:28.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there were few, if any,
Kingdom publishers.

00:07:28.423 --> 00:07:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the years since,
thousands of trained missionaries

00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:36.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
have ‘advertised the King and his Kingdom’
to the ends of the earth.

00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:40.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, the teaching tools
provided by the faithful slave

00:07:40.395 --> 00:07:44.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
have steadily adapted to changing needs.

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:47.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study publications such as <i>“Let God Be True,” </i>

00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:50.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</i>

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now, 

00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:55.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course</i>

00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:59.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
have proved to be
extremely effective teaching tools.

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:05.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huge international conventions
with record-breaking attendances

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
have generated global headlines

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertising Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:11.303 --> 00:08:16.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Films, DVDs, and JW Broadcasting videos

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
have helped
prospective subjects of the Kingdom

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
visualize the realities of that Kingdom.

00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:26.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
