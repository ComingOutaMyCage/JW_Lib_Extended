00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:04.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
In four of his letters,

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul encouraged fellow Christians

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “greet one another with a holy kiss.”

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:15.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Peter used the expression

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:19.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“greet one another with a kiss of love.”

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why was that encouragement given?

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because giving a kiss

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a token of affection, honor, or peace.

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:32.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar vein,

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:36.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Jehovah commands us to do

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 2, please.

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:41.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go to the second Psalm,

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 12.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says: “Honor

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or, if you look at the footnote,
literally, “Kiss”

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:53.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—kiss] the son,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or God will become indignant

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will perish from the way,

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:04.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
for His [Jehovah’s] anger flares up quickly.”

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice that Jehovah
doesn’t present this as an option, does he?

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t say,
‘I recommend, or suggest, you kiss my son.’

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s actually presented as a decree

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a powerful statement indeed.

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:22.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah takes it very personally

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we warmly, affectionately

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
welcome his Son or not, see?

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:32.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who do not do so

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:36.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
—do not kiss the Son
and warmly welcome him—

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:41.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
will perish as a result of Jehovah’s anger.

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:43.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or, put another way,

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:47.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
such ones ‘will meet God.’

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:50.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s talk
about this just for a little bit.

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:53.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites,
because they were so disobedient,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
were warned by Jehovah
through Amos the prophet

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Amos 4:12:

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get ready to meet your God.”

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:06.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that expression reminds me

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
of when I was a young teenager

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
growing up
in the southern part of the United States.

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along the highways, we would
often see billboards, religious billboards.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a common sign read:

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:21.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you ready to meet God?”

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:25.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was supposed
to be based on Amos 4:12.

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we asked, and it was explained
to us that the meaning was,

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:31.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you ready to go to heaven,

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“meet God face-to-face,

00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereafter live in heaven?”

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “meet”

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being used with a favorable connotation.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:46.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we indicated,
that’s not the meaning of Amos 4:12

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:50.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not to get ready to introduce yourself
to God in a friendly way—

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:53.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
far from it.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah through Amos
was warning those disobedient Israelites

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they were going to meet God

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of a head-on collision.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was going to be similar

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a little ant walking on a train rail,

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking south and being met
by a locomotive coming north.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:15.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the Israelites would experience.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, sure enough,
as Jehovah warned some years later,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Israelites “met God”

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they received his adverse judgment

00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Assyria conquered and devastated them.

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:33.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
What get-ready-to-meet-your-God message

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:39.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being sounded by God’s people today?

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:44.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s true that we sound
“the good news of the Kingdom.”

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:47.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also sound
a warning message, don’t we?

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warn that all who do not take
a stand with Jehovah

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:56.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and walk with him
but continue to walk in opposition

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
will meet him in a head-on collision.

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s another question:

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen in the near future

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and we’ve learned 
during the great tribulation)

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the tone
—the tenor—

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:15.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our get-ready-to-meet-your-God
warning message?

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:18.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for the answer,
let’s go to Revelation chapter 16

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 16.

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, please, let’s read verse 21:

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:30.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then great hailstones,

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each about the weight of a talent,

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fell from heaven on the people,

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:38.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the people blasphemed God

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:41.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of the plague of hail,

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:45.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the plague was unusually great.”

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our publications have explained

00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:50.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
that, of course, right now

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
we take the “soft” waters of truth to people,

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
encouraging them to turn to Jehovah.

00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But soon during the great tribulation,

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:04.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tone, the tenor, will turn “hard.”

00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:06.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will announce the imminent end

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Satan’s entire wicked system.

00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:14.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
The soft waters of truth will congeal

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become
the hard-hitting hailstones of truth.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this message will be so powerful

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:25.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
that, as indicated
there in that scripture we read,

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:29.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people will blaspheme God.

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:30.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be very upset.

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:32.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be very disturbed.

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s likened to a great hailstone,

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
with every hailstone

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
(a great hailstorm,
I should say, with every hailstone)

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
weighing about a talent.

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Revelation Climax </i> book said

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if the apostle John
had in mind the Greek talent,

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would mean each hailstone
would weigh about 45 pounds (20 kg).

00:05:56.806 --> 00:06:01.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some years ago, interestingly,
there was a little article, or little account,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
in <i>The Watchtower</i>  about egg-sized hail

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
falling in China,

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:12.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
killing 25 people
and wounding 200 additional people.

00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:13.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about it.

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
If hailstones
weighing only ounces could do that,

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:22.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
what about 45-pound hailstones

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and especially
if you factor in how fast they fall)?

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:30.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Experts say a large hailstone

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
can fall at speeds

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:36.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
faster than 100 miles an hour (160 km/hr).

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly, not long ago 

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:43.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> made
the comment that it could well be

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our hailstone message
that we’re commissioned to give

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:51.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be what induces Gog of Magog

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:55.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make his all-out attack
against Jehovah’s people

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:59.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the intention
of wiping them from the earth.

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
we know the attack of Gog is the event

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:05.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will enrage Jehovah

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:08.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move him to bring on

00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:11.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rescue operation of Armageddon.

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:17.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
But right now we’re still
in the kiss-God’s-Son invitation time period.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy about that, right?

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t get too comfortable
with that message either.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:29.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
We entreat honesthearted ones

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
to honor God’s Son

00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to warmly welcome him 
as earth’s new ruler.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do this urgently
—don’t we?—

00:07:38.407 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time before that hard-hitting,

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
get-ready-to-meet-your-God
time period arrives.

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:49.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a very important question:

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we motivated

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:54.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kiss God’s Son only because we don’t want

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:59.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
to experience the adverse consequences
of not doing so?

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:04.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, our main motivator is love, isn’t it?

00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:07.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love Jehovah,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love his dear Son,

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:13.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we long for him to be earth’s new ruler.

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:17.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
That love is what
mainly motivates us to do so,

00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:20.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kiss—welcome—God’s Son.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:24.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, we want to help
honesthearted ones as we teach them

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:26.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
to likewise kiss God’s Son

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are motivated by love.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus is Jehovah’s choice, isn’t he?

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has selected him

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has installed him as King of the Kingdom,

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will be the absolute best ruler

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:45.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans could ever have.

00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:46.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:50.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will make Jesus the very best ruler?

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one thing:
He will have superhuman abilities,

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will demonstrate and will have these
during his Thousand Year Reign.

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:04.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will make him a wonderful,
very loving ruler.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, let’s identify

00:09:06.062 --> 00:09:08.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
six superhuman abilities

00:09:08.698 --> 00:09:11.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will possess and demonstrate

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:14.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
during his wonderful Thousand Year Reign.

00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:19.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to identify each
of these six superhuman abilities,

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:24.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to use a miracle
that Jesus performed here on the earth,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know
the earthly miracles portend, or foreshadow,

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
even greater miracles

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
during his time as Messianic King.

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:36.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now turn, please, to Mark chapter 4,

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s identify

00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
superhuman ability number one.

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:46.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark 4:37 says:

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now a great violent windstorm broke out,

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:56.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the waves kept crashing into the boat,

00:09:56.012 --> 00:10:00.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the boat was close to being swamped.

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he [Jesus] was in the stern,

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sleeping on the pillow.

00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:08.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they woke him up and said to him:

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Teacher, do you not care
that we are about to perish?’

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that he got up and rebuked the wind

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to the sea:

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Hush! Be quiet!’

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:28.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the wind abated,
and a great calm set in.”

00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:30.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did you notice that that windstorm

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
is described with a double adjective

00:10:33.983 --> 00:10:36.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“great violent windstorm”—

00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:39.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating its ferocity?

00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with three simple words

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:43.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“Hush! Be quiet!”—

00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus completely calmed both wind and sea.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what does that miracle
portend for the future?

00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:54.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as Messianic King,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will have the power

00:10:56.672 --> 00:11:00.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
to command and control the wind, the sea

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actually, all forces of nature—

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
to mankind’s benefit.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under Kingdom rule,
there will be no destructive tsunamis,

00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:14.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,

00:11:14.824 --> 00:11:17.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
earthquakes, etcetera, etcetera.

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:23.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s identify
superhuman ability number two.

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to do this,
just think about the account, if you will,

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:29.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Matthew chapter 14.

00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:33.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you recall, with just five loaves of bread

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two little fish,

00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:38.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus fed a crowd,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely of over 10,000 people

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you factor in the women and children.

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every one of them

00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
ate to complete satisfaction.

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, they even “[gathered] up

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
12 baskets full of fragments”

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
as leftovers.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:59.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from this miracle?

00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:02.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, as Messianic King,

00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
will exercise authority

00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:09.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the organic elements
in food and vegetation,

00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensuring that no one

00:12:11.847 --> 00:12:14.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
under his rule ever goes hungry.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is estimated that right now

00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:20.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 800 million people
go to bed at night hungry.

00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:26.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
That number will be reduced to zero

00:12:26.128 --> 00:12:28.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Kingdom rule.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one will have to go
to bed hungry at night.

00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 72:16 says:

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.”

00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it won’t be just basics.

00:12:43.412 --> 00:12:45.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 25:6 says:

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:49.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies
will make for all the peoples

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:53.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that means nobody is left out
—for all the peoples]

00:12:53.923 --> 00:12:57.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a banquet of rich dishes,

00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:02.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
a banquet of fine wine, . . . filtered wine.”

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re not talking about Ripple
or Thunderbird wine here.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re talking about fine wine,

00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Jesus made
at that wedding feast in Cana.

00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:23.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s identify
superhuman ability number three.

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:26.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go, please, to Matthew chapter 15

00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:28.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 15—

00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:33.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read,
please, verse number 30:

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:38.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then large crowds approached him,

00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:42.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
“bringing along people who were lame,

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“maimed, blind, speechless, and many others,

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they laid them at his feet,

00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:52.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he cured them.”

00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:55.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was amazing, wasn’t it?

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:59.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did these healing miracles portend

00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jesus as Messianic King?

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he will have the power

00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the authority to heal

00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:12.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
all sicknesses and maladies.

00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:17.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, any sickness, any malady,
he will heal under Kingdom rule,

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:19.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
as promised at Isaiah 33:24:

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:23.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident [not one]

00:14:23.212 --> 00:14:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:31.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus will even have the power
to put the human aging process

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
into reverse with ones becoming

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
young physically.

00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall this video clip?

00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was shown at a convention

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:46.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
some years ago.

00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:48.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re not seeing in this

00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:53.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
portion of this video a fantasy. 

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re looking at reality.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:01.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one brother said:
“Can you imagine getting up in the morning?

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:04.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You put your glasses on,
and you can’t see anything!

00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:07.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everything is blurry.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take them off,
and now you can see beautifully!”

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:15.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not fantasy—we’re talking about reality

00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:18.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s new world.

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s identify
superhuman ability number four.

00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:26.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to do this, just think, if you will,
of the account in Mark chapter 5.

00:15:27.476 --> 00:15:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you recall, very sadly

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
—heart-wrenchingly—

00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little 12-year-old girl had died.

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:39.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus do?

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:42.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account tells us
he took her hand and said:

00:15:42.224 --> 00:15:46.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Little girl, I say to you, get up!”

00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:50.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
That girl who had been dead immediately rose

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:52.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began walking.

00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what future accomplishment
is signified by this miracle?

00:15:57.406 --> 00:16:01.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus and his 144,000 associate kings

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:03.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have the power

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:07.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
to completely empty the grave,

00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:10.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
the common grave of dead mankind,

00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:12.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the resurrection.

00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, according to Revelation 20:14,

00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:18.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
the empty “Grave”

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be thrown
into the symbolic “lake of fire.”

00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:24.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be abolished forever,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
never again to receive another occupant.

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:34.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s isolate
superhuman ability number five

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Matthew chapter 9, please.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn there.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 9

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:47.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read beginning
in verse number 3—Matthew 9:3:

00:16:48.057 --> 00:16:51.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now certain scribes said to themselves:

00:16:51.894 --> 00:16:54.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This fellow is blaspheming.’

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said:

00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:03.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why are you thinking
wicked things in your hearts?’”

00:17:04.006 --> 00:17:08.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice that Jesus
could read hearts there as a perfect human.

00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:11.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about as a Messianic King?

00:17:11.547 --> 00:17:13.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even more so.

00:17:13.048 --> 00:17:17.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and the 144,000
will be able to read hearts.

00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:19.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that means what?

00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:22.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be able to perfectly judge mankind

00:17:22.224 --> 00:17:26.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
with absolutely no mistakes

00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:28.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
—amazing indeed!

00:17:28.063 --> 00:17:32.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s determine one more,
a sixth superhuman,

00:17:32.701 --> 00:17:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
miraculous ability that Jesus
will possess and demonstrate.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to do this.

00:17:38.373 --> 00:17:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Matthew chapter 8,

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:42.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
just back a little bit
from where you were there

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 8:16:

00:17:47.616 --> 00:17:50.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But after it became evening,

00:17:50.452 --> 00:17:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“people brought him

00:17:52.721 --> 00:17:56.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“many demon-possessed ones;

00:17:56.425 --> 00:18:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he expelled the spirits with a word,

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:03.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he cured all who were suffering.”

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:07.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice, rather than risk a decisive test

00:18:07.136 --> 00:18:09.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the power that was backing Jesus,

00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:12.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
the demons obeyed his command

00:18:12.474 --> 00:18:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
to release these people
that they were possessing.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from this?

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:21.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this prefigure?

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:24.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus and the 144,000

00:18:24.086 --> 00:18:27.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have the power to act

00:18:27.756 --> 00:18:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Satan and his demons,

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:32.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus even granted on the earth

00:18:32.494 --> 00:18:35.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
his disciples that same authority, didn’t he?

00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:37.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were able to expel demons.

00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:40.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they will certainly have the power,
even more so,

00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:43.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take action against Satan and his demons

00:18:43.639 --> 00:18:46.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of the thousand years.

00:18:46.308 --> 00:18:48.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end
of the great tribulation (I should say),

00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:52.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
first they will abyss them.

00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then at the end of the final test,
at the end of the thousand years,

00:18:57.286 --> 00:19:02.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, joined by
the secondary seed of Abraham,

00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:05.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
as promised at Genesis 3:15,

00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
(Jesus) will crush

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:11.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ugliest head in the universe,

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:14.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan’s head.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:16.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he will crush

00:19:16.805 --> 00:19:21.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
the second-ugliest heads in the universe,
the heads of the demons.

00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tremendous accomplishment

00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:27.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and vindication
of Jehovah’s name and sovereignty

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:28.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be!

00:19:28.984 --> 00:19:31.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have six marvelous,

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
miraculous, superhuman abilities

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:39.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will possess
and exercise during his reign.

00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:42.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Human rulers, if we think about it,

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:46.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
couldn’t even dream to ever possess

00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:50.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
even one of those superhuman abilities.

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:52.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus will be able to

00:19:52.241 --> 00:19:56.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) command and control the forces of nature

00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:58.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the benefit of all humans;

00:19:58.647 --> 00:20:02.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) exercise authority
over food and vegetation,

00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:06.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensuring that no one ever goes hungry;

00:20:06.088 --> 00:20:10.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) possess the power
to heal all sicknesses and maladies;

00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:15.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) have the capability
to completely empty the grave

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:18.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the resurrection;

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
(5) possess the ability

00:20:21.837 --> 00:20:24.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
to perfectly judge humans

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:27.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
with absolutely no mistakes;

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:30.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (6) be empowered

00:20:30.345 --> 00:20:34.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
to act against Satan and his demons.

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:37.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it, the foregoing

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:42.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
are only a few examples
of the superhuman royal power that Jesus

00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:45.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
will possess as Messianic King.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder he’s Jehovah’s choice!

00:20:49.131 --> 00:20:53.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no wonder
Jehovah has issued the decree

00:20:53.535 --> 00:20:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all—not optional, all— must kiss,

00:20:57.406 --> 00:20:59.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
warmly welcome, his Son.

00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:03.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true that a kiss
can be hypocritical, can’t it?

00:21:04.246 --> 00:21:08.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Absalom gave off, or gave out,

00:21:08.617 --> 00:21:12.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
(I’d probably better say gave off)
many hypocritical kisses.

00:21:12.621 --> 00:21:15.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was kissing everybody, wasn’t he?

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hypocritical!

00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:19.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read the account of treacherous Joab,

00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:23.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
who hypocritically kissed Amasa

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
just before he murdered him.

00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:30.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by means of a disgusting,

00:21:30.472 --> 00:21:34.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
hypocritical, “tender kiss,”

00:21:34.443 --> 00:21:37.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judas betrayed Jesus.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:42.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, brothers and sisters,
our “kiss of Jesus” is not hypocritical.

00:21:42.484 --> 00:21:44.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the bottom of our heart

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
—by our conduct, by our words—

00:21:48.123 --> 00:21:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
we warmly welcome
Jehovah’s choice, don’t we?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so happy,
and we tell everybody about this,

00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he is already installed as King

00:21:58.266 --> 00:22:01.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he will soon
be the Ruler of all the earth.

00:22:01.937 --> 00:22:06.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to help
honesthearted ones to likewise sincerely,

00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:10.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
affectionately, kiss—welcome—God’s Son.

00:22:10.212 --> 00:22:12.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do this urgently

00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:15.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the limited window of time

00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:19.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this kiss-God’s-Son
invitation time period

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:24.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before the it’s-now-too-late
time period arrives,

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:29.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
when ones will be told:
“Get ready to meet your God.”

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:33.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, sadly,
as we know, the vast majority,

00:22:33.668 --> 00:22:35.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially the rulers,

00:22:35.971 --> 00:22:39.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
will adamantly continue to do so.

00:22:39.374 --> 00:22:43.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we are not like them,
because for these ones,

00:22:43.378 --> 00:22:47.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
the anger of Jehovah and Jesus
will blaze against them.

00:22:47.983 --> 00:22:52.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may Jehovah richly bless you,
dear brothers and sisters,

00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:56.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you continue to affectionately

00:22:56.758 --> 00:23:01.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and warmly welcome Jehovah’s choice

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:03.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as you work hard

00:23:03.365 --> 00:23:07.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help other honesthearted ones
to do the same.
