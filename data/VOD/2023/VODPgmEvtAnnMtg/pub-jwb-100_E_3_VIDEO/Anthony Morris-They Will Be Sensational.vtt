00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in a moment, I’ll explain what

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:07.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be sensational.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, please open your Bibles
to Hebrews chapter 6,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
or find it on your phone or tablet.

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul, here in this letter,

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
is addressing those with the heavenly hope.

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he makes a point here about two things

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:33.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
he covers in verse 17 of Hebrews 6

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:36.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “the promise” and the “oath.”

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:41.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s “impossible for [Jehovah] to lie,”
as verse 18 touches on.

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:45.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is what is connected with this hope

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the ones that have the heavenly hope

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by extension the other sheep.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s infallible.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to happen just as he promised.

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul at least three times

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced shipwreck;
that much we know.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we’ll find out there was more later.

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:11.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what he writes here

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a heart full of experience

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:17.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 19:

00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:19.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have this hope

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:23.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as an anchor for the soul,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
both sure and firm,
and it enters in within the curtain.”

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
The anchor

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s just critical

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:37.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the other sheep
and the anointed

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
have their anchor in shape.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, <i>The Watchtower</i>  just last year,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
February 20, 2021,

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:50.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
on page 30,
mentioned this profound thought:

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:56.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“An anchor stabilizes a ship during a storm

00:01:56.132 --> 00:02:00.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and stops it from drifting onto rocks.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But an anchor is useful
only if the chain that attaches to the ship

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not break. . . .

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
[So] if we lose our faith, we lose our hope.” 

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:17.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  has that profound thought

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of God’s people.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:22.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
For now, we’re facing

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Revelation chapter 21 says
in symbolic language.

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:31.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll turn to Revelation 21,

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is why it’s so critical

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:38.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have this clear about our hope

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:41.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
being the anchor there.

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:45.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 1 of Revelation 21:

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:48.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth;

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the former heaven and the former earth
had passed away,

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:56.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
[now notice]
and the sea is no more.”

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, “the sea is no more.”

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we talking about here?

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:07.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that means that after Armageddon,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no more “sea.”

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:12.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously,
that’s not the literal oceans,

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the seas, there.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:19.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the demon-agitated sea
of wicked mankind

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
—gone.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not gone yet.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like in literal wars,

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
submarines are used to sneak up on ships.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is the same way

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he and his demon horde—

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:42.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he’s going to use any means he can

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to wreck our ship.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:48.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an individual one-on-one with Jehovah.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:49.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know, many of you—

00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:51.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look out to you couples

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:55.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re very close;
you love each other.

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know,

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
your mate
(for those of you who are married)

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:03.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to have this kind of relationship

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:06.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their Father, Jehovah.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:11.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody does unless you’re a toddler.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you’re going to be in God’s hands.

00:04:14.137 --> 00:04:19.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
If your parents are Witnesses,
there’s a good chance you’ll be OK.

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is war.

00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the point.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is war.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not going to get easier

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
until “the sea is no more.”

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:37.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, during these times,
in this war,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
we face stormy seas.

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:43.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes a lot of things,
loss of material things.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:46.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are all kinds
of other storms that come up,

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s connected
with the sea of wicked mankind.

00:04:50.673 --> 00:04:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this one here is the one
that we’re going to emphasize:

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
the death of a loved one

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the death of a loved one.

00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a storm!

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:13.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is when our anchor is essential.

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
As individuals, that anchor is essential.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:23.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never lose your anchor!

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:26.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not saying
you’re not going to be battered

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
or I’m not going to be battered,

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
but don’t lose your anchor.

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:35.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave it to us,

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:38.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Paul made that clear.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a sister wrote in,

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I certainly wouldn’t name her.

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
She may eventually see this program here,

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:51.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I thought it was worth sharing with you.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she was honest and humble about it.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it shows, you know,
God’s people are imperfect.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if you noticed that.

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t say anything, David,
when you come out later.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
So her dad died faithful.

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:15.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s what she admits
before her dad died.

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:17.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says that when she saw others

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
shedding tears after their loved ones died,

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
she thought:

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:25.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why do people cry so much?

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:27.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see them again.’

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:37.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would that comfort you
if you just lost a loved one?

00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:39.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:43.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, her dad died.

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:47.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what she honestly stated,
to her credit,

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:54.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But now I understand.”

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she wept, shed tears.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the loss of a loved one
can be devastating,

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:08.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt about it, an incredible storm.

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:12.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now to our theme, 

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:15.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“</i>They Will Be Sensational!,”

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:17.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is “they”?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are family reunions in the new world.

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:27.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things that are coming. Oh!

00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:30.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go ahead and use your imagination.

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah won’t fault you for that.

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:35.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re going to be sensational!

00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really are.

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:40.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another word for “sensational”

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “astonishing”;

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:46.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
another one is “astounding.”

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:49.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s nice is this is not a fantasy.

00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what’s going to happen.
It’s a reality.

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consider
some families in Bible history.

00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:01.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, we’ll start with Noah.

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was born in 2970 B.C.E.

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
—126 years after Adam’s death.

00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:15.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he didn’t have any interaction with Adam.

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think he got a blessing there, personally.

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:21.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when his father, Lamech,
named him Noah

00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:24.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
(you know, that’s in scripture),

00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said:
‘This one will bring us comfort from our work

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:30.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and from the pain of our hands

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:33.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
resulting from the ground
which Jehovah has cursed.’

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful expression!

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:39.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know Noah lived up to that.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he lived,
he faced materialized angels.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
They left “their . . . proper dwelling place”
and produced offspring

00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those hybrid Nephilim.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ‘the earth became full of violence.’

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:59.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Noah and his family,
they avoided all of that corruption.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he was faultless.
He “walked with the true God.”

00:09:03.593 --> 00:09:08.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he lived up
to what Jehovah expected of him.

00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:11.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
And find Genesis, if you would please,

00:09:11.534 --> 00:09:15.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to look at chapter 8

00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:18.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Genesis chapter 8.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:21.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will mention this here

00:09:24.113 --> 00:09:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the chapter before 8,
which would be chapter 7,

00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:32.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do find the point in verse 13:

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:36.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On that very day, Noah went into the ark

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:40.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with his sons,
Shem, Ham, and Japheth,

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:45.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
[and notice] and his wife
and the three wives of his sons.”

00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:46.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they went in the ark.

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:48.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had all worked around it and everything.

00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:52.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we find in chapter 8,

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:56.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 16 and 17,

00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:59.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the Flood:

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:01.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go out of the ark,

00:10:01.717 --> 00:10:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
you, your wife,
your sons and your sons’ wives.”

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:09.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here we go.

00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:12.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know
that’s just Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:15.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the scripture said.

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:20.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know the names
of the wife

00:10:21.937 --> 00:10:24.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the sons’ wives.

00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:26.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can ask God,
but I don’t see anything in here

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:33.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s going to tell me
why he decided not to have it in there.

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:38.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,
it has nothing to do with being worthy.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s all about the lineage it went through.

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:42.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know,

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:45.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all know better
than to argue with God.

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:50.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, God, I really love your word
but, you know, a couple of things here . . .’

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not too bright to have that kind of attitude.

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:59.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these are beautiful, faithful women.

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s the point:

00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:07.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the new world, my,

00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:09.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a family reunion
they’re going to have!

00:11:10.986 --> 00:11:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how thrilled you’re going to be,

00:11:13.022 --> 00:11:16.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m sure you’ve got some questions

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what that was like!

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we don’t have much

00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:23.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
while they were on the ark;
how did things go?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:28.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you know, a lot of the old-timers
here at Bethel and at other Bethels

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:31.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
have so many stories, and they’re a pleasure.

00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:34.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, get ready.

00:11:34.143 --> 00:11:36.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’ll be a whole lot
of sensational stories

00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:41.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
from sensational family reunions
like this one.

00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:44.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a wonderful, wonderful future.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the same Bible book of Genesis,

00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:52.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s go over to chapter 21,

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:55.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice here,

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:59.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a different example of a family

00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:02.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’ll enjoy a sensational reunion
in the new world.

00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:06.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlights the fact
that Sarah became pregnant,

00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:09.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is the love of Abraham’s life,

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as humans go.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they bore a son together, Isaac.

00:12:16.786 --> 00:12:20.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is just incredible!

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:24.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take chapter 22 of Genesis,

00:12:24.693 --> 00:12:27.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah gives this direction.

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:31.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for any of you who are fathers
that are listening

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:36.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and you don’t have to be a father
to be touched by this, obviously,

00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:40.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you love Jehovah
and you love Jesus),

00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:42.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says in verse 2:

00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take, please, your son,
your only son whom you so love.”

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, he knew,

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:54.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Abraham sure loves Isaac.’

00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:58.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is remarkable.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:01.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows he loves him so much.

00:13:01.163 --> 00:13:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does He tell him to do?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sacrifice him.

00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we don’t have all or any record

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:18.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
of any feelings Abraham had during all this.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get some indication
of some things going on here.

00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:24.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those of you

00:13:24.353 --> 00:13:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have ever had a son or sons,

00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:32.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
the impact here is just phenomenal.

00:13:32.828 --> 00:13:37.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did go all the way with the knife,

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:39.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had actually,

00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:43.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
in mind and heart,

00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:47.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
committed the sacrifice.

00:13:47.209 --> 00:13:49.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah,

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:51.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, after he reached out with the knife

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everything’s in motion,

00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:55.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had the angel call out

00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:59.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abraham, Abraham!” just in time.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
That stopped the whole thing.

00:14:03.392 --> 00:14:05.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Abraham said: “Here I am!”

00:14:05.528 --> 00:14:09.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he told him in verse 12:
“Do not harm the boy.”

00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:13.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he feel?

00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about a relief.

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:17.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all this time before,
Isaac is wondering:

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, we got this all set up.

00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:21.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the sheep?’

00:14:23.546 --> 00:14:24.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
They must’ve had
some interesting conversations

00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:28.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
after these events.

00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:32.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, do you think
that they’re not going to enjoy

00:14:32.388 --> 00:14:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sensational family reunion?

00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:36.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

00:14:36.692 --> 00:14:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when they find out

00:14:38.494 --> 00:14:41.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
(because they didn’t know,
they heard certain things)

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah,
he went all the way

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:48.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed the sacrifice with his Son.

00:14:48.203 --> 00:14:50.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:14:50.205 --> 00:14:54.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
See that pain
—a lot of pain—

00:14:54.376 --> 00:14:57.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
so a sensational family reunion

00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:59.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Abraham, Isaac, Sarah,

00:14:59.682 --> 00:15:02.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other family members.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now another one in the scriptures
—let’s find Job,

00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:09.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how well we know

00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:13.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate Job so much!

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:20.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we go right there,
the first chapter,

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:27.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
it just helps us to appreciate

00:15:27.743 --> 00:15:29.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the first chapter here;

00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 1 talks
about this “upright man of integrity.”

00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 2 reveals

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “seven sons
and three daughters were born to him.”

00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:43.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then all the livestock is mentioned.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:48.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is quite interesting,
in verse 4 of chapter 1:

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Each of his sons
would hold a banquet at his house

00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:54.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his own set day.”

00:15:54.803 --> 00:15:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s that all about?

00:15:56.905 --> 00:15:59.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have the gift of the <i>Insight</i>  book,

00:15:59.942 --> 00:16:02.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as so many other references.

00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:05.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this has always been a blessed gift.

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:08.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Insight</i>  stated:

00:16:08.183 --> 00:16:13.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It would seem that Job’s seven sons
held a family gathering

00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(possibly a spring or harvest festival)

00:16:17.092 --> 00:16:21.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and as the feasting
made the week-long circuit,

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
each son hosted the banquet
in his own house.”

00:16:26.602 --> 00:16:29.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a close family.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:34.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were all just such a close family

00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:36.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
that loved each other,

00:16:36.178 --> 00:16:38.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
just loved each other.

00:16:39.682 --> 00:16:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
we know in the following verses,

00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:45.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
the challenge of Satan in heaven

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:49.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that’s recorded for us here.

00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:53.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it starts in verse 13.

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:55.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sons and daughters [are] eating” there.

00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:58.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the message comes to Job

00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:02.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the cattle and the Sabeans attacking.

00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:05.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, you see, the wicked one

00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:08.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we never said he wasn’t smart,

00:17:08.177 --> 00:17:11.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
because see verse 16, “fire from God.”

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you know,
now they’re going to blame God for this.

00:17:16.518 --> 00:17:20.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan says, ‘Yeah, they are all going
to think it was God that did this,’

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though he’s behind it

00:17:22.558 --> 00:17:25.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it falls from there and kills the sheep.

00:17:25.327 --> 00:17:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then verses 18 and 19:

00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:30.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“While he was still speaking, . . .

00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:34.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Your sons and your daughters
were eating and drinking wine

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in their oldest brother’s house.

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:39.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly a great wind came.’”

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, apparently,
Jehovah allowed that kind of power.

00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:44.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that case, it killed them all

00:17:47.382 --> 00:17:51.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
—dead, killed them—

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:56.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
seven sons and three daughters.

00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s history.

00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:00.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Job 42

00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Job chapter 42

00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:09.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and,

00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
see, he’s been through the test,

00:18:11.874 --> 00:18:15.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we find here

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:18.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it mentions,

00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:20.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know,
after the things have passed here

00:18:20.983 --> 00:18:25.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah doubled everything
and he’s rich again.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:28.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 13
—Job 42:13:

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He also came to have seven more sons

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and three more daughters.”

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that—?
I mean—

00:18:37.466 --> 00:18:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is just so wonderful.

00:18:40.102 --> 00:18:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, see, Jehovah is not finished with him

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:47.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in the new world

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and likely he’ll work out the timing)

00:18:49.812 --> 00:18:52.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll have all 20 children

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:57.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Job, and his wife—

00:18:57.019 --> 00:19:02.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sensational family reunion!

00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:06.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now more to our day,
I just want to touch on—

00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:10.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just saw on the website

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:12.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
on September 26th, I think,

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:14.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful, beautiful story here,

00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:17.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it had been touched on
with an <i>Awake!</i>  before,

00:19:17.172 --> 00:19:20.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there’s David Maza’s life story,

00:19:20.442 --> 00:19:24.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A Happy Family, Shattered and Rebuilt.”

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:28.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they talk about Davey, David,
or they call him Davey.

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:33.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
I kept thinking,
‘Boy, what a sensational family reunion

00:19:33.522 --> 00:19:37.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re going to have during the new world!’

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:40.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we know you precious brothers,

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:43.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of you, are numb of heart,

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
losing loved ones during these last days.

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:50.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
But please don’t lose heart.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve got your anchor.
See?

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:58.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the sister wraps it up for us here,
a dear friend of mine.

00:19:58.247 --> 00:20:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My mother and father had 17 children.”

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just recently she wrote this:

00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:07.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Recently I lost the last remaining sibling,

00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:11.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“leaving me with no siblings at all.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Strangely, I remember where I was
and what I was doing

00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:18.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I lost each of them.

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:20.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What a blessing it will be

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:24.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when these dreaded memories
will be gone and replaced

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I see my resurrected mom and dad

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:29.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and welcome back each child

00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:31.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s stored in Jehovah’s memory!”

00:20:32.948 --> 00:20:36.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
She writes:
“What a grand reunion that will be

00:20:36.952 --> 00:20:39.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as we gradually grow to perfection

00:20:39.187 --> 00:20:42.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the prospect of living forever!”

00:20:42.591 --> 00:20:46.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a touching expression
from our precious sister!

00:20:46.395 --> 00:20:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the reunion with your loved ones
is a certainty.

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be enjoying

00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:56.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
your family reunions soon.

00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:01.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your anchor in good shape

00:21:01.276 --> 00:21:03.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the sea of wicked mankind is no more.

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:05.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we entreat you;

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:11.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on the coming
sensational family reunions.
