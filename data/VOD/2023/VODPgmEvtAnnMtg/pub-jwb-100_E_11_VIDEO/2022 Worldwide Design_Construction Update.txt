00:00:01 At Isaiah 40:4, 5,
00:00:05 Jehovah says he would remove
00:00:06 seemingly insurmountable obstacles
00:00:09 so the Jews could return to Jerusalem.
00:00:12 The account says:
00:00:14 “Let every valley be raised up,
00:00:17 “and every mountain and hill be made low.
00:00:20 “The rough ground must become level,
00:00:22 “and the rugged ground a valley plain.
00:00:25 “The glory of Jehovah will be revealed,
00:00:28 “and all flesh will see it together,
00:00:30 for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.”
00:00:33 This inspiring prophecy
00:00:35 was initially fulfilled in 537 B.C.E.
00:00:40 There is nothing that can stand in the way
00:00:43 of what Jehovah wants accomplished.
00:00:46 In this report, we will see clear evidence
00:00:49 of Jehovah’s support on theocratic projects today
00:00:53 despite a pandemic, supply chain shortages,
00:00:57 and other challenges.
00:00:59 For example,
00:01:00 the February 2020 announcement
00:01:03 featured in the JW Newsroom
00:01:05 informed us that the Cameroon branch relocation project
00:01:09 finished shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19.
00:01:14 Just in time, the Bethel family had a home
00:01:16 where they could safely shelter in place during the pandemic and still care
00:01:21 for the Kingdom work and more than 48,000 publishers
00:01:25 in that branch territory.
00:01:26 The Argentina Bethel family
00:01:29 also moved into their new branch facility
00:01:31 in Buenos Aires shortly thereafter.
00:01:34 The move, which was organized in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols,
00:01:39 began in July 2021.
00:01:42 The Bethel family saw numerous examples
00:01:45 of Jehovah leveling out overwhelming challenges
00:01:48 during the pandemic.
00:01:50 The successful completion of the new branch facilities
00:01:54 in the midst of that turmoil
00:01:56 has already given a great witness to the community.
00:02:00 It has allowed the Bethel family to focus
00:02:03 on caring for close to 170,000 publishers
00:02:07 in that branch territory.
00:02:09 What a blessing to have these new facilities
00:02:13 to support the Kingdom preaching work!
00:02:16 What about projects happening right now?
00:02:20 Listen closely as we hear updates from brothers in Italy,
00:02:25 Congo, and Angola.
00:02:29 The Italy branch is relocating its facilities
00:02:32 to the city of Bologna in northern Italy,
00:02:35 which is located about 370 kilometers,
00:02:38 or 230 miles, from Rome.
00:02:42 Initially, the Construction Project Committee
00:02:45 wanted to use our brothers and sisters
00:02:47 as volunteers.
00:02:48 However, at a certain point, it was decided
00:02:51 to rely on an outside development company,
00:02:54 both for the design and renovation of the office building that was purchased
00:02:59 as well as for the design and construction of the residential buildings.
00:03:06 When this decision was made,
00:03:08 we did not imagine that a few months afterward
00:03:10 we would not be able to use our volunteers
00:03:13 because at the beginning of 2020,
00:03:16 COVID-19 struck northern Italy,
00:03:18 including the city of Bologna.
00:03:21 As a consequence, the government suspended activities, including construction.
00:03:28 After about one month, they lifted the restrictions.
00:03:31 And as a result,
00:03:33 we could get back in touch with the companies and continue the work
00:03:38 while respecting government protocol
00:03:40 and direction from our organization.
00:03:44 Thanks to Jehovah’s direction,
00:03:46 despite the pandemic,
00:03:48 we are happy to see how this project
00:03:50 is moving forward much faster than we expected.
00:03:53 And we look forward to being able
00:03:56 to move into these new buildings
00:03:57 by the end of 2024.
00:04:00 In 2012, we had a little over
00:04:03 168,000 publishers in our branch territory.
00:04:08 By the end of 2021, the total number of publishers grew
00:04:13 to more than 209,000 publishers.
00:04:16 Because it was impractical to expand the branch facility in Kinshasa,
00:04:21 we looked for property that could care for the immediate
00:04:24 and future needs of the branch.
00:04:26 We purchased property
00:04:28 in the country’s second-largest city,
00:04:31 Lubumbashi,
00:04:32 where a developer
00:04:34 was already building housing and office units.
00:04:37 The developer already had the zoning, permits,
00:04:41 and completed design packages.
00:04:43 This saved much time and allowed the project to move ahead
00:04:47 with minimal disruption even during the pandemic,
00:04:51 and we were happy for that.
00:04:53 For the internal work of the new offices,
00:04:56 we needed a contractor
00:04:58 who could design and install to the standards of our organization
00:05:03  and within the project budget.
00:05:05 We knew this would be hard to find in Congo
00:05:08 —and even harder with the limitations of the pandemic.
00:05:13 One of the suppliers that we use
00:05:15 for food and relief supplies in the area
00:05:18 mentioned to us that they have a partner company
00:05:22 who specializes in construction
00:05:24 and is newly active in the country.
00:05:26 We didn’t expect that the answer to this challenge
00:05:29 would come from this unusual direction.
00:05:32 But we were surprised to find that they did in fact qualify
00:05:36 to meet the high standards and expectations of such a branch project.
00:05:41 As the relationship grew, we saw
00:05:44 fine collaboration between our teams,
00:05:46 and they continue to work along with us now as the project expands.
00:05:51 We truly have seen
00:05:53 Jehovah smoothing out the path for this project.
00:05:57 We have already started moving
00:05:59 some Bethelites to this new site
00:06:02 and look forward to the project’s completion
00:06:04 in mid-2024.
00:06:08 In December 2021,
00:06:10 a building was purchased that will provide
00:06:13 additional rooms and offices
00:06:16 for the Bethel family at our branch.
00:06:20 This building is located about a ten-minute walk
00:06:24 from the current Bethel facility.
00:06:26 Because of the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:06:30 the entire process for the acquisition of this building,
00:06:34 even including the verification of the legal aspects,
00:06:38 had to be done by videoconference.
00:06:42 During the last week of the negotiation process
00:06:46 when there were just five days remaining to sign the purchase and sale agreement
00:06:50 and during a stage
00:06:52 in which the negotiation team from the branch and the seller
00:06:55 had already agreed on the purchase and sale price,
00:06:59 we discovered that the structure of the building needed some repairs
00:07:04 and reinforcement in some areas.
00:07:07 How did the team negotiating the purchase handle this obstacle?
00:07:13 The seller was asked to take responsibility for the repairs
00:07:17 and to reinforce the building’s structure,
00:07:21 closely following the engineering details that would be provided by the branch.
00:07:27 After several prayers by the branch’s negotiation team,
00:07:32 the seller accepted the responsibility
00:07:36 and even paid for all the expenses involved in this repair.
00:07:43 The repair was completed.
00:07:45 And shortly after,
00:07:46 the work to completely renovate the building began.
00:07:50 We look forward to seeing
00:07:53 some of the Bethel family
00:07:54 move into this new building in early 2024.
00:08:00 In addition to these new branch facilities,
00:08:03 we also have many other needs to fill.
00:08:06 For example, in order to train brothers and sisters
00:08:10 to carry out the preaching and teaching work,
00:08:13 there continues to be a need for theocratic school facilities.
00:08:18 In Madagascar, the branch hosted classes at Bethel
00:08:22 because they didn’t have any other suitable facilities.
00:08:27 Well, in June 2021, they finished construction
00:08:30 of a new school facility
00:08:32 and will now be able to schedule up to four classes there each year.
00:08:37 Currently,
00:08:38 there are over 40 existing school facilities
00:08:42 and we have around 20
00:08:43 active school facility projects
00:08:45 at various stages of development.
00:08:49 What about facilities to support
00:08:52 the growing media production of the organization?
00:08:54 We’re happy to report that we have finished the studio projects
00:08:58 at the South Africa and Australasia branches.
00:09:02 In Australasia,
00:09:03 that includes the backlot that is used
00:09:06 for The Good News According to Jesus video series.
00:09:10 Soon, if Jehovah wills,
00:09:12 we will begin construction on the new site in Ramapo, New York.
00:09:16 We look forward to seeing how Jehovah
00:09:19 uses this facility
00:09:21 to care for the needs of his people.
00:09:24 It is clear that neither the pandemic
00:09:27 nor ongoing turmoil in this world
00:09:30 has been able to stop theocratic building projects.
00:09:34 And as world conditions continue to deteriorate,
00:09:38 we are confident that the words of Isaiah 40:4, 5
00:09:43 will be true for us.
00:09:45 Yes, Jehovah will help us overcome
00:09:48 any mountainlike obstacles that we face.
00:09:52 We earnestly pray for Jehovah to bless these
00:09:55 and future building projects.
00:09:58 And we thank you dear brothers and sisters
00:10:02 for supporting them by means of your prayers,
00:10:05 skills, time, and resources.
00:10:10 May all praise and glory go to our great God, Jehovah,
00:10:15 who continues to clear the way for us!
