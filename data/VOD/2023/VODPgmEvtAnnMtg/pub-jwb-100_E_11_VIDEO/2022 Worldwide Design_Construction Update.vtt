At Isaiah 40:4, 5,

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:06.694 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says he would remove

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:09.780 line:10% position:50% align:center
seemingly insurmountable obstacles

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the Jews could return to Jerusalem.

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account says:

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let every valley be raised up,

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The rough ground must become level,

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the rugged ground a valley plain.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The glory of Jehovah will be revealed,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all flesh will see it together,

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.”

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
This inspiring prophecy

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
was initially fulfilled in 537 B.C.E.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing that can stand in the way

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what Jehovah wants accomplished.

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this report, we will see clear evidence

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s support
on theocratic projects today

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite a pandemic, supply chain shortages,

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other challenges.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:00.998 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:03.167 line:10% position:50% align:center
the February 2020 announcement

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.836 line:10% position:50% align:center
featured in the JW Newsroom

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
informed us
that the Cameroon branch relocation project

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
finished shortly before the outbreak
of COVID-19.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just in time, the Bethel family had a home

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they could safely shelter in place
during the pandemic and still care

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:25.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Kingdom work
and more than 48,000 publishers

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that branch territory.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.318 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Argentina Bethel family

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:31.612 line:10% position:50% align:center
also moved into their new branch facility

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:34.865 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Buenos Aires shortly thereafter.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
The move, which was organized
in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols,

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
began in July 2021.

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bethel family saw numerous examples

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah leveling out
overwhelming challenges

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the pandemic.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
The successful completion
of the new branch facilities

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of that turmoil

00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
has already given
a great witness to the community.

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has allowed the Bethel family to focus

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
on caring for close to 170,000 publishers

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that branch territory.

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing to have these new facilities

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the Kingdom preaching work!

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about projects happening right now?

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:25.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen closely as we hear updates
from brothers in Italy,

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:27.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Congo, and Angola.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Italy branch is relocating its facilities

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the city of Bologna in northern Italy,

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is located about 370 kilometers,

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 230 miles, from Rome.

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.269 line:10% position:50% align:center
Initially, the Construction Project Committee

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.271 line:10% position:50% align:center
wanted to use our brothers and sisters

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
as volunteers.

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, at a certain point, it was decided

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rely on an outside development company,

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
both for the design and renovation
of the office building that was purchased

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as for the design and construction
of the residential buildings.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
When this decision was made,

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did not imagine
that a few months afterward

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would not be able to use our volunteers

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at the beginning of 2020,

00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19 struck northern Italy,

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the city of Bologna.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a consequence, the government
suspended activities, including construction.

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
After about one month,
they lifted the restrictions.

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result,

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:38.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could get back in touch with the companies
and continue the work

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
while respecting government protocol

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and direction from our organization.

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to Jehovah’s direction,

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the pandemic,

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are happy to see how this project

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
is moving forward
much faster than we expected.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:56.131 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we look forward to being able

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.716 line:10% position:50% align:center
to move into these new buildings

00:03:57.716 --> 00:03:59.760 line:10% position:50% align:center
by the end of 2024.

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:03.639 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 2012, we had a little over

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
168,000 publishers in our branch territory.

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the end of 2021,
the total number of publishers grew

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
to more than 209,000 publishers.

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because it was impractical
to expand the branch facility in Kinshasa,

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
we looked for property
that could care for the immediate

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future needs of the branch.

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:28.997 line:10% position:50% align:center
We purchased property

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the country’s second-largest city,

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:32.918 line:10% position:50% align:center
Lubumbashi,

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:34.128 line:10% position:50% align:center
where a developer

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:37.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
was already building housing
and office units.

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:41.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
The developer already had
the zoning, permits,

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:43.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and completed design packages.

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
This saved much time
and allowed the project to move ahead

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
with minimal disruption
even during the pandemic,

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:53.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were happy for that.

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:56.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the internal work of the new offices,

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed a contractor

00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could design and install
to the standards of our organization

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
 and within the project budget.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew this would be hard to find in Congo

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:13.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and even harder
with the limitations of the pandemic.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:15.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the suppliers that we use

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
for food and relief supplies in the area

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:22.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned to us
that they have a partner company

00:05:22.134 --> 00:05:24.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
who specializes in construction

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:26.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is newly active in the country.

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:29.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t expect
that the answer to this challenge

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
would come from this unusual direction.

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:36.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we were surprised to find
that they did in fact qualify

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:41.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the high standards and expectations
of such a branch project.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the relationship grew, we saw

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
fine collaboration between our teams,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they continue to work along with us
now as the project expands.

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:53.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly have seen

00:05:53.832 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah smoothing out the path
for this project.

00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:59.671 line:10% position:50% align:center
We have already started moving

00:05:59.671 --> 00:06:02.049 line:10% position:50% align:center
some Bethelites to this new site

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:04.718 line:10% position:50% align:center
and look forward to the project’s completion

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:06.678 line:10% position:50% align:center
in mid-2024.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:10.891 line:10% position:50% align:center
In December 2021,

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:13.852 line:10% position:50% align:center
a building was purchased that will provide

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:16.021 line:10% position:50% align:center
additional rooms and offices

00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:18.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Bethel family at our branch.

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:24.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
This building is located
about a ten-minute walk

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:26.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the current Bethel facility.

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:30.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the restrictions
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:34.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire process
for the acquisition of this building,

00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:38.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
even including the verification
of the legal aspects,

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:40.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to be done by videoconference.

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:46.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the last week
of the negotiation process

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there were just five days remaining
to sign the purchase and sale agreement

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and during a stage

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:55.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which the negotiation team
from the branch and the seller

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:59.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
had already agreed
on the purchase and sale price,

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:04.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discovered that the structure
of the building needed some repairs

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:07.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reinforcement in some areas.

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:10.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the team negotiating the purchase
handle this obstacle?

00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:17.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
The seller was asked
to take responsibility for the repairs

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:21.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to reinforce the building’s structure,

00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:26.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
closely following the engineering details
that would be provided by the branch.

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:30.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
After several prayers
by the branch’s negotiation team,

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:35.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
the seller accepted the responsibility

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even paid for all the expenses
involved in this repair.

00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
The repair was completed.

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:46.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And shortly after,

00:07:46.695 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work to completely renovate the building
began.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
We look forward to seeing

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
some of the Bethel family

00:07:54.953 --> 00:07:59.207 line:10% position:50% align:center
move into this new building in early 2024.

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:03.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to these new branch facilities,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also have many other needs to fill.

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:10.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in order to train
brothers and sisters

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:13.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out the preaching and teaching work,

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:17.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
there continues to be a need
for theocratic school facilities.

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:22.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Madagascar,
the branch hosted classes at Bethel

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:25.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they didn’t have
any other suitable facilities.

00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:30.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in June 2021,
they finished construction

00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:32.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a new school facility

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:36.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will now be able to schedule
up to four classes there each year.

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:38.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently,

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are over 40 existing school facilities

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:43.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have around 20

00:08:43.335 --> 00:08:45.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
active school facility projects

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:47.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
at various stages of development.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about facilities to support

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
the growing media production
of the organization?

00:08:54.763 --> 00:08:58.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to report
that we have finished the studio projects

00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:02.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the South Africa and Australasia branches.

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:03.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Australasia,

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:06.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
that includes the backlot that is used

00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:10.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
for <i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>
video series.

00:09:10.362 --> 00:09:12.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, if Jehovah wills,

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:16.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will begin construction
on the new site in Ramapo, New York.

00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:19.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to seeing how Jehovah

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:21.164 line:10% position:50% align:center
uses this facility

00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:23.417 line:10% position:50% align:center
to care for the needs of his people.

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is clear that neither the pandemic

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:30.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor ongoing turmoil in this world

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:34.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been able to stop
theocratic building projects.

00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:38.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as world conditions
continue to deteriorate,

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:43.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are confident
that the words of Isaiah 40:4, 5

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be true for us.

00:09:45.647 --> 00:09:48.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah will help us overcome

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:52.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
any mountainlike obstacles that we face.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
We earnestly pray for Jehovah to bless these

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:58.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future building projects.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank you dear brothers and sisters

00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:05.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
for supporting them by means of your prayers,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
skills, time, and resources.

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all praise and glory
go to our great God, Jehovah,

00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:18.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
who continues to clear the way for us!
