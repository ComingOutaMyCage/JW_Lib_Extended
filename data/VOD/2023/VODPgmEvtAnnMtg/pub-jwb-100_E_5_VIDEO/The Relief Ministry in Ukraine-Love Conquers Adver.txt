00:00:02 We thought that this might be
00:00:05 some kind of pushing between the empires,
00:00:09 but something else happened —the worst-case scenario.
00:00:14 We were aware of the fact that we had to prepare
00:00:15 for some serious changes.
00:00:19 There were thousands of people at the border.
00:00:22 People had to wait in long queues several kilometers long.
00:00:27 Almost every day,
00:00:29 we received 200 or more refugees
00:00:32 —our brothers and sisters who were seeking refuge in Poland.
00:00:38 It was really touching, since most of them had only one bag.
00:00:42 It was not possible to take more.
00:00:47 The brothers of the Coordinators’ Committee
00:00:49 of the Governing Body
00:00:50 were analyzing with us
00:00:52 about how to help and what we could do.
00:00:57 Immediately
00:00:58 the first Disaster Relief Committee
00:01:00 was set up,
00:01:02 and when we realized that there was
00:01:04 already a need in the whole of Poland,
00:01:07 16 committees started their work.
00:01:11 The number of DC-50 applications,
00:01:15 of those who wanted to volunteer,
00:01:17 increased every week by thousands,
00:01:20 indicating that the willingness and readiness to help was huge.
00:01:26 We prepared everything in order to be able
00:01:29 to welcome the refugees at the border crossings,
00:01:31 at the reception points set up by the authorities on the Ukrainian border,
00:01:35 and at other locations
00:01:37 where the trains from Ukraine were arriving.
00:01:40 We knew we would have to ask the congregations for accommodations.
00:01:46 At the beginning,
00:01:47 we prepared a survey that helped us to organize everything.
00:01:52 We know that it’s thanks to Jehovah’s backing
00:01:56 because in just a few days,
00:01:58 we received more than 7,500 replies.
00:02:04 Four Assembly Halls and 22 Kingdom Halls
00:02:07 were temporarily converted to refugee relief centers.
00:02:14 The brothers were traveling for days and needed some basic things
00:02:18 —hygienic products, diapers for children, and many other things—
00:02:24 not only clothes but many basic necessities.
00:02:27 They received food; they could warm up,
00:02:30 take a shower, and get some rest.
00:02:34 In addition to this, in many places,
00:02:37 volunteers prepared rooms for donated garments
00:02:40 where brothers and sisters could choose clothing.
00:02:44 In some places, brothers prepared
00:02:47 special areas for children
00:02:50 where there were toys, crayons,
00:02:53 something to draw on, something to play with
00:02:56 so that the children could feel busy there.
00:02:59 Doing something helped them
00:03:02 to get their minds off what they saw when they were fleeing.
00:03:07 The children expressed their gratitude in their pictures.
00:03:11 Almost everywhere they wrote: “Dziękuję.”
00:03:15 “Spasiba.”  (Thank you.)
00:03:18 They drew pictures of Paradise,
00:03:20 expressions of their hope.
00:03:23 It was so touching.
00:03:26 The circuit overseers
00:03:28 together with the elders
00:03:29 did something absolutely spectacular.
00:03:32 In the beginning, some of these brothers
00:03:35 made hundreds of shepherding calls in two or three weeks.
00:03:44 The goal was to deliver
00:03:46 40,000 humanitarian aid boxes.
00:03:49 We were responsible for purchasing food,
00:03:52 hygiene products, first-aid items,
00:03:54 medical supplies.
00:03:57 We had to find a logistical location where we could store all of this.
00:04:01 Afterward, we had to think about how to pack it,
00:04:05 how to deliver it to the border,
00:04:07 and then how to transport it to Ukraine,
00:04:10 where at this very moment the war continued.
00:04:13 It was very nice to observe the volunteers
00:04:16 who came to help us pack up the supplies.
00:04:19 When the brothers from all over the country got to know about the need,
00:04:22 they were ready to drive
00:04:24 300 or more kilometers (185 miles) for many hours
00:04:27 to devote a couple of hours to packing boxes.
00:04:31 As it turned out later on,
00:04:33 it was more or less 190 tons of supplies.
00:04:38 In each package,
00:04:39 we also put some drawings made by children.
00:04:42 There was an expression of love in those humanitarian aid boxes.
00:04:49 Having this opportunity to help the brothers,
00:04:52 we saw an expression of Jehovah’s love
00:04:56 and might in all these efforts.
00:04:59 Only Jehovah could prepare his people
00:05:02 for such a well-organized and effective activity.
00:05:07 Many of the brothers have commented
00:05:09 that the fact that they see
00:05:11 so much being done to help the brothers
00:05:13 in Ukraine right now
00:05:15 convinces them that if they are in that situation in the future,
00:05:18 if there is some time when they need that love or they need the help,
00:05:22 well, Jehovah’s organization is going to be there to help them as well.
00:05:26 Belonging to Jehovah’s household
00:05:30 and being part of a worldwide family
00:05:32 is priceless.
00:05:34 The hatred in the world continues to grow constantly,
00:05:39 and there’s just more conflict and disunity.
00:05:43 At the same time,
00:05:45 the unity and the love of Jehovah’s people
00:05:49 just keeps on increasing,
00:05:51 and it just becomes more and more powerful.
