00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:05.359 line:10% position:50% align:center
We thought that this might be

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.655 line:10% position:50% align:center
some kind of pushing between the empires,

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
but something else happened
—the worst-case scenario.

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were aware of the fact
that we had to prepare

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some serious changes.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were thousands of people
at the border.

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
People had to wait in long queues
several kilometers long.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost every day,

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received 200 or more refugees

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our brothers and sisters
who were seeking refuge in Poland.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was really touching,
since most of them had only one bag.

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not possible to take more.

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers of the Coordinators’ Committee

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
were analyzing with us

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to help and what we could do.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.537 line:10% position:50% align:center
Immediately

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
the first Disaster Relief Committee

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.665 line:10% position:50% align:center
was set up,

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we realized that there was

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
already a need in the whole of Poland,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
16 committees started their work.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of DC-50 applications,

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who wanted to volunteer,

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
increased every week by thousands,

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:25.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating that the willingness
and readiness to help was huge.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:29.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prepared everything in order to be able

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
to welcome the refugees
at the border crossings,

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the reception points set up
by the authorities on the Ukrainian border,

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at other locations

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the trains from Ukraine were arriving.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew we would have to ask
the congregations for accommodations.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the beginning,

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
we prepared a survey
that helped us to organize everything.

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that it’s thanks to Jehovah’s backing

00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:58.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in just a few days,

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received more than 7,500 replies.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four Assembly Halls and 22 Kingdom Halls

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
were temporarily converted
to refugee relief centers.

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers were traveling for days
and needed some basic things

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hygienic products, diapers for children,
and many other things—

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only clothes but many basic necessities.

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
They received food;
they could warm up,

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
take a shower,
and get some rest.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to this, in many places,

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
volunteers prepared rooms
for donated garments

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
where brothers and sisters
could choose clothing.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:47.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some places, brothers prepared

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:49.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
special areas for children

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there were toys, crayons,

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
something to draw on, something to play with

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the children could feel busy there.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing something helped them

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get their minds off what they saw
when they were fleeing.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
The children expressed their gratitude
in their pictures.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:15.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost everywhere they wrote: <i>“Dzi</i><i>ękuję.”</i>

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Spasiba.”</i>  (Thank you.)

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
They drew pictures of Paradise,

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressions of their hope.

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:25.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so touching.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:28.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
The circuit overseers

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
together with the elders

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
did something absolutely spectacular.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the beginning,
some of these brothers

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
made hundreds of shepherding calls
in two or three weeks.

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:46.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal was to deliver

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:49.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
40,000 humanitarian aid boxes.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:52.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were responsible for purchasing food,

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.880 line:10% position:50% align:center
hygiene products, first-aid items,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
medical supplies.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:00.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to find a logistical location
where we could store all of this.

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Afterward,
we had to think about how to pack it,

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to deliver it to the border,

00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then how to transport it to Ukraine,

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
where at this very moment the war continued.

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very nice to observe the volunteers

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:18.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
who came to help us pack up the supplies.

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:22.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the brothers from all over the country
got to know about the need,

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were ready to drive

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
300 or more kilometers (185 miles)
for many hours

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
to devote a couple of hours to packing boxes.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turned out later on,

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:38.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was more or less 190 tons of supplies.

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:39.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each package,

00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also put some drawings made by children.

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:46.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was an expression of love
in those humanitarian aid boxes.

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:52.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having this opportunity to help the brothers,

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:56.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw an expression of Jehovah’s love

00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:58.277 line:10% position:50% align:center
and might in all these efforts.

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:02.948 line:10% position:50% align:center
Only Jehovah could prepare his people

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
for such a well-organized
and effective activity.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.580 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many of the brothers have commented

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.415 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the fact that they see

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:13.458 line:10% position:50% align:center
so much being done to help the brothers

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Ukraine right now

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
convinces them that if they are
in that situation in the future,

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
if there is some time when they need
that love or they need the help,

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, Jehovah’s organization
is going to be there to help them as well.

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:30.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Belonging to Jehovah’s household

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:32.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being part of a worldwide family

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:34.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
is priceless.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hatred in the world
continues to grow constantly,

00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:43.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s just more conflict and disunity.

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:45.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:49.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unity and the love of Jehovah’s people

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
just keeps on increasing,

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it just becomes more and more powerful.
