00:00:01 We are living in the last of the last days.
00:00:06 That means soon we are going to face events
00:00:11 that will test our integrity as never before.
00:00:16 Yes, now is the time
00:00:18 that we need to be alert and decisive.
00:00:24 Now, that’s a similar situation to what our brothers
00:00:27 found themselves in in the first century.
00:00:31 Yes, they had some dramatic events that faced them.
00:00:37 What were some of the events
00:00:39 that early Christians had to deal with,
00:00:42 and how did Jesus prepare them to face those events?
00:00:47 And what does it mean for us today?
00:00:51 Well, first of all, I’d like you to imagine this scene.
00:00:55 We’ll go back in time to Nisan 9, 33 C.E.
00:01:00 Do you remember what happened on that day?
00:01:02 Jesus was mounted on a donkey.
00:01:06 And in your mind, can you visualize it?
00:01:08 You’re with Jesus as he starts to go down the area
00:01:12 on the Mount of Olives in the Kidron Valley,
00:01:14 and looking up toward the city of Jerusalem, what happens?
00:01:18 The crowds start to gather —more and more people.
00:01:22 People start throwing their garments on the road;
00:01:24 others cut down branches and wave them around.
00:01:27 They call out: “Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s name!”
00:01:31 The whole city is in an uproar!
00:01:34 How exciting that would have been!
00:01:37 And yet, at that exciting moment in his life,
00:01:43 Jesus started sobbing and crying.
00:01:48 Why?
00:01:49 Let’s turn to the record in Luke chapter 19
00:01:54 —Luke chapter 19
00:01:56 and verses 41 through 44.
00:02:01 And here the inspired account tells us
00:02:03 that “when [Jesus] got nearby,
00:02:06 “he viewed the city
00:02:08 “and wept over it,
00:02:11 “saying: ‘If you, even you, had discerned on this day
00:02:16 “‘the things having to do with peace
00:02:20 “‘—but now they have been hidden from your eyes.
00:02:23 “‘Because the days will come upon you
00:02:26 “‘when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes
00:02:30 “‘and will encircle you and besiege you from every side.
00:02:36 “‘They will dash you and your children within you to the ground,
00:02:41 “‘and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you,
00:02:45 because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.’”
00:02:51 What do we see from these verses?
00:02:55 Do we see the compassion Jesus had for those who would be killed
00:03:00 when Jerusalem was to be destroyed?
00:03:02 Yes, he was envisioning the destruction
00:03:06 that would occur in the year 70 C.E.
00:03:09 He was moved by the emotions of that
00:03:13 —so much so that he cried loudly,
00:03:17 not silently
00:03:19 (like he did when he was about to resurrect Lazarus)
00:03:22 but audibly and loudly.
00:03:24 Now, what do we learn from this?
00:03:27 Well, for a start, we can see Jehovah’s love
00:03:30 for people as reflected in Jesus.
00:03:34 Jesus was very distraught thinking about what would happen
00:03:38 to that city and its inhabitants.
00:03:41 And then in verse 44,
00:03:43 what was the other thing that Jesus was distressed about?
00:03:47 That that was a time
00:03:50 of judgment, we might say, or inspection.
00:03:54 Yes, even though Jesus was thinking ahead to future events,
00:03:59 he realized that they were missing the opportunity at that time
00:04:04 to do something
00:04:06 —things that they needed to do to prepare for the future.
00:04:11 There’s something else that we learn too.
00:04:14 Not only do we learn from the compassion that Jesus displayed
00:04:18 (which we should likewise display
00:04:20 when we think about what’s going to happen to this wicked world)
00:04:24 but also if Jesus had so much emotion and feeling
00:04:29 about wicked people who were about to be destroyed,
00:04:32 how do you think he felt about his followers?
00:04:35 Do you think he wanted to prepare them?
00:04:38 Of course.
00:04:39 And that’s why we’re not surprised that two days later
00:04:42 he took aside his apostles and gave them some instructions.
00:04:47 Let’s turn there to the record
00:04:49 in Luke 21:20-22.
00:04:55 Jesus is recorded as saying:
00:04:58 “However, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies
00:05:02 “[now in this case, he’s referring to 66 C.E.],
00:05:06 “then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.
00:05:11 “Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains,
00:05:16 “let those in the midst of her
00:05:18 “[that is, in the midst of Jerusalem] leave,
00:05:21 “and let those in the countryside
00:05:24 “not enter into her [or, enter into Jerusalem],
00:05:28 “because these are days for meting out justice
00:05:32 in order that all the things written may be fulfilled.”
00:05:38 Did you notice that there were three groups of his followers that he was referring to?
00:05:43 He spoke about those who lived “in Judea,”
00:05:46 so that wasn’t just Jerusalem; that was the surrounding area.
00:05:49 So they were told: ‘Get out of there.
00:05:52 Flee; go to the mountains.’
00:05:54 Then he spoke to those who would be living in Jerusalem.
00:05:58 And what did he say?
00:05:59 ‘Leave the city.’
00:06:02 And then the third group, those who would live “in the countryside”
00:06:05 —we know many people were farmers,
00:06:07 and they lived in open areas, doing agriculture.
00:06:12 Normally, what would be expected
00:06:14 is that if armies were to come to a certain area,
00:06:18 these people would flee into the fortified city.
00:06:21 So, what Jesus told them to do was the opposite.
00:06:27 So no matter where his followers would be,
00:06:30 whether in the countryside, in the city, or in the general area,
00:06:34 what was the common denominator?
00:06:38 Don’t flee to the city.
00:06:42 Don’t put your trust in Jerusalem.
00:06:46 Yes, Jesus was telling them what they needed to know
00:06:51 before the events would occur.
00:06:54 Now, what really was the lesson
00:06:58 that Jesus was impressing on these ones?
00:07:02 Well, although those he was speaking to at that time were Jewish,
00:07:07 they had to realize that Jerusalem
00:07:10 was no longer the earthly seat of Jehovah’s Kingdom.
00:07:14 They had to also realize that the temple
00:07:17 was no longer the center of Jehovah’s worship.
00:07:22 So Christians had to get those facts clearly in mind
00:07:27 and make their decisions at that time,
00:07:30 prior to the events that would come later.
00:07:34 Now, maybe we could illustrate in the modern sense.
00:07:38 Many of us have had to face the issue with regard to blood transfusions.
00:07:44 When do you need to make your decision with regard to that?
00:07:48 Is it when you’re in the ambulance, semiconscious, in pain?
00:07:53 Is it, “Oh, give me the DPA;
00:07:58 can you read the fine print”?
00:08:01 Or is it when you get into the emergency operating room
00:08:05 and you start arguing with people and asking questions?
00:08:08 No.
00:08:10 We realize that now is the time
00:08:13 that we need to make our decisions.
00:08:17 Then we need to live by those decisions.
00:08:20 And then if an emergency should occur,
00:08:24 we’ll be ready for that situation.
00:08:27 That was the lesson Jesus was teaching them.
00:08:31 Yes, the Christians back in the first century
00:08:34 had to rid themselves of any feelings of nationalistic pride,
00:08:39 any feelings that Jerusalem was the city.
00:08:42 Otherwise, they would make the wrong decision.
00:08:46 This was especially true
00:08:49 in the year 66 C.E.
00:08:53 What happened in that year?
00:08:55 Well, let’s consider a brief overview.
00:09:00 Most of us are familiar with what happened
00:09:02 toward the end of 66 C.E.
00:09:05 At that time, the Roman army,
00:09:07 under the leadership of Cestius Gallus,
00:09:10 attacked Jerusalem.
00:09:13 But unexpectedly, they retreated,
00:09:18 allowing time for Christians in the city
00:09:20 to flee Jerusalem.
00:09:23 Was that the only thing that happened
00:09:25 in the year 66 C.E.?
00:09:29 No.
00:09:30 Let’s look back in time
00:09:32 to see what other events took place.
00:09:35 This will help us understand why Christians
00:09:38 needed to be alert and decisive beforehand.
00:09:43 First, let’s think about the background.
00:09:47 The Jewish nation was fed up
00:09:49 with Roman taxation and corruption
00:09:51 way back in Jesus’ day.
00:09:53 But by the beginning of 66 C.E.,
00:09:56 the situation was even worse.
00:10:00 The Roman governor of Judea, Gessius Florus,
00:10:03 was totally corrupt
00:10:05 and was notorious for his cruelty.
00:10:09 The spirit of rebellion was everywhere.
00:10:12 Judea was a powder keg ready to explode.
00:10:18 Around the spring of 66 C.E.,
00:10:21 Florus plundered the temple treasury in Jerusalem,
00:10:24 stealing some 17 talents.
00:10:27 This caused a revolt among the Jews.
00:10:30 In retaliation, Florus ordered his soldiers
00:10:34 to attack the rebels and allowed his soldiers
00:10:36 to plunder hundreds of homes
00:10:38 and to kill some 3,600 Jews.
00:10:44 However, the Roman assault was repelled,
00:10:47 and Florus and his men retreated from the city.
00:10:54 If you were there at that time,
00:10:56 how would you have reacted?
00:11:00 Would you have been outraged by Florus’ action?
00:11:06 If you lived in the countryside,
00:11:08 would you think the Romans may return
00:11:11 and now was the time to flee to Jerusalem?
00:11:15 Christians needed to be alert and decisive.
00:11:18 Remember,
00:11:20 Jerusalem was not important to Christians.
00:11:23 It was not the place of safety.
00:11:27 What happened next?
00:11:29 Eleazar, the son of High Priest Ananias,
00:11:32 gained control of the temple area.
00:11:35 He suspended the sacrifices offered to the emperor
00:11:40 and then drove the remaining Romans
00:11:42 out of the upper part of the city.
00:11:46 If you were there,
00:11:48 would you have been proud,
00:11:50 happy that the corrupt Romans
00:11:52 were forced to leave?
00:11:55 Remember, though,
00:11:56 Jerusalem was not important to Christians.
00:11:59 It was not the place of safety.
00:12:03 Christians needed to be alert
00:12:05 and decisive and not distracted.
00:12:09 Then around July/August,
00:12:12 Menahem, the leader of another Jewish faction,
00:12:15 overran the Roman fortress of Masada
00:12:18 and seized Roman weapons from there.
00:12:23 He then returned to Jerusalem
00:12:26 and captured the Tower, or Fortress, of Antonia.
00:12:31 They set fire to Herod’s palace,
00:12:33 the palaces of Agrippa and Bernice,
00:12:36 as well as High Priest Ananias’ home.
00:12:40 Then they ordered the murder
00:12:42 of High Priest Ananias and his brother Hezekiah.
00:12:46 Following that,
00:12:47 they returned to the Fortress of Antonia
00:12:50 and massacred the garrison
00:12:52 of Roman soldiers still there.
00:12:55 The city was divided and in an uproar,
00:12:58 so Menahem and his men
00:13:00 escaped back to Masada.
00:13:03 Do you see how easy it would have been
00:13:06 to join sides with one of the factions?
00:13:10 Remember, though, these events
00:13:12 were not important to Christians.
00:13:15 They needed to be alert and decisive
00:13:18 and not distracted.
00:13:21 Finally, around November,
00:13:23 Cestius Gallus, the governor of Syria,
00:13:25 marched with his troops
00:13:27 encamped about six miles from Jerusalem.
00:13:31 Even though it was a Sabbath day,
00:13:34 the Jewish rebels streamed out of the city
00:13:37 and made a hasty assault on the Romans.
00:13:40 The Romans retreated to Beth-horon,
00:13:42 and the Jews captured
00:13:44 Roman supplies and weapons.
00:13:47 Agrippa sent two representatives,
00:13:49 his personal friends,
00:13:51 to the Jewish rebels
00:13:53 to persuade them to lay down their weapons
00:13:55 and to promise them clemency.
00:13:58 But the rebels killed one of the men
00:14:00 and wounded the other.
00:14:04 Cestius pursued the rebels to Jerusalem,
00:14:09 camped at Mount Scopus for three days,
00:14:12 and then started to undermine the city wall
00:14:15 and tried to set fire to the gate of the temple.
00:14:19 But then, for some unexpected reason,
00:14:23 Gallus and his army retreated.
00:14:27 Alert Christians in Jerusalem and Judea
00:14:29 immediately acted decisively and fled.
00:14:34 The rebels chased the Roman army,
00:14:36 inflicting considerable losses
00:14:38 in both men and supplies,
00:14:40 and Gallus ordered his soldiers to retreat.
00:14:44 After seven days,
00:14:46 the Jewish rebels gave up chasing the Romans
00:14:49 and pillaged the supplies left behind.
00:14:52 They returned to Jerusalem after eight days.
00:14:58 What was the situation in Jerusalem at that time?
00:15:02 Josephus says:
00:15:04 “In [the] face of the exhilaration
00:15:06 “which now seized Jerusalem
00:15:08 “the spokesmen for peace [with Rome]
00:15:11 “were obliged to remain silent. . . .
00:15:14 “Even those opposed to the war
00:15:16 “were swept along by the force
00:15:18 of the circumstances.”
00:15:21 Those who supported Rome left.
00:15:24 “All the rest
00:15:25 “were won over to the side of the rebels,
00:15:28 partly by force, partly by persuasion.”
00:15:33 If you were there,
00:15:35 what would you have done?
00:15:38 Many Jews started to flee to Jerusalem,
00:15:41 seeking refuge there.
00:15:44 But was it a safe refuge?
00:15:46 No.
00:15:48 There was anarchy in the city.
00:15:50 Several Jewish political factions fought each other.
00:15:54 Eventually, in 70 C.E.,
00:15:56 Jerusalem was destroyed along with its temple.
00:16:00 But the Christians who were alert
00:16:02 and decisive were safe,
00:16:04 far away in Pella,
00:16:06 on the other side of the Jordan River.
00:16:10 What do we learn from this brief review
00:16:12 of the events of 66 C.E.?
00:16:17 It wasn’t just one event —was it?—
00:16:20 but a series of events.
00:16:23 Were you amazed at how many events
00:16:25 occurred in 66 C.E.?
00:16:27 And that was just a brief summary.
00:16:31 There were many divisive political
00:16:34 and religious issues
00:16:35 that could have been  distracting to Christians.
00:16:39 So those Christians
00:16:41 needed to remain focused on their hope.
00:16:44 They needed to remember
00:16:46 that Jerusalem and its temple
00:16:48 gave no security for them.
00:16:52 Why should we be so interested
00:16:54 in all of this today?
00:16:57 Notice what else Jesus said,
00:16:59 as recorded at Luke chapter 21,
00:17:02 verses 34 through 36:
00:17:06 “Pay attention to yourselves
00:17:09 “that your hearts never become weighed down
00:17:11 “with overeating and heavy drinking
00:17:14 “and anxieties of life,
00:17:16 “and suddenly that day
00:17:18 “be instantly upon you as a snare.
00:17:21 “For it will come upon all those
00:17:23 “dwelling on the face of the whole earth.
00:17:26 “Keep awake, then,
00:17:28 “all the time making supplication
00:17:31 “that you may succeed in escaping
00:17:33 “all these things that must occur
00:17:36 and in standing before the Son of man.”
00:17:41 Jesus said that these things would occur
00:17:44 “on the face of the whole earth.”
00:17:48 That means he wasn’t just talking about Christians in the first century;
00:17:53 he was talking about us today.
00:17:57 Yes, we need to pay attention and be alert.
00:18:01 He also reminded us to make supplication,
00:18:05 yes, to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.
00:18:12 What does this mean for us today?
00:18:15 As we face the great tribulation, brothers and sisters,
00:18:19 we don’t know exactly all the details of what will happen,
00:18:23 but we do know that Jesus did not mean
00:18:27 that we would have to flee from one literal city
00:18:30 or go to a certain mountain range.
00:18:32 How could we?
00:18:34 We’re scattered over the whole face of the earth.
00:18:37 But we do need to remember the same things
00:18:40 that the first-century Christians needed to remember.
00:18:44 Don’t put our trust
00:18:47 in the religious and political systems of Satan’s world.
00:18:51 Why is this so vital?
00:18:54 Just as in 66 C.E.,
00:18:56 today we see one event after another
00:18:59 leading up to the final day.
00:19:02 Everywhere there is evidence
00:19:05 of political instability and infighting
00:19:08 not only among nations but also within nations.
00:19:13 Religious, political, and social issues
00:19:16 —including abortion and homosexuality—
00:19:19 have become divisive topics.
00:19:22 Scientific issues, such as global warming,
00:19:25 have also become political issues.
00:19:30 Just as in the first century,
00:19:33 we must take to heart Jesus’ warning:
00:19:36 Don’t take sides in the chaos
00:19:38 that’s happening all around us.
00:19:40 Yes, keep your focus on the Kingdom hope.
00:19:50 Remember, soon we will face events
00:19:55 that will test our integrity as never before.
00:19:59 So, what are the takeaway points?
00:20:01 Well, first of all, we realize
00:20:04 that now is the time we need to make decisions
00:20:07 and stick to those decisions.
00:20:09 Yes, we need to be absolutely determined
00:20:13 not to put our faith and trust in worldly politics.
00:20:16 We need to remain neutral, always thinking of God’s Kingdom.
00:20:21 We also need to remember that it’s not just one event coming up in the future.
00:20:26 It can be a series of events
00:20:28 all happening at the same time that could be distracting.
00:20:31 But if we have made up our decision now,
00:20:34 we’ll be ready for that time.
00:20:36 And also we remember the need to keep
00:20:39 our relationship strong with Jehovah God.
00:20:42 And we remember the compassion of Jesus.
00:20:45 So Jehovah and Jesus want us
00:20:47 to be protected at that time.
00:20:50 So may we be determined
00:20:52 to continue to be alert and decisive!
