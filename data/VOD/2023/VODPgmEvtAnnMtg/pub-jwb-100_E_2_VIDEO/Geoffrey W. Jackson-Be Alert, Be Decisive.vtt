00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:05.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are living in the last of the last days.

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:11.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means soon we are going to face events

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:15.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will test our integrity as never before.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, now is the time

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to be alert and decisive.

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:27.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a similar situation
to what our brothers

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:30.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
found themselves in in the first century.

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they had some dramatic events
that faced them.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the events

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
that early Christians had to deal with,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how did Jesus prepare them
to face those events?

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does it mean for us today?

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:55.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
I’d like you to imagine this scene.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:01:00.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll go back in time to Nisan 9, 33 C.E.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what happened on that day?

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:06.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was mounted on a donkey.

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in your mind, can you visualize it?

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:12.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re with Jesus
as he starts to go down the area

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:14.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the Mount of Olives in the Kidron Valley,

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:18.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looking up toward the city of Jerusalem,
what happens?

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
The crowds start to gather
—more and more people.

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
People start throwing
their garments on the road;

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:27.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
others cut down branches
and wave them around.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:31.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
They call out: “Blessed is the one
who comes in Jehovah’s name!”

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole city is in an uproar!

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:36.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
How exciting that would have been!

00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, at that exciting moment in his life,

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:47.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus started sobbing and crying.

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:49.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:53.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to the record in Luke chapter 19

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:56.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke chapter 19

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 41 through 44.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here the inspired account tells us

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:06.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “when [Jesus] got nearby,

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he viewed the city

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and wept over it,

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:16.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saying: ‘If you, even you,
had discerned on this day

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:20.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the things having to do with peace

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘—but now they have been hidden
from your eyes.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Because the days will come upon you

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘when your enemies will build around you
a fortification of pointed stakes

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:35.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and will encircle you
and besiege you from every side.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:41.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will dash you
and your children within you to the ground,

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and they will not leave a stone
upon a stone in you,

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you did not discern
the time of your being inspected.’”

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we see from these verses?

00:02:55.124 --> 00:03:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the compassion
Jesus had for those who would be killed

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jerusalem was to be destroyed?

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he was envisioning the destruction

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would occur in the year 70 C.E.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was moved by the emotions of that

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:17.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so much so that he cried loudly,

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
not silently

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
(like he did when
he was about to resurrect Lazarus)

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
but audibly and loudly.

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we learn from this?

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for a start, we can see Jehovah’s love

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
for people as reflected in Jesus.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was very distraught
thinking about what would happen

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that city and its inhabitants.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 44,

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:47.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was the other thing
that Jesus was distressed about?

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:50.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
That that was a time

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:54.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
of judgment, we might say, or inspection.

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even though Jesus
was thinking ahead to future events,

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
he realized that they
were missing the opportunity at that time

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:09.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
—things that they needed to
do to prepare for the future.

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something else that we learn too.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:18.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only do we learn
from the compassion that Jesus displayed

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:20.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which we should likewise display

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:24.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we think about what’s
going to happen to this wicked world)

00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:29.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also if Jesus
had so much emotion and feeling

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
about wicked people
who were about to be destroyed,

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:35.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think he felt about his followers?

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:38.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think he wanted to prepare them?

00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:39.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:42.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why we’re not surprised
that two days later

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:47.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took aside his apostles
and gave them some instructions.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn there to the record

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Luke 21:20-22.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is recorded as saying:

00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:02.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when you see Jerusalem
surrounded by encamped armies

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now in this case,
he’s referring to 66 C.E.],

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then know that the desolating
of her has drawn near.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then let those in Judea
begin fleeing to the mountains,

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let those in the midst of her

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, in the midst of Jerusalem] leave,

00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:24.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let those in the countryside

00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:28.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not enter into her
[or, enter into Jerusalem],

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because these are days
for meting out justice

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:36.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order that all the things
written may be fulfilled.”

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:43.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that there were three groups
of his followers that he was referring to?

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spoke about those who lived “in Judea,”

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that wasn’t just Jerusalem;
that was the surrounding area.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they were told: ‘Get out of there.

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Flee; go to the mountains.’

00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he spoke to those
who would be living in Jerusalem.

00:05:58.374 --> 00:05:59.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what did he say?

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Leave the city.’

00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:05.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the third group,
those who would live “in the countryside”

00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:07.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we know many people were farmers,

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:12.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they lived in open areas,
doing agriculture.

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:14.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Normally, what would be expected

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:18.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that if armies
were to come to a certain area,

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:21.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
these people would flee
into the fortified city.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:25.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what Jesus told them
to do was the opposite.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no matter where his followers would be,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether in the countryside,
in the city, or in the general area,

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was the common denominator?

00:06:38.614 --> 00:06:41.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t flee to the city.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t put your trust in Jerusalem.

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus was telling them
what they needed to know

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the events would occur.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:58.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what really was the lesson

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:02.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was impressing on these ones?

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:07.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, although those
he was speaking to at that time were Jewish,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had to realize that Jerusalem

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:14.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
was no longer the earthly seat
of Jehovah’s Kingdom.

00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to also realize that the temple

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
was no longer
the center of Jehovah’s worship.

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Christians had to get those facts
clearly in mind

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make their decisions at that time,

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
prior to the events that would come later.

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe we could illustrate
in the modern sense.

00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:43.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us have had to face the issue
with regard to blood transfusions.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:48.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
When do you need to make your decision
with regard to that?

00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it when you’re in the ambulance,
semiconscious, in pain?

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:56.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it, “Oh, give me the DPA;

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you read the fine print”?

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it when you get
into the emergency operating room

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:08.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you start arguing with people
and asking questions?

00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:10.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realize that now is the time

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:17.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to make our decisions.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we need to live by those decisions.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then if an emergency should occur,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be ready for that situation.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:31.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the lesson Jesus was teaching them.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the Christians back in the first century

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to rid themselves
of any feelings of nationalistic pride,

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:42.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
any feelings that Jerusalem was the city.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:46.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they would make
the wrong decision.

00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:49.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was especially true

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the year 66 C.E.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened in that year?

00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider a brief overview.

00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us are familiar with what happened

00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:05.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the end of 66 C.E.

00:09:05.661 --> 00:09:07.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, the Roman army,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the leadership of Cestius Gallus,

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
attacked Jerusalem.

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
But unexpectedly, they retreated,

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing time for Christians in the city

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
to flee Jerusalem.

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that the only thing that happened

00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:27.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the year 66 C.E.?

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:30.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look back in time

00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:35.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what other events took place.

00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:38.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help us understand why Christians

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:42.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to be alert and decisive beforehand.

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s think about the background.

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:49.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jewish nation was fed up

00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:51.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Roman taxation and corruption

00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:53.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
way back in Jesus’ day.

00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:56.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by the beginning of 66 C.E.,

00:09:56.912 --> 00:10:00.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
the situation was even worse.

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:03.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Roman governor of Judea, Gessius Florus,

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:05.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
was totally corrupt

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:09.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was notorious for his cruelty.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:12.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spirit of rebellion was everywhere.

00:10:12.828 --> 00:10:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judea was a powder keg ready to explode.

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:21.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the spring of 66 C.E.,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Florus plundered the temple treasury in Jerusalem,

00:10:24.573 --> 00:10:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
stealing some 17 talents.

00:10:27.343 --> 00:10:29.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
This caused a revolt among the Jews.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
In retaliation, Florus ordered his soldiers

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attack the rebels and allowed his soldiers

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
to plunder hundreds of homes

00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:42.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to kill some 3,600 Jews.

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:47.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the Roman assault was repelled,

00:10:47.263 --> 00:10:50.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Florus and his men retreated from the city.

00:10:54.804 --> 00:10:56.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were there at that time,

00:10:56.872 --> 00:10:58.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
how would you have reacted?

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:03.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you have been outraged by Florus’ action?

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you lived in the countryside,

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you think the Romans may return

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now was the time to flee to Jerusalem?

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians needed to be alert and decisive.

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:20.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was not important to Christians.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not the place of safety.

00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:29.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened next?

00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:32.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eleazar, the son of High Priest Ananias,

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:35.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
gained control of the temple area.

00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:38.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
He suspended the sacrifices offered to the emperor

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then drove the remaining Romans

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of the upper part of the city.

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:48.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were there,

00:11:48.758 --> 00:11:50.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you have been proud,

00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:52.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy that the corrupt Romans

00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:55.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
were forced to leave?

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, though,

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:59.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was not important to Christians.

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:02.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not the place of safety.

00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:05.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians needed to be alert

00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:08.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decisive and not distracted.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then around July/August,

00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:15.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Menahem, the leader of another Jewish faction,

00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:18.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
overran the Roman fortress of Masada

00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:21.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seized Roman weapons from there.

00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:26.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then returned to Jerusalem

00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:30.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and captured the Tower, or Fortress, of Antonia.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
They set fire to Herod’s palace,

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the palaces of Agrippa and Bernice,

00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:39.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as High Priest Ananias’ home.

00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:42.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they ordered the murder

00:12:42.578 --> 00:12:46.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
of High Priest Ananias and his brother Hezekiah.

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:47.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following that,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
they returned to the Fortress of Antonia

00:12:50.386 --> 00:12:52.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and massacred the garrison

00:12:52.388 --> 00:12:55.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Roman soldiers still there.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city was divided and in an uproar,

00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:00.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Menahem and his men

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:02.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
escaped back to Masada.

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:06.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see how easy it would have been

00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:08.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
to join sides with one of the factions?

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:12.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, though, these events

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
were not important to Christians.

00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:18.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
They needed to be alert and decisive

00:13:18.614 --> 00:13:21.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not distracted.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, around November,

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cestius Gallus, the governor of Syria,

00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
marched with his troops

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
encamped about six miles from Jerusalem.

00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though it was a Sabbath day,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish rebels streamed out of the city

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made a hasty assault on the Romans.

00:13:40.603 --> 00:13:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Romans retreated to Beth-horon,

00:13:42.605 --> 00:13:44.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Jews captured

00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:46.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Roman supplies and weapons.

00:13:47.042 --> 00:13:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Agrippa sent two representatives,

00:13:49.945 --> 00:13:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
his personal friends,

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:53.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Jewish rebels

00:13:53.148 --> 00:13:55.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
to persuade them to lay down their weapons

00:13:55.684 --> 00:13:58.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to promise them clemency.

00:13:58.521 --> 00:14:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the rebels killed one of the men

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wounded the other.

00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:07.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cestius pursued the rebels to Jerusalem,

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
camped at Mount Scopus for three days,

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then started to undermine the city wall

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tried to set fire to the gate of the temple.

00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:23.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, for some unexpected reason,

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gallus and his army retreated.

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:29.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alert Christians in Jerusalem and Judea

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:33.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
immediately acted decisively and fled.

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:36.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rebels chased the Roman army,

00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:38.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
inflicting considerable losses

00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:40.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
in both men and supplies,

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:43.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gallus ordered his soldiers to retreat.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
After seven days,

00:14:46.602 --> 00:14:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish rebels gave up chasing the Romans

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:52.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pillaged the supplies left behind.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:56.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
They returned to Jerusalem after eight days.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the situation in Jerusalem at that time?

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:04.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josephus says:

00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:06.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In [the] face of the exhilaration

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which now seized Jerusalem

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:11.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the spokesmen for peace [with Rome]

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:14.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were obliged to remain silent. . . .

00:15:14.697 --> 00:15:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even those opposed to the war

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:18.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were swept along by the force

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:21.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the circumstances.”

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who supported Rome left.

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:25.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All the rest

00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:28.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were won over to the side of the rebels,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
partly by force, partly by persuasion.”

00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:35.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were there,

00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:37.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
what would you have done?

00:15:38.654 --> 00:15:41.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many Jews started to flee to Jerusalem,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeking refuge there.

00:15:44.226 --> 00:15:46.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was it a safe refuge?

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was anarchy in the city.

00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:54.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several Jewish political factions fought each other.

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:56.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, in 70 C.E.,

00:15:56.705 --> 00:16:00.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was destroyed along with its temple.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Christians who were alert

00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:04.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decisive were safe,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
far away in Pella,

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:09.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the other side of the Jordan River.

00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:12.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn from this brief review

00:16:12.988 --> 00:16:15.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the events of 66 C.E.?

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:20.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t just one event
—was it?—

00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:23.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a series of events.

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:25.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you amazed at how many events

00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:27.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
occurred in 66 C.E.?

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was just a brief summary.

00:16:31.607 --> 00:16:34.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many divisive political

00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:35.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and religious issues

00:16:35.544 --> 00:16:38.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could have been 
distracting to Christians.

00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:41.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those Christians

00:16:41.483 --> 00:16:44.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to remain focused on their hope.

00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:46.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
They needed to remember

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:48.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jerusalem and its temple

00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:50.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave no security for them.

00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:54.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should we be so interested

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of this today?

00:16:57.499 --> 00:16:59.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what else Jesus said,

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Luke chapter 21,

00:17:02.304 --> 00:17:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 34 through 36:

00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:09.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pay attention to yourselves

00:17:09.178 --> 00:17:11.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

00:17:11.814 --> 00:17:14.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking

00:17:14.516 --> 00:17:16.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and anxieties of life,

00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and suddenly that day

00:17:18.087 --> 00:17:20.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it will come upon all those

00:17:23.892 --> 00:17:26.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“dwelling on the face of the whole earth.

00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:28.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep awake, then,

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:31.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all the time making supplication

00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:33.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you may succeed in escaping

00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:36.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all these things that must occur

00:17:36.004 --> 00:17:38.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in standing before the Son of man.”

00:17:41.376 --> 00:17:44.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that these things would occur

00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:47.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the face of the whole earth.”

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means he wasn’t just talking
about Christians in the first century;

00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:55.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was talking about us today.

00:17:57.493 --> 00:18:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to pay attention and be alert.

00:18:01.764 --> 00:18:05.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also reminded us to make supplication,

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, to strengthen
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean for us today?

00:18:15.077 --> 00:18:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we face the great tribulation,
brothers and sisters,

00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:23.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t know exactly
all the details of what will happen,

00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:27.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know that Jesus did not mean

00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would have to flee
from one literal city

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:32.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
or go to a certain mountain range.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could we?

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:37.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re scattered
over the whole face of the earth.

00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:40.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do need to remember the same things

00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:43.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the first-century Christians
needed to remember.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:47.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t put our trust

00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:51.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the religious
and political systems of Satan’s world.

00:18:51.847 --> 00:18:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this so vital?

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:56.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as in 66 C.E.,

00:18:56.985 --> 00:18:59.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
today we see one event after another

00:18:59.922 --> 00:19:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading up to the final day.

00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:05.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everywhere there is evidence

00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:08.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
of political instability and infighting

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only among nations
but also within nations.

00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:16.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Religious, political, and social issues

00:19:16.772 --> 00:19:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
—including abortion and homosexuality—

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
have become divisive topics.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:25.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Scientific issues, such as global warming,

00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:28.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
have also become political issues.

00:19:30.853 --> 00:19:33.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as in the first century,

00:19:33.021 --> 00:19:36.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must take to heart Jesus’ warning:

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:38.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t take sides in the chaos

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s happening all around us.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:44.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, keep your focus on the Kingdom hope.

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:55.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, soon we will face events

00:19:55.043 --> 00:19:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will test our integrity as never before.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are the takeaway points?

00:20:01.984 --> 00:20:04.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, we realize

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:07.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
that now is the time we need
to make decisions

00:20:07.055 --> 00:20:09.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stick to those decisions.

00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:13.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to be absolutely determined

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:16.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to put our faith
and trust in worldly politics.

00:20:16.765 --> 00:20:21.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to remain neutral,
always thinking of God’s Kingdom.

00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:26.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also need to remember that it’s
not just one event coming up in the future.

00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:28.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be a series of events

00:20:28.377 --> 00:20:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
all happening at the same time
that could be distracting.

00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we have made up our decision now,

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be ready for that time.

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:39.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also we remember the need to keep

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:42.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
our relationship strong with Jehovah God.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remember the compassion of Jesus.

00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:47.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah and Jesus want us

00:20:47.763 --> 00:20:50.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be protected at that time.

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:52.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we be determined

00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:57.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to be alert and decisive!
