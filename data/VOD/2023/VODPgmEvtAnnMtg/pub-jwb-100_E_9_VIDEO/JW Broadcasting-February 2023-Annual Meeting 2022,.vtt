Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
for February 2023!

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.410 line:10% position:50% align:center
In January’s program,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.280 line:10% position:50% align:center
we watched Part 1 of the annual meeting.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.948 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the live event,

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.150 line:10% position:50% align:center
there was an air of excitement.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
The audience was eagerly awaiting
what would be announced next.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now that same excitement
can be shared with all of you.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we always enjoy hearing
from our dear Brother Herd.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s he going to talk
to us about today?

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he is going to talk on the theme

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are You a Joyful Person?”

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:01.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Herd, please.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think of your brain,

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:10.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
view it as a box that contains
all sorts of information

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:13.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
—good and bad.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think of your heart,

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
view it as a bottle

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:20.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
that contains only good information.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now listen to this vintage, old, 1950’s

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy dishwashing liquid soap commercial:

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Joy in a bottle beats anything in a box.”

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:39.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
True joy from the heart

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:42.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
beats a head full of knowledge.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about it?

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a joyful person?

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
What good is it?

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible says:

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:57.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A joyful heart
makes for a cheerful countenance.”

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it goes on to say:

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A heart that is joyful
does good to the body.”

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this work?

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:13.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times,
your heart will make you smile

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
when your body is in pain.

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
you pass another person

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he or she says, “How are you?”

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:26.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
You smile and say, “Good.”

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:32.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your back, feet, and legs are killing you,

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:36.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
but your heart
won’t let you give a negative answer.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are other more important reasons
to be joyful.

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:47.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one:
Jehovah is a joyful person.

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:53.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Timothy 1:11,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is called “the happy God.”

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a synonym is the “joyful” God.

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rejoices in his work.

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we know that?

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at the 104th Psalm

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 31:

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Synonyms are having “joy, or delight,”

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his works.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, secondly,
Jesus too is a happy worker.

00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:41.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Timothy chapter 6,

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:45.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 14 and 15,

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s called “the happy . . . Potentate.”

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Potentate is a powerful ruler.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he is happy.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:58.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was prophesied of him

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:01.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 40:8:

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:05.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To do your will, O my God,

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:07.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
is my delight.”

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:15.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this means “to please greatly.”

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:19.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to John 4:34,

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:23.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doing of God’s work was food for him.

00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:27.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
It energized him and sustained him.

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:31.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing God’s will was like butter on his bread

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:33.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
and milk in his glass.

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:38.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to rejoice in our work.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me, please,

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:47.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 5:19:

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:52.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, when the true God gives a man

00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:54.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“riches and material possessions

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:58.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with the ability to enjoy them,

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he should take his reward

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and rejoice in his hard work.

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:09.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the gift of God.”

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Housewives and mothers,

00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:14.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Husbands and fathers,

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:23.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Single men and women,

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Widows and widowers,

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in your work.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Old folks,

00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice in whatever you’re able to do

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just call it work.

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:45.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to be joyful.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 16:15

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
comments this way:

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:56.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah your God will bless . . .

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all that you do,

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will become nothing but joyful.”

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best fathers are happy fathers.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best husbands are happy husbands.

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:14.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best mothers are happy mothers.

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:17.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best children are obedient children

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
—oops, I mean are happy children.

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:28.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Singing upbuilding songs produces joy.

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:31.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Levite males sang at the temple.

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, other singers (men and women)

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
are spoken of in Scripture.

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:42.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 16:25, it says:

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:45.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But about the middle of the night,

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul and Silas were praying

00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:52.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and praising God with song,

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prisoners were listening to them.”

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slaves used to sing while working.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did this to pass the time

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lift their spirits to the highest joy.

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sang out their struggle

00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
—weariness, loneliness,

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:17.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
sorrow, hope,

00:07:17.453 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and determination for a better life.

00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can sing in the shower,

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:27.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
just make sure no one is listening.

00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:31.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Count your blessings.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bathe in the joy that they bring you.

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:40.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy is an aspect of God’s holy spirit.

00:07:41.777 --> 00:07:46.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the second of the nine aspects

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:50.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Galatians 5:22.

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray daily for God’s holy spirit
to be with you in your life.

00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:02.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me Daniel chapter 6,

00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 10 and 11:

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:09.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But as soon as Daniel knew
that the decree had been signed,

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he went to his house,

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which had the windows of his roof chamber

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:19.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“open toward Jerusalem.

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:21.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And three times a day

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:25.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he got down on his knees

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:27.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and prayed

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:31.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and offered praise before his God,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he had regularly done prior to this.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:39.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time those men burst in

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and found Daniel petitioning

00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:47.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pleading for favor before his God.”

00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:51.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife, Gloria, and I

00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:54.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to get down on our knees

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pray before going to bed.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we’re old,
we just sit on the side of the bed and pray.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:04.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we get down, we can’t get up.

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:10.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind
that prayer will produce in you joy.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:16.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not alone;
Jehovah is with you.

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:20.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is never far away.

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:23.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 17:27,

00:09:23.412 --> 00:09:26.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul told some in Athens:

00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:30.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is not far off from each one of us.”

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:36.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can see you
and hear you from heaven,

00:09:36.525 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever heaven is located.

00:09:40.062 --> 00:09:45.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never should we feel that we are alone.

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each minute of every day,

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:53.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is right beside us,

00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:57.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for opportunities to help us.

00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to him regularly.

00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask him to give you joy.

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:09.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Angels too are joyful.

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 15:10 says that they’re joyful.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please look at it as we read it:

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:20.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the same way, I tell you,

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:25.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“joy arises among the angels of God

00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:28.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
over one sinner who repents.”

00:10:29.478 --> 00:10:31.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:33.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a joyful person?

00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:39.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to remember the box.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put your mind to it.

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:47.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the bottle—put your heart into it.

00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:51.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Copy as best you can

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are joyful

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah, Jesus,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angels,

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:04.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:08.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray daily for a joyful countenance.

00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:13.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
A warm smile does good to the body.

00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
One secular song makes this point.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t sing it.

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:22.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll just say it:

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:26.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Light up your face with gladness.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:31.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hide every trace of sadness.

00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:36.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although a tear may be ever so near,

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:41.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that’s the time you must keep on trying.

00:11:41.717 --> 00:11:45.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Smile, what’s the use of crying?

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ll find that life is still worthwhile

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:52.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you just smile.”

00:11:55.197 --> 00:11:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are a joyful person,
thank Jehovah.

00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are lacking joy,
work on being more joyful.

00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:09.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,

00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:12.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you to be

00:12:12.348 --> 00:12:15.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
nothing but joyful.

00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:17.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s make it our aim

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to please him with joy.

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:31.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that delightful?

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Sam.

00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:35.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was just wonderful.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to watch two videos.

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is going to bring us up-to-date

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the construction projects

00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:47.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were finished just before COVID began.

00:12:47.249 --> 00:12:50.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then it’s also going to tell us

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:54.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the work that was done
during the COVID outbreak.

00:12:54.223 --> 00:12:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers did not stop working
during the outbreak,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were very resourceful.

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:01.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did a lot of good things.

00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:03.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s watch this video.

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to be very encouraging.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:10.573 line:10% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 40:4, 5,

00:13:10.573 --> 00:13:12.241 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says he would remove

00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:15.311 line:10% position:50% align:center
seemingly insurmountable obstacles

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:18.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the Jews could return to Jerusalem.

00:13:18.314 --> 00:13:19.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account says:

00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:22.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let every valley be raised up,

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:13:25.988 --> 00:13:28.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The rough ground must become level,

00:13:28.157 --> 00:13:30.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the rugged ground a valley plain.

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The glory of Jehovah will be revealed,

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:35.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all flesh will see it together,

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:39.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.”

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
This inspiring prophecy

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
was initially fulfilled in 537 B.C.E.

00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:48.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing that can stand in the way

00:13:48.844 --> 00:13:51.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what Jehovah wants accomplished.

00:13:51.647 --> 00:13:54.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this report, we will see clear evidence

00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s support
on theocratic projects today

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite a pandemic, supply chain shortages,

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other challenges.

00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:06.529 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:08.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
the February 2020 announcement

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:11.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
featured in the JW Newsroom

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:15.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
informed us
that the Cameroon branch relocation project

00:14:15.004 --> 00:14:19.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
finished shortly before the outbreak
of COVID-19.

00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:22.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just in time, the Bethel family had a home

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:26.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they could safely shelter in place
during the pandemic and still care

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:30.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Kingdom work
and more than 48,000 publishers

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:32.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that branch territory.

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:34.857 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Argentina Bethel family

00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:37.259 line:10% position:50% align:center
also moved into their new branch facility

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:40.362 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Buenos Aires shortly thereafter.

00:14:40.362 --> 00:14:45.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
The move, which was organized
in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols,

00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:47.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
began in July 2021.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bethel family saw numerous examples

00:14:51.073 --> 00:14:54.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah leveling out
overwhelming challenges

00:14:54.376 --> 00:14:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the pandemic.

00:14:56.512 --> 00:15:00.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
The successful completion
of the new branch facilities

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of that turmoil

00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
has already given
a great witness to the community.

00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has allowed the Bethel family to focus

00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:12.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
on caring for close to 170,000 publishers

00:15:12.928 --> 00:15:15.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that branch territory.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing to have these new facilities

00:15:18.901 --> 00:15:22.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the Kingdom preaching work!

00:15:22.104 --> 00:15:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about projects happening right now?

00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen closely as we hear updates
from brothers in Italy,

00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:33.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Congo, and Angola.

00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Italy branch is relocating its facilities

00:15:38.387 --> 00:15:40.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the city of Bologna in northern Italy,

00:15:40.756 --> 00:15:43.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is located about 370 kilometers,

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:46.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 230 miles, from Rome.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.799 line:10% position:50% align:center
Initially, the Construction Project Committee

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:52.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
wanted to use our brothers and sisters

00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:54.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
as volunteers.

00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:57.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, at a certain point, it was decided

00:15:57.106 --> 00:16:00.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rely on an outside development company,

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:05.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
both for the design and renovation
of the office building that was purchased

00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:09.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as for the design and construction
of the residential buildings.

00:16:11.587 --> 00:16:13.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
When this decision was made,

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:16.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did not imagine
that a few months afterward

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would not be able to use our volunteers

00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:21.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at the beginning of 2020,

00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
COVID-19 struck northern Italy,

00:16:24.033 --> 00:16:26.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the city of Bologna.

00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:31.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a consequence, the government
suspended activities, including construction.

00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:37.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
After about one month,
they lifted the restrictions.

00:16:37.312 --> 00:16:39.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result,

00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:43.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could get back in touch with the companies
and continue the work

00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:46.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
while respecting government protocol

00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:49.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and direction from our organization.

00:16:49.992 --> 00:16:51.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to Jehovah’s direction,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the pandemic,

00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:55.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are happy to see how this project

00:16:55.998 --> 00:16:59.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
is moving forward
much faster than we expected.

00:16:59.034 --> 00:17:01.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we look forward to being able

00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:03.272 line:10% position:50% align:center
to move into these new buildings

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.307 line:10% position:50% align:center
by the end of 2024.

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:09.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 2012, we had a little over

00:17:09.178 --> 00:17:13.882 line:10% position:50% align:center
168,000 publishers in our branch territory.

00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:18.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the end of 2021,
the total number of publishers grew

00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:22.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to more than 209,000 publishers.

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because it was impractical
to expand the branch facility in Kinshasa,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
we looked for property
that could care for the immediate

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:32.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future needs of the branch.

00:17:32.434 --> 00:17:34.536 line:10% position:50% align:center
We purchased property

00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:37.172 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the country’s second-largest city,

00:17:37.172 --> 00:17:38.474 line:10% position:50% align:center
Lubumbashi,

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.742 line:10% position:50% align:center
where a developer

00:17:39.742 --> 00:17:43.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
was already building housing
and office units.

00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:46.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
The developer already had
the zoning, permits,

00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:49.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and completed design packages.

00:17:49.418 --> 00:17:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
This saved much time
and allowed the project to move ahead

00:17:53.188 --> 00:17:56.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
with minimal disruption
even during the pandemic,

00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were happy for that.

00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:01.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the internal work of the new offices,

00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:03.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed a contractor

00:18:03.932 --> 00:18:08.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could design and install
to the standards of our organization

00:18:08.771 --> 00:18:11.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and within the project budget.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew this would be hard to find in Congo

00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:18.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and even harder
with the limitations of the pandemic.

00:18:18.614 --> 00:18:20.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the suppliers that we use

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:24.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
for food and relief supplies in the area

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:27.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned to us
that they have a partner company

00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
who specializes in construction

00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:31.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is newly active in the country.

00:18:31.994 --> 00:18:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t expect
that the answer to this challenge

00:18:35.397 --> 00:18:37.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
would come from this unusual direction.

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:42.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we were surprised to find
that they did in fact qualify

00:18:42.137 --> 00:18:47.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the high standards and expectations
of such a branch project.

00:18:47.075 --> 00:18:49.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the relationship grew, we saw

00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:52.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
fine collaboration between our teams,

00:18:52.447 --> 00:18:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they continue to work along with us
now as the project expands.

00:18:57.486 --> 00:18:59.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly have seen

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:03.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah smoothing out the path
for this project.

00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:05.227 line:10% position:50% align:center
We have already started moving

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.596 line:10% position:50% align:center
some Bethelites to this new site

00:19:07.596 --> 00:19:10.265 line:10% position:50% align:center
and look forward to the project’s completion

00:19:10.265 --> 00:19:12.234 line:10% position:50% align:center
in mid-2024.

00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:16.438 line:10% position:50% align:center
In December 2021,

00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:19.408 line:10% position:50% align:center
a building was purchased that will provide

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.577 line:10% position:50% align:center
additional rooms and offices

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:24.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Bethel family at our branch.

00:19:26.014 --> 00:19:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
This building is located
about a ten-minute walk

00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:31.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the current Bethel facility.

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:36.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the restrictions
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:19:36.491 --> 00:19:40.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire process
for the acquisition of this building,

00:19:40.362 --> 00:19:43.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
even including the verification
of the legal aspects,

00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:46.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to be done by videoconference.

00:19:47.836 --> 00:19:51.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the last week
of the negotiation process

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there were just five days remaining
to sign the purchase and sale agreement

00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:57.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and during a stage

00:19:57.946 --> 00:20:01.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which the negotiation team
from the branch and the seller

00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:04.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
had already agreed
on the purchase and sale price,

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discovered that the structure
of the building needed some repairs

00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:12.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reinforcement in some areas.

00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:16.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the team negotiating the purchase
handle this obstacle?

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
The seller was asked
to take responsibility for the repairs

00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to reinforce the building’s structure,

00:20:27.376 --> 00:20:31.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
closely following the engineering details
that would be provided by the branch.

00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:36.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
After several prayers
by the branch’s negotiation team,

00:20:37.786 --> 00:20:40.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
the seller accepted the responsibility

00:20:41.924 --> 00:20:45.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even paid for all the expenses
involved in this repair.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
The repair was completed.

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:52.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And shortly after,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work to completely renovate the building
began.

00:20:56.438 --> 00:20:58.707 line:10% position:50% align:center
We look forward to seeing

00:20:58.707 --> 00:21:00.509 line:10% position:50% align:center
some of the Bethel family

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:04.746 line:10% position:50% align:center
move into this new building in early 2024.

00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:09.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to these new branch facilities,

00:21:09.217 --> 00:21:12.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also have many other needs to fill.

00:21:12.454 --> 00:21:16.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in order to train
brothers and sisters

00:21:16.325 --> 00:21:18.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out the preaching and teaching work,

00:21:18.593 --> 00:21:22.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
there continues to be a need
for theocratic school facilities.

00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:27.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Madagascar,
the branch hosted classes at Bethel

00:21:27.936 --> 00:21:31.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they didn’t have
any other suitable facilities.

00:21:32.674 --> 00:21:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in June 2021,
they finished construction

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a new school facility

00:21:38.347 --> 00:21:42.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will now be able to schedule
up to four classes there each year.

00:21:43.285 --> 00:21:44.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently,

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:47.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are over 40 existing school facilities

00:21:47.622 --> 00:21:48.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have around 20

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
active school facility projects

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:53.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
at various stages of development.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about facilities to support

00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:00.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
the growing media production
of the organization?

00:22:00.302 --> 00:22:04.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to report
that we have finished the studio projects

00:22:04.272 --> 00:22:07.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the South Africa and Australasia branches.

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:09.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Australasia,

00:22:09.177 --> 00:22:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
that includes the backlot that is used

00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
for <i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>
video series.

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:18.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, if Jehovah wills,

00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will begin construction
on the new site in Ramapo, New York.

00:22:22.124 --> 00:22:24.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to seeing how Jehovah

00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:26.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
uses this facility

00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:28.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
to care for the needs of his people.

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:33.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is clear that neither the pandemic

00:22:33.135 --> 00:22:36.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor ongoing turmoil in this world

00:22:36.004 --> 00:22:40.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been able to stop
theocratic building projects.

00:22:40.308 --> 00:22:44.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as world conditions
continue to deteriorate,

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:48.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are confident
that the words of Isaiah 40:4, 5

00:22:48.817 --> 00:22:51.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be true for us.

00:22:51.153 --> 00:22:53.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah will help us overcome

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:57.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
any mountainlike obstacles that we face.

00:22:57.626 --> 00:23:00.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
We earnestly pray for Jehovah to bless these

00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:03.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future building projects.

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:07.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank you dear brothers and sisters

00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:11.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
for supporting them by means of your prayers,

00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:15.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
skills, time, and resources.

00:23:15.577 --> 00:23:20.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all praise and glory
go to our great God, Jehovah,

00:23:20.582 --> 00:23:24.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
who continues to clear the way for us!

00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:36.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s hand is never short.

00:23:36.064 --> 00:23:39.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the next part is a video entitled 

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Patterson Visitors’ Center Update.</i>

00:23:44.106 --> 00:23:46.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try saying that fast three times.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:51.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a mouthful
—<i>Patterson Visitors’ Center Update.</i>

00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is about more
than just a visitors’ center

00:23:55.317 --> 00:23:59.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
where people can come to wait
their turn to tour Bethel.

00:23:59.154 --> 00:24:01.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to see
that there are some surprises

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
waiting for us in this visitors’ center.

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:09.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
Planning for the new

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:12.767 line:10% position:50% align:center
Patterson Visitors’ Center began in 2018.

00:24:13.668 --> 00:24:16.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
A project development group was formed

00:24:16.104 --> 00:24:18.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the goal of starting construction,

00:24:18.273 --> 00:24:22.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
but unforeseen challenges
were about to occur.

00:24:22.677 --> 00:24:25.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
In March of 2020,
an outbreak of COVID-19

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the New York area

00:24:27.249 --> 00:24:30.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused Bethel to go into a full lockdown.

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:33.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the design group
see Jehovah’s blessing on the project

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this unprecedented time?

00:24:39.294 --> 00:24:40.662 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, when Bethel locked down

00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:42.430 line:10% position:50% align:center
and suspended in-person meetings,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.232 line:10% position:50% align:center
so did the town of Patterson.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
This created a serious challenge
for us to obtain the necessary approvals

00:24:49.104 --> 00:24:52.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep the project moving forward.

00:24:52.007 --> 00:24:55.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with the threat of falling months behind,

00:24:55.177 --> 00:24:58.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to rely on Jehovah
and alter our approach.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a local elder was given permission

00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:04.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the town planning board meetings
in person once they opened up.

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed us, as a design team,

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:09.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a presentation
effectively but remotely.

00:25:10.892 --> 00:25:14.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw Jehovah’s hand
and his blessing on this entire arrangement.

00:25:14.996 --> 00:25:18.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
So through months of meetings,
we were able to get the approvals needed

00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:19.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then get a building permit

00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:21.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin construction

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:24.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of this taking place
during the lockdown!

00:25:27.142 --> 00:25:28.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following all the local guidelines,

00:25:28.743 --> 00:25:32.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch found a way
to bring skilled brothers and sisters

00:25:32.814 --> 00:25:34.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the “Bethel bubble” safely

00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:36.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they could work on the project.

00:25:37.352 --> 00:25:41.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah caused many volunteers
to “offer themselves willingly” to help.

00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:46.228 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here we are,

00:25:46.228 --> 00:25:48.163 line:10% position:50% align:center
building the Patterson Visitors’ Center

00:25:48.163 --> 00:25:50.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
during a most unique time in history,

00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:53.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of a global pandemic.

00:25:54.369 --> 00:25:57.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brotherhood
has demonstrated ‘a heart for the work’

00:25:57.839 --> 00:26:00.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
through contributions

00:26:00.008 --> 00:26:02.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brothers and sisters
offering their skills

00:26:02.544 --> 00:26:05.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of which are quite unique.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so encouraging to see

00:26:07.048 --> 00:26:09.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has come to our aid

00:26:09.451 --> 00:26:11.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
with supply issues

00:26:11.686 --> 00:26:13.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Bethel departments have cooperated

00:26:13.955 --> 00:26:16.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provided skilled people to help us.

00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:18.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been so encouraging.

00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:21.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
All involved have seen Jehovah’s hand
guiding the way

00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:24.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
through these challenging circumstances.

00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:26.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some may wonder,

00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:29.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘At a time when guests
are not allowed on Bethel property,

00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:33.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
why is this visitors’ center
so important to Jehovah?’

00:26:34.709 --> 00:26:38.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
The physical buildings
at Bethel are attractive,

00:26:38.046 --> 00:26:42.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what’s more valuable to Jehovah
is what happens inside.

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:45.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the spiritual gift that he has in store

00:26:45.287 --> 00:26:48.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all who come to visit
that is so important.

00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Patterson Visitors’ Center is designed

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be an immersive
theocratic experience for everyone.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Patterson Visitors’ Center

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:14.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
will feature three museums
and a coin display.

00:27:15.784 --> 00:27:19.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our feature museum
will be a first-century Bible village.

00:27:25.226 --> 00:27:28.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
The objective is to educate visitors 

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what life was like in the first century

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby bring Bible accounts to life.

00:27:35.704 --> 00:27:38.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will get a sense of what things were like

00:27:38.206 --> 00:27:40.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus walked the earth.

00:27:41.376 --> 00:27:44.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the Israelites lived off the land,

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:46.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience begins

00:27:46.114 --> 00:27:49.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an overview of the annual crop cycles

00:27:49.517 --> 00:27:53.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
that formed the core
of so much of their daily activities.

00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:57.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Key agricultural tasks, such as threshing,

00:27:57.692 --> 00:27:59.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
winnowing, and grinding grain,

00:27:59.694 --> 00:28:01.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be illustrated

00:28:01.563 --> 00:28:03.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
with interactive displays.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know you will find the exhibit components,

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the functioning
olive press and wine press,

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:14.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
very interesting and informative.

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next stop will be
a typical first-century market.

00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:36.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you will see some of the food and goods

00:28:36.297 --> 00:28:38.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would have been available

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
depending on the season of the year.

00:28:42.003 --> 00:28:45.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
We next invite you
into the residence and workshop spaces

00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:48.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a typical first-century Israelite family.

00:28:49.611 --> 00:28:51.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
The manger,

00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:54.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
carpentry shop,

00:28:54.749 --> 00:28:57.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
weaving and fabric dying displays

00:28:57.852 --> 00:29:01.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
will illustrate
a number of Israelite activities.

00:29:01.689 --> 00:29:03.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
The residence courtyard area

00:29:03.591 --> 00:29:06.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
will show other regular home tasks

00:29:06.294 --> 00:29:09.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
like grain grinding and basket making.

00:29:10.398 --> 00:29:12.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
We next invite you

00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:14.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a typical Israelite home

00:29:14.402 --> 00:29:16.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and out onto a rooftop

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
overlooking the rest of the village.

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you leave the residences,

00:29:23.411 --> 00:29:25.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will also see an upper room

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would have been
in some of the Israelite homes.

00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:34.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next area
of the first-century Bible village

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:37.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can explore is the synagogue,

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:44.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was the center of worship and study
in the Jewish community.

00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:48.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, a functioning pottery wheel and kiln

00:29:48.436 --> 00:29:51.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
will illustrate how pottery was made.

00:29:51.773 --> 00:29:54.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last stop will take you to a lakeside

00:29:54.809 --> 00:29:58.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you will be able
to board a first-century fishing boat

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
similar to the one
that Jesus and his disciples used.

00:30:03.151 --> 00:30:07.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you can learn what was involved
in commercial fishing.

00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:26.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
This and so much more

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
is waiting for you

00:30:27.842 --> 00:30:31.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the new Patterson Visitors’ Center.

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:34.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t wait for you to come and see

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:38.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
the beautiful spiritual gift
that is waiting for you!

00:30:47.195 --> 00:30:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new visitors’ center and museum 
are on course to be completed

00:30:50.899 --> 00:30:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the fall of 2023.

00:30:53.735 --> 00:30:57.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will guests be able to come back
to Bethel and tour the new facility?

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are going to have to wait and see.

00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:03.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one thing is for sure:

00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:05.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the doors finally do open,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
anyone who makes the effort to come

00:31:07.715 --> 00:31:11.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive a spiritual gift from Jehovah.

00:31:11.419 --> 00:31:15.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
The touring experience
will prove to be a spiritual encouragement

00:31:15.223 --> 00:31:17.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:19.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and promote pure worship

00:31:19.427 --> 00:31:23.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s praise and honor
in a very unique way.

00:31:23.565 --> 00:31:27.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will certainly be a must-see.

00:31:27.268 --> 00:31:29.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve seen
the blessings on this project

00:31:29.437 --> 00:31:31.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, really, all the people
working hard on it.

00:31:32.574 --> 00:31:35.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
The facility is going to benefit
thousands of future visitors.

00:31:37.478 --> 00:31:39.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because all of us,

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
either now or in the new world,

00:31:41.516 --> 00:31:44.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to be taught
about the life and ministry of Jesus.

00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:46.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason, we’re convinced

00:31:46.521 --> 00:31:48.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s blessing on the project

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his desire to have this facility built.

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:54.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jehovah’s desire
that people come to his house

00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:57.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be refreshed and educated.

00:31:57.799 --> 00:32:02.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our prayer
that this new and thrilling visitors’ center

00:32:02.403 --> 00:32:04.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
will accomplish that.

00:32:04.238 --> 00:32:07.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guests will come, they will be upbuilt,

00:32:07.442 --> 00:32:11.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will draw closer to Jehovah God.

00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:24.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure we can hardly wait
to go through that new visitors’ center.

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:26.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I can hardly wait.

00:32:26.894 --> 00:32:30.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to enjoy
two talks on very encouraging themes.

00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:33.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is by Brother Kenneth Cook.

00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:38.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
His subject is
“The Earth That Will Endure Forever.”

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:39.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Cook, please.

00:32:41.175 --> 00:32:44.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Revelation presented
to the apostle John,

00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:47.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus pointed ahead many centuries

00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:49.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the time when Jehovah brings an end

00:32:49.283 --> 00:32:51.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who oppose his Kingdom.

00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:54.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 11:18,

00:32:54.255 --> 00:32:56.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
it speaks of such opposers

00:32:56.257 --> 00:32:59.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “those ruining the earth.”

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
In its entirety, the verse says this

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:06.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Revelation 11:18:

00:33:06.634 --> 00:33:08.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the nations became wrathful,

00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:10.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your own wrath came,

00:33:10.972 --> 00:33:14.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the appointed time came
for the dead to be judged

00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:18.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to reward your slaves the prophets
and the holy ones

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those fearing your name,
the small and the great,

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:24.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to bring to ruin

00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:28.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
those ruining the earth.”

00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:30.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
This verse assures us

00:33:30.525 --> 00:33:33.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is going to stop

00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:35.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ruining of the earth.

00:33:35.797 --> 00:33:39.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it only man’s pollution of the earth

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:43.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the misuse of its resources
that is being spoken of here?

00:33:43.504 --> 00:33:46.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is there more to it?

00:33:46.374 --> 00:33:48.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer those questions,

00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:52.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
here are four main points
that we will consider:

00:33:52.647 --> 00:33:56.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the earth”
as spoken of in God’s Word?

00:33:56.284 --> 00:34:01.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what “ruining” of it
does Revelation 11:18 refer?

00:34:01.255 --> 00:34:04.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will Jehovah act to stop it?

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:09.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the earth
that will endure forever?

00:34:09.497 --> 00:34:13.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, to start, what is meant by “earth”?

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:14.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer that question,

00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:16.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll look at the planet

00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:18.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the people.

00:34:18.206 --> 00:34:20.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we include the people?

00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:23.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because “earth,” like some other expressions

00:34:23.344 --> 00:34:24.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s Word,

00:34:24.579 --> 00:34:27.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
has more than one basic meaning.

00:34:27.515 --> 00:34:29.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the word “heaven.”

00:34:29.884 --> 00:34:32.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Heaven” has the sense
of that which is high, or lofty,

00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:35.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can refer to a number of things.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, at Genesis 27:28,

00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:42.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read of Isaac’s blessing for Jacob.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told him in part:

00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:49.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the true God give you
the dews of the heavens.”

00:34:49.637 --> 00:34:51.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The dews of the heavens”

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:56.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
—here “heavens” has
the meaning of “literal sky,” true?

00:34:56.277 --> 00:35:00.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now compare Daniel 4:26.

00:35:00.581 --> 00:35:04.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this verse, we read
that Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s dream

00:35:04.786 --> 00:35:08.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the great tree, and he says to him:

00:35:08.489 --> 00:35:10.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your kingdom will be yours again

00:35:10.992 --> 00:35:14.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after you come to know that the heavens

00:35:14.462 --> 00:35:16.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ruling.”

00:35:16.564 --> 00:35:20.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, this is not the literal sky, is it?

00:35:20.735 --> 00:35:24.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it has reference
to Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, in the Bible,

00:35:26.941 --> 00:35:30.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “earth”
can have more than one meaning.

00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:34.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s look at the planet.

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:39.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the planets
that have been named after false gods,

00:35:39.187 --> 00:35:41.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis chapter 1 tells us

00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:44.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah named this planet “Earth.”

00:35:44.692 --> 00:35:47.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the false labeling
of the other planets,

00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:51.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be certain that those disgusting names
will soon be gone.

00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:54.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as for the earth, Jehovah leaves us

00:35:54.101 --> 00:35:56.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
in no doubt about its future.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was created to last forever.

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:03.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 1:4 states

00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:08.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
that although generations of people
at this time come and go,

00:36:08.316 --> 00:36:10.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the earth,” it says
—that is, the planet—

00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:13.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remains forever.”

00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:18.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 104:5 adds
that “it will not be moved from its place

00:36:18.059 --> 00:36:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
forever and ever.”

00:36:20.995 --> 00:36:24.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, the planet Earth
will never be destroyed.

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:27.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s purpose for it will be fulfilled.

00:36:27.401 --> 00:36:30.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that purpose?

00:36:30.538 --> 00:36:33.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s purpose
is for the earth to be inhabited

00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:38.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
by faithful humans
in perfection and happiness

00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:41.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
with everlasting life.

00:36:41.883 --> 00:36:46.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to the people,
those for whom the earth was made.

00:36:46.554 --> 00:36:50.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can hardly mention one
without the other, right?

00:36:50.091 --> 00:36:53.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, many scriptures refer to people

00:36:53.327 --> 00:36:55.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
when speaking of the earth.

00:36:55.563 --> 00:36:57.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are some examples.

00:36:57.565 --> 00:37:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 11:1 says: “Now all the earth

00:37:01.269 --> 00:37:04.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued to be of one language.”

00:37:04.238 --> 00:37:06.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Genesis 24:3,

00:37:06.874 --> 00:37:09.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham refers to Jehovah as being

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God of the earth,” obviously people.

00:37:14.048 --> 00:37:16.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 49:13 says:

00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:21.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shout for joy, you heavens,
and rejoice, you earth.”

00:37:21.222 --> 00:37:24.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Revelation 19:2 speaks of false religion

00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the great prostitute corrupted the earth

00:37:28.195 --> 00:37:30.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
with her sexual immorality.”

00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:35.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, those verses refer to humans
who can speak,

00:37:35.102 --> 00:37:38.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can worship, who can express joy,

00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:41.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who can be corrupted
by sexual immorality.

00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:47.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up to this point,
we’ve looked at the earth then as a planet,

00:37:47.915 --> 00:37:50.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have reviewed God’s purpose for it,

00:37:50.418 --> 00:37:53.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have considered how the word “earth”

00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
relates to the people on it.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider the question,

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:03.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what “ruining”
does Revelation 11:18 refer?

00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:05.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the planet?

00:38:05.232 --> 00:38:06.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people?

00:38:06.467 --> 00:38:08.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or both?

00:38:08.102 --> 00:38:10.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the planet:

00:38:10.104 --> 00:38:14.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hates to see the earth
being ruined today as it is.

00:38:14.508 --> 00:38:17.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be certain
that he hates the pollution,

00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:19.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
the damage to the earth’s climate,

00:38:19.747 --> 00:38:22.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
the misuse of its resources,

00:38:22.149 --> 00:38:25.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the devastation of human wars.

00:38:25.953 --> 00:38:28.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cares for what he has made.

00:38:28.689 --> 00:38:31.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
After making the earth,
he said “that it was good.”

00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:36.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can read about it
in Genesis chapters 1 and 2.

00:38:36.097 --> 00:38:38.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine Jehovah’s happiness!

00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:42.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
This special planet was to be a gift.

00:38:42.636 --> 00:38:45.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 115:16 states

00:38:45.306 --> 00:38:49.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the earth he has given
to the sons of men.”

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what about the people?

00:38:53.114 --> 00:38:57.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah’s disgust
at the ruining of the earth apply

00:38:57.218 --> 00:39:00.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the ruining of mankind as well?

00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:01.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:39:01.522 --> 00:39:03.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see this from what is stated

00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Genesis 6:11, 12.

00:39:07.995 --> 00:39:11.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this setting, the world of Noah’s day

00:39:11.399 --> 00:39:14.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
had become ruined in God’s eyes.

00:39:14.535 --> 00:39:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read the verses,

00:39:16.537 --> 00:39:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for the connection
between the earth and mankind.

00:39:21.542 --> 00:39:25.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says at Genesis chapter 6,
starting in verse 11:

00:39:27.114 --> 00:39:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the earth had become ruined
in the sight of the true God,

00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:33.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the earth was filled with violence.

00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:37.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, God looked upon the earth,
and it was ruined;

00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:41.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”

00:39:43.397 --> 00:39:45.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see the connection?

00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:48.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than speaking of just the planet,

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:52.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scriptures here link
the ruining of “all flesh,” or people,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the ruining of the earth.

00:39:56.177 --> 00:40:00.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise today, just as mankind
is harming the actual planet,

00:40:00.915 --> 00:40:03.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
the world under Satan’s control

00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:06.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
is also ruining all flesh.

00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:10.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
In both ways, the earth is being ruined.

00:40:10.024 --> 00:40:11.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:14.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with false religion,

00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:18.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
human society in general
is gradually corrupting everything

00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:21.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has set in place for mankind.

00:40:21.869 --> 00:40:26.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it
in their incessant nationalistic wars.

00:40:26.407 --> 00:40:30.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it
in their racial hatred and divisiveness.

00:40:30.478 --> 00:40:34.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it in their promoting of abortion.

00:40:34.148 --> 00:40:37.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it in their so-called gay marriage.

00:40:37.551 --> 00:40:42.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see it in the gender blurring
that the world is promoting.

00:40:42.223 --> 00:40:45.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You don’t have to be a man or a woman,”
they say.

00:40:45.226 --> 00:40:48.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You can be whatever you feel like
or choose to be.”

00:40:48.295 --> 00:40:50.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:40:50.097 --> 00:40:53.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah say about that?

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Deuteronomy 22:5,

00:40:56.403 --> 00:40:58.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told the nation of Israel

00:40:58.405 --> 00:41:03.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “a woman must not
put on the clothing of a man,

00:41:03.277 --> 00:41:06.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor should a man wear
the clothing of a woman.

00:41:06.247 --> 00:41:09.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For anyone doing so is detestable

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah your God.”

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is how the Creator feels
about the switching of clothing,

00:41:17.124 --> 00:41:21.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much more detestable
he must view the world’s attempts

00:41:21.128 --> 00:41:25.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
to blur the lines of gender
with false labeling!

00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:28.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, the World Health Organization

00:41:28.769 --> 00:41:31.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
adjusted its view of gender.

00:41:31.305 --> 00:41:34.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
It now states that “there are many genders

00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:39.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
existing on a spectrum from male to female.”

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It added that “gender identity

00:41:42.716 --> 00:41:44.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“exists on a continuum

00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:48.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that sex
is not limited to male or female.”

00:41:48.989 --> 00:41:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, really?

00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:56.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about an attempt to tear apart
what Jehovah has made!

00:41:56.363 --> 00:41:58.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, even government agencies

00:41:58.732 --> 00:42:01.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a global scale are getting involved,

00:42:01.869 --> 00:42:04.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are critical of anyone

00:42:04.138 --> 00:42:07.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
who does not adopt their warped view.

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:11.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Proverbs 19:3, it explains:

00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:15.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is a man’s own foolishness
that distorts his way,

00:42:15.883 --> 00:42:19.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his heart
becomes enraged against Jehovah.”

00:42:20.821 --> 00:42:22.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
And going back to marriage,

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah instituted the arrangement
to be a permanent bond

00:42:26.727 --> 00:42:29.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
between a man and a woman.

00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 19:4, 5,

00:42:32.733 --> 00:42:37.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read how Jesus emphasized this
while he was on the earth.

00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:40.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Quoting from Genesis 2:24, he said this:

00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you not read that the one
who created them from the beginning

00:42:45.412 --> 00:42:49.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“made them male and female and said:

00:42:49.016 --> 00:42:52.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For this reason a man
will leave his father and his mother

00:42:52.686 --> 00:42:55.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and will stick to his wife,

00:42:55.122 --> 00:42:58.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the two will be one flesh’?”

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:02.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “made them male and female . . . ,

00:43:02.596 --> 00:43:06.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the two will be one flesh.”

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose for humans is clear.

00:43:09.703 --> 00:43:12.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Satan’s world now says that marriage

00:43:12.273 --> 00:43:15.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be between two men or two women.

00:43:15.576 --> 00:43:18.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, really?

00:43:18.178 --> 00:43:21.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be certain
that promoting this corrupt view

00:43:21.282 --> 00:43:25.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
is part of Satan’s attempt to ruin mankind

00:43:25.986 --> 00:43:29.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to make them so abhorrent to Jehovah

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:31.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would abandon humans

00:43:31.925 --> 00:43:35.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his purpose for mankind on the earth.

00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that will never happen.

00:43:37.965 --> 00:43:41.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s purpose for mankind and their home

00:43:41.302 --> 00:43:44.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be fulfilled.

00:43:44.505 --> 00:43:47.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like the disgusting names
of the false gods

00:43:47.408 --> 00:43:50.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans have given
to the literal planets,

00:43:50.244 --> 00:43:53.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
the false labeling of humankind

00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:57.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the immorality will not continue.

00:43:57.418 --> 00:44:01.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
For his own name’s sake
and for those who love him,

00:44:01.322 --> 00:44:03.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “bring to ruin

00:44:03.424 --> 00:44:06.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
those ruining the earth.”

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s one thing
to consider Jehovah’s view

00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:11.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
on such matters among ourselves.

00:44:11.865 --> 00:44:14.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are we doing to help other people?

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:18.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we doing to build respect
for Jehovah’s view of the earth,

00:44:18.972 --> 00:44:21.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s view of humankind,

00:44:21.275 --> 00:44:24.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s purpose for their future?

00:44:24.978 --> 00:44:27.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with a clear conscience,
we can confidently say

00:44:27.848 --> 00:44:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve “not held back”
in speaking the truth about such matters.

00:44:32.553 --> 00:44:35.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, here are some of the articles

00:44:35.889 --> 00:44:39.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org that honesthearted ones can read.

00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:44.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
“What Does the Bible Say About Abortion?,”

00:44:44.998 --> 00:44:49.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does the Bible Comment
on Same-Sex Marriages?,”

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:54.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “How Can I Explain the Bible’s View
of Homosexuality?”

00:44:55.876 --> 00:45:00.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be happy to have such tools
to help other people.

00:45:00.848 --> 00:45:03.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what is more important to Jehovah?

00:45:03.484 --> 00:45:07.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
The literal planet or the people?

00:45:07.054 --> 00:45:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both are highly valued,

00:45:09.056 --> 00:45:12.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is why both will endure forever.

00:45:12.893 --> 00:45:14.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the people of the earth

00:45:14.895 --> 00:45:18.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
are far more important.

00:45:18.432 --> 00:45:21.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave his Son as a ransom for mankind,

00:45:21.602 --> 00:45:23.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
not for a planet.

00:45:23.871 --> 00:45:27.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 3:16 says
that “God loved the world so much

00:45:27.374 --> 00:45:29.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that he gave his only-begotten Son,

00:45:29.877 --> 00:45:33.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that every one exercising faith in him

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“might not be destroyed

00:45:36.784 --> 00:45:39.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have everlasting life.”

00:45:40.788 --> 00:45:43.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of Jesus, God’s “master worker,”

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:47.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 8:31 quotes him as saying:

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:50.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I rejoiced over his habitable earth,

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was especially fond
of the sons of men.”

00:45:56.236 --> 00:46:00.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing this, what should we continue to do?

00:46:00.274 --> 00:46:03.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we should kindly and respectfully

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
help others to see Jehovah’s view

00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:08.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
while there is still time.

00:46:08.482 --> 00:46:11.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must never
become “ashamed of the good news,”

00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:14.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it’s not just good news about Paradise.

00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:17.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also good news about Jehovah’s time

00:46:17.157 --> 00:46:20.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set things right on earth again.

00:46:20.594 --> 00:46:24.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents with young children
should take courage

00:46:24.097 --> 00:46:28.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this fact as they work hard
to protect their children

00:46:28.035 --> 00:46:32.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Satan’s attempts
to ruin their minds and hearts

00:46:32.072 --> 00:46:35.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
with immoral thoughts and false reasoning.

00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:40.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, the end is coming quickly.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice what is said
at Revelation chapter 14

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 6 and 7.

00:46:46.687 --> 00:46:48.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read it,

00:46:48.856 --> 00:46:51.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for what an angel includes

00:46:51.124 --> 00:46:53.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the good news that he declares.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says, in part—

00:46:55.762 --> 00:46:58.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation chapter 14,

00:46:58.465 --> 00:47:03.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 6 and 7 says:

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:08.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He had everlasting good news to declare
to those who dwell on the earth,

00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:12.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.

00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:14.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was saying in a loud voice:

00:47:14.715 --> 00:47:17.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Fear God and give him glory,

00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:21.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because the hour of judgment
by him has arrived,

00:47:21.221 --> 00:47:24.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so worship the One
who made the heaven and the earth

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:29.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sea and the springs of water.’”

00:47:29.863 --> 00:47:34.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what does the angel
include in his message,

00:47:34.568 --> 00:47:38.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his good news that he is declaring?

00:47:38.305 --> 00:47:41.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fear God,” he said, “and give him glory,

00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:45.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the hour of judgment
by him has arrived.”

00:47:45.512 --> 00:47:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who love what is right,

00:47:47.581 --> 00:47:51.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is truly good news.

00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:55.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy to include
this angelic message

00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:58.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we share with other people.

00:47:58.492 --> 00:48:00.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word assures us

00:48:00.494 --> 00:48:04.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 17:31

00:48:04.865 --> 00:48:09.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah “has set a day
on which he purposes to judge

00:48:09.169 --> 00:48:13.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inhabited earth in righteousness”
by means of his Son.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a relief and peace

00:48:16.543 --> 00:48:20.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will bring to those
who want to please Jehovah!

00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:24.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this talk,
we have examined what is meant

00:48:24.785 --> 00:48:26.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Bible speaks of “the earth,”

00:48:26.853 --> 00:48:30.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, the planet and the people

00:48:30.123 --> 00:48:32.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
for whom it was made.

00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:35.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have also considered the fact
that the earth

00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:40.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being ruined in more ways
than just the corrupting of its environment

00:48:40.367 --> 00:48:42.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the misuse of its resources.

00:48:42.836 --> 00:48:45.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
It goes far beyond that, doesn’t it?

00:48:45.672 --> 00:48:48.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan and his world are also attempting

00:48:48.942 --> 00:48:51.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ruin Jehovah’s human creation

00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:54.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
in every way possible,

00:48:54.047 --> 00:48:56.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they will fail.

00:48:56.149 --> 00:49:00.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jehovah gave his Son
to save faithful humans

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to restore his purpose,

00:49:03.123 --> 00:49:07.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
our next question is, When will it happen?

00:49:07.427 --> 00:49:09.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will Jehovah bring to ruin

00:49:09.896 --> 00:49:12.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
those ruining the earth?

00:49:12.466 --> 00:49:16.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer to that question is soon,
very soon.

00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ruining of mankind in their home

00:49:18.438 --> 00:49:21.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be allowed to go on.

00:49:21.508 --> 00:49:23.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let no one be mistaken about it.

00:49:23.777 --> 00:49:25.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is resolved.

00:49:25.812 --> 00:49:27.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is patient . . .

00:49:27.814 --> 00:49:30.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not desire anyone to be destroyed.”

00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:34.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he is determined; his “day is coming.”

00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:38.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 3:13 assures us

00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:41.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “there are new heavens and a new earth

00:49:41.328 --> 00:49:45.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are awaiting
according to his promise.”

00:49:45.632 --> 00:49:49.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
That promised “new earth”
is a new human society

00:49:49.269 --> 00:49:53.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will worship and serve
the only true God forever.

00:49:54.608 --> 00:49:57.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who persist in ruining the earth

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be a part of it.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 19:28,

00:50:02.449 --> 00:50:05.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus speaks of this coming change

00:50:05.819 --> 00:50:09.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a time of “re-creation.”

00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:12.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note for that verse
says that re-creation

00:50:12.959 --> 00:50:16.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “regeneration; [or] renewal.”

00:50:16.897 --> 00:50:19.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
It then adds that the re-creation is

00:50:19.966 --> 00:50:23.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the time when the rule of Christ
and his corulers

00:50:23.704 --> 00:50:27.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will bring to the earth
a renewal of the perfect conditions

00:50:27.974 --> 00:50:32.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyed by the first humans
before they sinned.”

00:50:32.345 --> 00:50:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful to think about!

00:50:35.916 --> 00:50:40.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
The re-creation will set things straight
after a failed rebellion.

00:50:40.787 --> 00:50:45.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will fulfill Jehovah’s purpose
for the earth.

00:50:45.092 --> 00:50:49.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what is “the earth”
that is being ruined today?

00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:51.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have discussed,

00:50:51.565 --> 00:50:53.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is the planet

00:50:53.233 --> 00:50:55.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the people being corrupted

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:57.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Satan’s world.

00:50:57.471 --> 00:50:58.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is “the earth”

00:50:58.939 --> 00:51:01.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will endure forever?

00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:04.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the planet.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have read, the Scriptures are clear

00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:08.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it will last forever.

00:51:08.715 --> 00:51:10.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, and most important,

00:51:10.584 --> 00:51:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people are “the new earth,”

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
those for whom Jesus died

00:51:15.355 --> 00:51:18.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who respond to the good news.

00:51:18.358 --> 00:51:20.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
The re-creation is coming.

00:51:20.794 --> 00:51:25.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will not waste
a single day of the thousand years,

00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:28.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
not one day of it.

00:51:29.503 --> 00:51:31.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s determined to honor Jehovah

00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:34.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accomplish His purpose for the earth.

00:51:36.743 --> 00:51:39.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
The future is not complicated.

00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:43.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose is not hard to understand.

00:51:43.383 --> 00:51:48.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
The coming time of re-creation
will bring about a rejuvenated earth,

00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:51.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
a rejuvenated planet,
filled with perfect people

00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:55.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
who love and serve Jehovah together.

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:59.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the earth that will endure forever.

00:52:05.272 --> 00:52:08.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciated that encouragement very much.

00:52:08.508 --> 00:52:10.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Ken.

00:52:10.177 --> 00:52:12.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on another positive note,

00:52:12.179 --> 00:52:16.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s listen as our brother,
Mark Sanderson, speaks to us on the subject

00:52:16.116 --> 00:52:19.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Share It With the Generation to Come.”

00:52:19.586 --> 00:52:21.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark, please.

00:52:22.689 --> 00:52:26.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 13:52,

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:29.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that “every public instructor”

00:52:29.429 --> 00:52:32.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
was like a man with a “treasure store”

00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:37.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
filled with truths, old and new.

00:52:37.003 --> 00:52:38.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that’s true.

00:52:38.705 --> 00:52:42.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if it’s true,
it means that this audience

00:52:42.943 --> 00:52:47.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
is among the most rich people
in the entire world.

00:52:47.113 --> 00:52:50.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have a large ‘treasure store

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:54.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
of truths both old and new.’

00:52:55.055 --> 00:52:57.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the question,

00:52:57.324 --> 00:53:01.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do with your treasure store?

00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:07.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at Deuteronomy 29:29,

00:53:09.636 --> 00:53:12.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses gave these words;

00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:16.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “The things concealed
belong to Jehovah our God,

00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:21.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the things revealed belong to us

00:53:21.615 --> 00:53:24.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and [and]

00:53:24.851 --> 00:53:27.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to our descendants forever,

00:53:27.988 --> 00:53:31.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may carry out all the words

00:53:31.524 --> 00:53:33.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this Law.”

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s a fundamental truth there.

00:53:36.029 --> 00:53:40.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the truth
never solely belongs to us.

00:53:40.433 --> 00:53:45.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather,
it also belongs to our descendants

00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:49.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to all of our sons and daughters
who are to come.

00:53:49.509 --> 00:53:53.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that means
that as men and women of faith,

00:53:53.713 --> 00:53:57.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a clear responsibility

00:53:57.350 --> 00:54:00.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share
(to pass on)

00:54:00.287 --> 00:54:03.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wonderful truths
that we have come to know

00:54:03.223 --> 00:54:05.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the next generation.

00:54:05.225 --> 00:54:07.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible emphasizes this.

00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:10.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read what the psalmist said

00:54:10.096 --> 00:54:13.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 78:3.

00:54:15.402 --> 00:54:19.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 78:3 says:

00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:22.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The things we have heard and know,

00:54:22.208 --> 00:54:25.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which our fathers have related to us,

00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:29.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will not hide from their sons;

00:54:29.149 --> 00:54:32.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will relate to the generation to come

00:54:32.585 --> 00:54:37.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah
and his strength,

00:54:37.057 --> 00:54:41.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wonderful things he has done.”

00:54:41.828 --> 00:54:44.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now this includes

00:54:44.264 --> 00:54:47.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than just the basic truths.

00:54:47.934 --> 00:54:51.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also includes all of the wonderful things

00:54:51.338 --> 00:54:55.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve been taught
by other brothers and sisters,

00:54:55.842 --> 00:54:58.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the experiences that we’ve had,

00:54:58.812 --> 00:55:03.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experiencing
the hand of Jehovah in our own lives.

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:07.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah took the matter
of passing this on

00:55:07.487 --> 00:55:10.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the next generation very seriously,

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:14.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
because look at what it says in verse 5.

00:55:14.194 --> 00:55:18.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “He established a reminder in Jacob

00:55:18.198 --> 00:55:20.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and set a law in Israel;

00:55:20.934 --> 00:55:23.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He commanded our forefathers

00:55:23.436 --> 00:55:26.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make these things
known to their children,

00:55:26.873 --> 00:55:29.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the next generation,

00:55:29.042 --> 00:55:32.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the children yet to be born,
might know them.

00:55:32.979 --> 00:55:37.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
They in turn
would relate them to their children.”

00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:40.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,

00:55:40.086 --> 00:55:44.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those of you
who have so much wisdom and experience,

00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:49.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you feel that responsibility to share

00:55:49.362 --> 00:55:52.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you have with the generations to come?

00:55:52.866 --> 00:55:54.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we get the sense

00:55:54.868 --> 00:55:59.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Deuteronomy 29:29
and Psalm 78,

00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:01.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
well then, we will do this.

00:56:01.107 --> 00:56:04.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will share what we have
with the next generation.

00:56:04.844 --> 00:56:07.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do we do it?

00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:11.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, this process begins
with all of our parents,

00:56:11.684 --> 00:56:14.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
by their following the command

00:56:14.754 --> 00:56:17.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Deuteronomy 6:6, 7

00:56:17.991 --> 00:56:21.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach their children
as ‘they sit in the house,

00:56:21.227 --> 00:56:26.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they walk on the road,
when they lie down, and when they get up.’

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:32.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the process does not end
with the Christian parents.

00:56:32.205 --> 00:56:35.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have a responsibility

00:56:35.408 --> 00:56:39.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach and train young adults

00:56:39.546 --> 00:56:42.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can take on responsibility

00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:45.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s congregation.

00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:49.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Bible is filled
with examples of individuals

00:56:49.122 --> 00:56:51.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are wonderful trainers.

00:56:51.124 --> 00:56:55.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe one who comes to mind
right away is Moses.

00:56:55.095 --> 00:56:59.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems that in the Bible,
whenever you see Moses, you see Joshua.

00:56:59.199 --> 00:57:01.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re always together.

00:57:01.468 --> 00:57:04.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the wonderful training

00:57:04.204 --> 00:57:07.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Moses was able to impart to Joshua

00:57:07.407 --> 00:57:11.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they worked together
for more than 40 years?

00:57:11.945 --> 00:57:15.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses not only told Joshua

00:57:15.548 --> 00:57:17.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also he showed him.

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:22.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by being with him,
he was able to observe his fine example.

00:57:22.255 --> 00:57:25.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when the time was ready,

00:57:25.191 --> 00:57:29.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Moses was ready
to hand over the responsibility,

00:57:29.162 --> 00:57:33.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what he says here
at Deuteronomy chapter 31

00:57:35.068 --> 00:57:37.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 7.

00:57:37.504 --> 00:57:40.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Moses then called Joshua

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to him
before the eyes of all Israel:

00:57:43.877 --> 00:57:47.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘Be courageous and strong,

00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:49.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘for you are the one
who will bring this people

00:57:49.516 --> 00:57:53.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘into the land that Jehovah
swore to their forefathers to give to them,

00:57:53.853 --> 00:57:57.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘and you will give it to them
as an inheritance.

00:57:57.323 --> 00:58:00.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘Jehovah is the one marching before you,

00:58:00.126 --> 00:58:02.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘and he will continue with you.

00:58:02.228 --> 00:58:05.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘He will neither desert you
nor abandon you.

00:58:05.465 --> 00:58:09.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be afraid or be terrified.’”

00:58:09.169 --> 00:58:13.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, can you imagine
how Moses must have felt

00:58:13.773 --> 00:58:16.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say those words to this young man

00:58:16.142 --> 00:58:20.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom he had worked so hard
all of these years with?

00:58:21.147 --> 00:58:24.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s not the only example
that is in the Scriptures.

00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:27.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Paul and Timothy?

00:58:27.187 --> 00:58:31.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Timothy
was probably in his late teens or early 20’s

00:58:31.724 --> 00:58:33.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul met him at Lystra.

00:58:33.726 --> 00:58:35.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul do?

00:58:35.495 --> 00:58:39.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took that young man
along with him on his tours,

00:58:39.632 --> 00:58:42.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
going from congregation to congregation.

00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:45.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
He put him in the mind of his methods.

00:58:45.638 --> 00:58:47.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
He taught him.

00:58:47.373 --> 00:58:50.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result, Timothy came to be

00:58:50.176 --> 00:58:53.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
a solid, mature Christian man

00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:57.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was able to strengthen
the congregations of God’s people.

00:58:57.483 --> 00:58:59.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what Paul said about him

00:58:59.919 --> 00:59:02.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Philippians chapter 2?

00:59:02.288 --> 00:59:04.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s quite a recommendation.

00:59:04.824 --> 00:59:09.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 2:20,

00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:11.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul said:

00:59:11.097 --> 00:59:15.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I have no one else
of a disposition like his

00:59:15.868 --> 00:59:20.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will genuinely care for your concerns.”

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:23.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tremendous recommendation!

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:27.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because Paul had invested
that time into Timothy,

00:59:27.347 --> 00:59:31.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knew the fine qualities
that young man had.

00:59:31.618 --> 00:59:35.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Paul not only wanted Timothy

00:59:35.054 --> 00:59:37.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take that training himself

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:41.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’ll recall that in 2 Timothy chapter 2

00:59:41.761 --> 00:59:45.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gave advice to Timothy
as to what he was to do

00:59:45.898 --> 00:59:49.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all of that fine training
that he had received.

00:59:49.302 --> 00:59:54.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Timothy 2:2, Paul said:

00:59:54.307 --> 00:59:56.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the things you heard from me

00:59:56.843 --> 01:00:00.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that were supported by many witnesses,

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:04.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“these things entrust to faithful men,

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:08.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who, in turn, will be adequately qualified

01:00:08.655 --> 01:00:10.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach others.”

01:00:10.256 --> 01:00:14.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that training
would go on to future brothers

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:18.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future generations
of servants of Jehovah.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:22.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul invested training in a very young man,

01:00:22.135 --> 01:00:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it paid off.

01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:26.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our modern day,

01:00:26.906 --> 01:00:29.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think of Brother Nathan Knorr

01:00:29.442 --> 01:00:32.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an outstanding trainer.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:35.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he became the president
of the Watch Tower Society

01:00:35.415 --> 01:00:38.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
in January of 1942,

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:41.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was only 36 years old.

01:00:41.821 --> 01:00:44.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now he could have thought: ‘I’m so young.

01:00:44.357 --> 01:00:46.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have a huge—

01:00:46.025 --> 01:00:50.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have many, many years ahead of me
to be able to care for matters.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so there really isn’t
any need to train others.’

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:57.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Brother Knorr
did not have that disposition.

01:00:57.704 --> 01:01:01.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a trainer even at that young age.

01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:04.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
He assigned Brother Milton Henschel,

01:01:04.777 --> 01:01:07.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was in his mid-20’s,

01:01:07.513 --> 01:01:09.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be his secretary.

01:01:09.982 --> 01:01:12.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr took Brother Henschel with him

01:01:12.352 --> 01:01:15.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his travels all over the world

01:01:15.121 --> 01:01:19.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
to branches and missionary homes
to strengthen the brothers.

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:23.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had him right by his side
at major conventions,

01:01:23.996 --> 01:01:25.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just telling him

01:01:25.998 --> 01:01:29.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
but showing him how to take the lead.

01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:33.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Henschel absorbed that training.

01:01:33.539 --> 01:01:38.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1947, he was a member
of the board of directors

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:41.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Society
at only 27 years old.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:46.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he went on to serve
as a member of the Governing Body.

01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:50.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr trained
other young brothers like Don Adams.

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:54.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
This photo that we’re about to show 

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:59.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
was taken at a gathering
on Brother Adams’ 70th anniversary

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
in full-time service.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:05.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here you see
another group of young men

01:02:05.438 --> 01:02:10.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Brother Knorr had trained
—Robert Wallen, Charles Molohan,

01:02:10.209 --> 01:02:13.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
David Sinclair, and Don Adams.

01:02:13.846 --> 01:02:17.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these men were identified
when they were very young,

01:02:17.784 --> 01:02:21.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they worked together
for more than 50 years faithfully.

01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:25.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helped Brother Knorr

01:02:25.224 --> 01:02:27.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
to choose very well.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it didn’t end there.

01:02:29.796 --> 01:02:33.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr also appointed
well-qualified young brothers

01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:38.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were Gilead graduates
to assignments with great responsibility.

01:02:38.471 --> 01:02:40.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

01:02:40.139 --> 01:02:44.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Little was assigned
to be the branch servant in Canada

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was 34 years old.

01:02:48.614 --> 01:02:50.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Denton Hopkinson

01:02:50.082 --> 01:02:53.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
was assigned as the branch servant
in the Philippines

01:02:53.052 --> 01:02:55.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was 33 years old,

01:02:56.923 --> 01:02:58.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Brother Richard Kelsey

01:02:58.424 --> 01:03:01.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
was assigned
as the branch servant in Germany

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:03.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was 38.

01:03:03.963 --> 01:03:08.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
When appointed, Brother Kelsey
said to Brother Knorr, “But I’m only 38.”

01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:10.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Knorr said,

01:03:10.837 --> 01:03:13.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, yeah, that’s about the age I was
when I became president.”

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:19.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr once again had chosen well.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:23.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those last three brothers
are all still serving

01:03:23.082 --> 01:03:27.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the branch committees
in their respective lands and are all members

01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:31.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible
and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

01:03:31.157 --> 01:03:33.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are tied in today for this meeting.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

01:03:49.342 --> 01:03:51.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a lesson here, brothers.

01:03:51.377 --> 01:03:53.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a lesson:

01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:58.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr expressed confidence
in humble young brothers.

01:03:58.284 --> 01:04:02.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed them to take on responsibility,

01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:05.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that proved to be a wonderful blessing

01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:08.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s people.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the lesson, then, for elders,

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
for circuit overseers,
for branch committee members

01:04:14.734 --> 01:04:19.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
—really, for all mature brothers
in the congregation?

01:04:19.972 --> 01:04:24.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must actively be training and teaching

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:27.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next generation of ministerial servants,

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:29.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next generation of elders,

01:04:29.982 --> 01:04:33.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next generation of circuit overseers.

01:04:33.085 --> 01:04:37.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we must take
this responsibility seriously

01:04:37.223 --> 01:04:41.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the truth belongs not just to us.

01:04:41.827 --> 01:04:46.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also belongs to our sons,
to our descendants.

01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:50.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must pass on the truth, the wisdom,

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience that we have
in our treasure store

01:04:55.107 --> 01:04:59.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
to these next “Joshuas,”
these next “Timothys”

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:02.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will raise up.

01:05:02.248 --> 01:05:04.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, that’s the role of the trainers.

01:05:04.884 --> 01:05:08.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the role of you younger brothers

01:05:08.521 --> 01:05:10.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are listening to this program?

01:05:10.723 --> 01:05:14.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s your responsibility to work hard

01:05:14.393 --> 01:05:16.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the Scriptural qualifications

01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:21.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ministerial servants
and later for elders.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seek out training.

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:27.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask for advice.
Ask for counsel.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be eager to learn from older brothers

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:35.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are rich in wisdom and experience.

01:05:35.047 --> 01:05:39.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to help you grow,
those brothers may give you some counsel.

01:05:39.885 --> 01:05:43.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may even correct you from time to time.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:47.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you love them for doing that?

01:05:47.293 --> 01:05:52.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jacob, who wrestled with an angel
to receive a blessing,

01:05:52.098 --> 01:05:54.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
you too may have to wrestle.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may have to struggle at times

01:05:56.569 --> 01:06:01.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get that blessing, to reach that goal.

01:06:01.073 --> 01:06:05.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you work hard
and if you look to Jehovah for his help,

01:06:05.978 --> 01:06:08.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will grow spiritually.

01:06:08.481 --> 01:06:10.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will draw close to him.

01:06:10.082 --> 01:06:15.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who knows
what responsibilities may come to you?

01:06:15.087 --> 01:06:20.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the Governing Body doing
to support efforts to train young brothers?

01:06:20.092 --> 01:06:22.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in January of this year,

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body requested

01:06:24.296 --> 01:06:27.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
all bodies of elders worldwide

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:30.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give priority
to helping younger brothers

01:06:30.803 --> 01:06:33.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow in their relationship
with Jehovah

01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:38.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to qualify
for congregation responsibilities.

01:06:38.044 --> 01:06:41.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders and circuit overseers
were reminded

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
that young brothers
who apply themselves

01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:47.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
may qualify as ministerial servants

01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:49.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their late teens 

01:06:49.822 --> 01:06:53.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that an exceptional ministerial servant

01:06:53.025 --> 01:06:57.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has gained experience
in shepherding and teaching

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:01.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
could serve as an elder in his early 20’s.

01:07:02.868 --> 01:07:05.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another arrangement

01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:08.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have not publicly announced before,

01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:10.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we will today.

01:07:10.843 --> 01:07:14.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Circuit overseers have also been informed

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they may invite qualified young brothers

01:07:17.149 --> 01:07:21.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the ages of 21 and 23

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:07:26.525 --> 01:07:31.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please don’t all call
your circuit overseer at once.

01:07:31.197 --> 01:07:34.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the efforts do not end there.

01:07:34.867 --> 01:07:38.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah willing, in January 2023,

01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:40.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:43.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
will again begin functioning

01:07:43.175 --> 01:07:46.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
in person worldwide.

01:07:46.378 --> 01:07:51.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we resume
in-person regional conventions,

01:07:51.383 --> 01:07:54.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
just imagine the joy that we’ll have

01:07:54.553 --> 01:07:57.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeing younger brothers get up

01:07:57.923 --> 01:08:01.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give their first talk
at a regional convention.

01:08:01.761 --> 01:08:04.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Won’t that be wonderful?
Are you looking forward to it?

01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:19.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Governing Body
has another new initiative.

01:08:19.545 --> 01:08:22.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Governing Body members
will now have the possibility

01:08:22.782 --> 01:08:25.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take a younger brother along with them

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:29.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they make
shepherding visits to the branches,

01:08:29.221 --> 01:08:32.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appointed Governing Body helpers

01:08:32.124 --> 01:08:34.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are headquarters representatives

01:08:34.593 --> 01:08:38.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
will also be allowed
to take a younger brother with them

01:08:38.297 --> 01:08:40.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they make their branch visits.

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:44.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
These arrangements will allow many brothers

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:46.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive additional training

01:08:46.272 --> 01:08:50.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
directly from Governing Body members
and helpers.

01:08:51.610 --> 01:08:55.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what have we discussed
in this brief talk?

01:08:55.347 --> 01:08:58.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has allowed us to know the truth.

01:08:58.784 --> 01:09:00.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s allowed us to be trained.

01:09:00.953 --> 01:09:03.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s allowed us
to gain wisdom and experience

01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:07.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other experienced brothers and sisters.

01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:10.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
What now is our responsibility?

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s read it in Psalm 71,

01:09:13.732 --> 01:09:16.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the psalmist put it
so beautifully here

01:09:16.635 --> 01:09:20.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 71:17:

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:25.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O God, you have taught me from my youth,

01:09:25.778 --> 01:09:28.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and until now I keep declaring

01:09:28.781 --> 01:09:31.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your wonderful works.

01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:35.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even when I am old and gray,
O God, do not abandon me.

01:09:35.821 --> 01:09:39.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let me tell the next generation

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:42.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about your power and about your mightiness

01:09:42.962 --> 01:09:46.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all those who are to come.”

01:09:46.665 --> 01:09:50.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers, please let us work hard

01:09:50.936 --> 01:09:53.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the wonderful truths,

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:57.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience, the wisdom
that we have gained

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the generation to come.

01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:08.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
That certainly does meet a need, doesn’t it?

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very, very nice.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:11.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mark.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:15.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did you feel during the pandemic

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:20.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you watched videos on JW Broadcasting

01:10:20.499 --> 01:10:24.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
of happy brothers and sisters
going from door to door

01:10:24.536 --> 01:10:27.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and doing cart work
and conducting Bible studies?

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:33.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me kind of sad
because I wanted to do that too,

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:36.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we couldn’t because of the pandemic.

01:10:36.415 --> 01:10:40.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we have access
to all of our features of the ministry.

01:10:40.853 --> 01:10:45.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I don’t think any of us are going to be
sad when watching the next video.

01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:49.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is going to trace the history
of our preaching activity

01:10:49.428 --> 01:10:51.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 1919.

01:10:51.563 --> 01:10:53.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s great!

01:10:54.867 --> 01:10:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
One hundred years ago,
when our brothers and sisters were invited

01:10:59.038 --> 01:11:02.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the 1922 Cedar Point, Ohio, convention,

01:11:02.574 --> 01:11:05.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were very excited.

01:11:05.244 --> 01:11:07.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:11:07.046 --> 01:11:09.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, just three years earlier,

01:11:09.448 --> 01:11:12.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had been energized
by a newly organized approach

01:11:12.885 --> 01:11:14.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the good news of the Kingdom.

01:11:15.921 --> 01:11:20.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible Students’ convention in 1919
launched a door-to-door campaign

01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:25.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain subscriptions
to the newly released <i>Golden Age</i>  magazine.

01:11:26.598 --> 01:11:29.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later that year,
a Service Director was appointed

01:11:29.301 --> 01:11:31.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each group of Bible Students.

01:11:31.737 --> 01:11:34.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they had clear direction

01:11:34.139 --> 01:11:37.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
in following Jesus’ command to preach.

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:41.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
That convention was considered
by many who were there

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be “the greatest ever held”
up to that time.

01:11:44.249 --> 01:11:46.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
So imagine their anticipation

01:11:46.952 --> 01:11:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the announcement was made
of another convention in 1922!

01:11:51.924 --> 01:11:53.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would it bring?

01:11:53.926 --> 01:11:57.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would there be other exciting announcements?

01:11:57.029 --> 01:11:58.664 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everywhere around the grounds,

01:11:58.664 --> 01:12:00.366 line:10% position:50% align:center
you’d see the big capital letters

01:12:00.366 --> 01:12:03.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
ADV, ADV, ADV.

01:12:03.469 --> 01:12:05.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody thought, ‘What is ADV?’

01:12:05.704 --> 01:12:07.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many were guessing this and guessing that.

01:12:08.374 --> 01:12:11.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Behold, the King reigns!

01:12:12.277 --> 01:12:15.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are his publicity agents.

01:12:17.449 --> 01:12:20.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore advertise,

01:12:20.519 --> 01:12:22.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertise,

01:12:22.554 --> 01:12:26.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertise, the King and his Kingdom.

01:12:31.563 --> 01:12:33.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well there wasn’t a dry eye in the audience.

01:12:33.966 --> 01:12:35.868 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everybody was crying.

01:12:35.868 --> 01:12:37.970 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everybody was waving their handkerchiefs

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:41.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking to whoever was sitting by
whether they knew them or not.

01:12:42.474 --> 01:12:44.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now more than just Bible students,

01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:49.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were becoming
an organization of preachers.

01:12:49.148 --> 01:12:53.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would the call to ‘advertise the King
and his Kingdom’ lead to?

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
What unique and innovative methods
would Jehovah’s people use?

01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:02.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next 100 years would tell the story.

01:13:05.064 --> 01:13:09.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1922,
J.F. Rutherford began using

01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:12.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
the new technology of radio broadcasting

01:13:12.071 --> 01:13:15.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach a global audience
with the Kingdom message.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.142 line:10% position:50% align:center
At its peak in 1933,

01:13:17.142 --> 01:13:19.545 line:10% position:50% align:center
radio broadcasts originating

01:13:19.545 --> 01:13:22.915 line:10% position:50% align:center
from our own WBBR studios in New York

01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:27.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
were carried by 408 radio stations
on six continents.

01:13:28.353 --> 01:13:31.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of clergy interference,

01:13:31.356 --> 01:13:36.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
the commercial radio industry
gradually denied access to the airwaves.

01:13:37.863 --> 01:13:40.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did opposition stop Jehovah’s people

01:13:40.399 --> 01:13:43.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
from advertising the Kingdom good news?

01:13:43.702 --> 01:13:46.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
What additional preaching methods were used?

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:51.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
A unified, consistent message
about the Kingdom was achieved

01:13:51.877 --> 01:13:55.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the use of testimony cards
in several languages.

01:13:55.914 --> 01:13:59.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
A publisher would simply hand the card
to the householder

01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:02.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask him to read the brief Bible message.

01:14:02.621 --> 01:14:05.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another exciting application of technology

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:07.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the use of the portable phonograph

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
for house-to-house preaching.

01:14:10.062 --> 01:14:12.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
To expand this initiative,

01:14:12.064 --> 01:14:15.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1937 at the Columbus, Ohio, convention,

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
the special pioneer work was introduced.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Special pioneers were encouraged
to use the phonograph,

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only when invited into a house,

01:14:24.843 --> 01:14:26.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at every house.

01:14:27.913 --> 01:14:30.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the 1939 service year,

01:14:30.749 --> 01:14:34.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
300 special pioneers set up the phonographs

01:14:34.019 --> 01:14:36.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
over half a million times,

01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:38.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
playing the prerecorded,

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:40.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
four-and-half-minute talks
by Brother Rutherford

01:14:40.759 --> 01:14:43.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
to over one million listeners!

01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:46.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other Kingdom publishers
thus became “phonograph-minded,”

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:51.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually,
over 47,000 portable phonographs

01:14:51.136 --> 01:14:54.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
with records covering 92 topics

01:14:54.106 --> 01:14:55.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
trumpeted the Kingdom message.

01:14:56.608 --> 01:14:59.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Determined to preach from the housetops,

01:14:59.545 --> 01:15:02.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
zealous Kingdom publishers
amplified their ministry

01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:06.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
with transcription machines that broadcast

01:15:06.318 --> 01:15:10.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford’s full-length,
prerecorded lectures.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:12.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
A transcription machine was a phonograph

01:15:12.658 --> 01:15:15.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipped with powered loudspeakers.

01:15:15.727 --> 01:15:19.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made possible
sound cars and sound boats.

01:15:19.898 --> 01:15:24.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom message
was clearly heard on rivers, on streets,

01:15:24.903 --> 01:15:28.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
in parks and squares, in rented halls,

01:15:28.507 --> 01:15:31.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
theaters, and other public spaces.

01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:36.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Equipped with tracts, booklets,
magazines, and books,

01:15:36.315 --> 01:15:39.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
thousands of volunteers participated

01:15:39.051 --> 01:15:43.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
in special preaching
and literature distribution campaigns.

01:15:43.255 --> 01:15:46.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
These special campaigns made it possible

01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:49.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cover large areas
with the Kingdom message quickly,

01:15:49.261 --> 01:15:51.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the face of opposition.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Street work,

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:57.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
information marches,
and bicycle parades

01:15:57.102 --> 01:16:01.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
boldly brought the Kingdom message
directly before the eyes of the public.

01:16:01.406 --> 01:16:03.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marches ranged in size

01:16:03.675 --> 01:16:07.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
from just a few publishers
to about 1,000 publishers.

01:16:07.012 --> 01:16:09.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Streams of Kingdom publishers

01:16:09.414 --> 01:16:13.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
made their way through the business districts
of large cities.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:17.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wore placards bearing a slogan,
carried signs,

01:16:17.956 --> 01:16:20.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
or distributed handbills

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:23.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the title of the featured talk
at a public meeting.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
While radio broadcasts
and information marches

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:30.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
were an efficient way
of reaching mass audiences,

01:16:30.269 --> 01:16:32.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
was it the most effective way?

01:16:33.438 --> 01:16:35.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our primary method of preaching,

01:16:35.641 --> 01:16:38.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
the personal door-to-door ministry,

01:16:38.777 --> 01:16:42.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
has proved over time
to be the most effective method

01:16:42.314 --> 01:16:44.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
of advertising the Kingdom.

01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:48.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was preaching all that was needed?

01:16:48.053 --> 01:16:51.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
It became apparent that teaching others

01:16:51.423 --> 01:16:53.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to observe all the things Jesus commanded’

01:16:53.725 --> 01:16:55.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
would require training.

01:16:55.794 --> 01:16:58.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kingdom evangelizers needed to be trained

01:16:58.563 --> 01:17:02.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use the Bible effectively
and to study it with interested ones.

01:17:02.401 --> 01:17:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at the “Call to Action” Assembly in 1943,

01:17:06.405 --> 01:17:10.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new congregation meeting
was announced and demonstrated.

01:17:10.142 --> 01:17:14.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was called
the <i>Course in Theocratic Ministry, </i>

01:17:14.313 --> 01:17:16.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it accompanied
the weekly Service Meeting.

01:17:17.816 --> 01:17:20.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, textbooks were released

01:17:20.085 --> 01:17:22.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help our brothers
cultivate their teaching skills.

01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
The books <i>Theocratic Aid</i>  published in 1945

01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:30.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided clear guidance
for improved public speaking,

01:17:30.128 --> 01:17:32.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
effective door-to-door witnessing,

01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:34.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
making meaningful return visits,

01:17:34.132 --> 01:17:37.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conducting progressive Bible studies,

01:17:37.469 --> 01:17:41.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
while <i>Equipped for Every Good Work</i> 
released in 1946

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
laid a solid foundation of Bible truth

01:17:44.543 --> 01:17:49.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
through an in-depth
book-by-book examination of God’s Word.

01:17:50.515 --> 01:17:54.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Preachers were learning to become teachers.

01:17:54.219 --> 01:17:56.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such high-quality training

01:17:56.388 --> 01:18:00.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
equipped more to join
the ranks of Kingdom proclaimers.

01:18:00.058 --> 01:18:02.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for those who were already active,

01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:06.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
training allowed them
to expand their participation.

01:18:06.365 --> 01:18:09.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ranks of Kingdom publishers swelled.

01:18:09.701 --> 01:18:11.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the same time,

01:18:11.737 --> 01:18:14.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

01:18:14.373 --> 01:18:16.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
began training Kingdom proclaimers

01:18:16.508 --> 01:18:18.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take up missionary work in lands

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:22.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there were few, if any,
Kingdom publishers.

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:25.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the years since,
thousands of trained missionaries

01:18:25.717 --> 01:18:29.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
have ‘advertised the King and his Kingdom’
to the ends of the earth.

01:18:30.589 --> 01:18:34.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, the teaching tools
provided by the faithful slave 

01:18:34.092 --> 01:18:37.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
have steadily adapted to changing needs.

01:18:37.863 --> 01:18:41.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study publications such as <i>“Let God Be True,” </i>

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</i>

01:18:44.703 --> 01:18:46.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now, 

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course</i>

01:18:49.708 --> 01:18:53.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
have proved to be
extremely effective teaching tools.

01:18:55.547 --> 01:18:59.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huge international conventions
with record-breaking attendances

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:01.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
have generated global headlines

01:19:01.686 --> 01:19:04.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
advertising Jehovah’s organization.

01:19:05.223 --> 01:19:10.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Films, DVDs, and JW Broadcasting videos

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:12.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
have helped
prospective subjects of the Kingdom

01:19:12.697 --> 01:19:15.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
visualize the realities of that Kingdom.

01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:20.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Special Metropolitan Witnessing
and Public Witnessing carts

01:19:20.105 --> 01:19:23.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to draw attention to the Kingdom.

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:27.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW.ORG has played a vital role
in reaching millions

01:19:27.779 --> 01:19:31.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Kingdom proclamation
in over 1,000 languages.

01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:35.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
How true are the words of Melvin Sargent,

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:40.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of many faithful brothers
who experienced much of this history!

01:19:40.058 --> 01:19:43.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those of us inside the Lord’s organization

01:19:43.295 --> 01:19:46.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
have tried, in every way possible,

01:19:46.898 --> 01:19:51.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
to turn [the world’s] attention
to the message of life.

01:19:51.136 --> 01:19:55.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have used slogans,
full-page advertisements,

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
radio, sound cars,

01:19:58.176 --> 01:20:02.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
portable phonographs, gigantic conventions,

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
parades of information-walkers
carrying signs,

01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:10.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a growing army
of house-to-house ministers.

01:20:11.122 --> 01:20:15.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
This brief report
on the past 100 years of Kingdom preaching

01:20:15.527 --> 01:20:17.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
merely scratches the surface

01:20:17.762 --> 01:20:21.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what’s contained
in the new special exhibit

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the world headquarters museum
in Warwick, New York.

01:20:25.203 --> 01:20:26.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s entitled 

01:20:26.738 --> 01:20:30.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>ADVERTISE, ADVERTISE, ADVERTISE </i>

01:20:30.275 --> 01:20:33.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>—100 YEARS OF ADVERTISING THE KINGDOM. </i>

01:20:34.446 --> 01:20:36.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
When visits become possible,
please come

01:20:36.882 --> 01:20:40.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see this informative
and motivating display.

01:20:41.152 --> 01:20:44.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
How thrilling it is that,
alongside our brothers and sisters

01:20:44.823 --> 01:20:46.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the past 100 years,

01:20:46.858 --> 01:20:50.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have shared together
in fulfilling Jesus’ prophecy

01:20:50.595 --> 01:20:52.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “this good news of the Kingdom

01:20:52.631 --> 01:20:56.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be preached in all the inhabited earth”!

01:20:56.134 --> 01:20:59.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
May this new special exhibit energize you

01:20:59.804 --> 01:21:02.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue using every means possible

01:21:02.807 --> 01:21:06.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “advertise, advertise, advertise,

01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:09.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
the King and his Kingdom”!

01:21:15.854 --> 01:21:19.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that video was just the ticket
—wasn’t it?—

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:23.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re resuming
our door-to-door ministry now,

01:21:23.228 --> 01:21:27.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so this gets us all enthusiastic,
ready to go in service.

01:21:27.365 --> 01:21:31.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’re all ready
to go in service now.

01:21:31.503 --> 01:21:35.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t leave just yet,
because we have one final talk.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lett

01:21:37.008 --> 01:21:41.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Brother Lett always has
something interesting to tell us.

01:21:41.379 --> 01:21:43.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
No pressure, Steve.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:46.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s got a very intriguing theme:

01:21:46.851 --> 01:21:50.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why Must All Kiss God’s Son?”

01:21:54.726 --> 01:21:57.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
In four of his letters,

01:21:57.028 --> 01:22:01.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul encouraged fellow Christians

01:22:01.132 --> 01:22:05.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “greet one another with a holy kiss.”

01:22:05.637 --> 01:22:08.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Peter used the expression

01:22:08.807 --> 01:22:12.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“greet one another with a kiss of love.”

01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:16.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why was that encouragement given?

01:22:16.615 --> 01:22:18.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because giving a kiss

01:22:18.617 --> 01:22:23.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a token of affection, honor, or peace.

01:22:23.555 --> 01:22:25.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar vein,

01:22:25.624 --> 01:22:28.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Jehovah commands us to do

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 2, please.

01:22:31.663 --> 01:22:34.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go to the second Psalm,

01:22:34.332 --> 01:22:36.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 12.

01:22:36.968 --> 01:22:40.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says: “Honor

01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:43.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or, if you look at the footnote,
literally, “Kiss”

01:22:43.575 --> 01:22:46.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—kiss] the son,

01:22:46.144 --> 01:22:49.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or God will become indignant

01:22:49.681 --> 01:22:52.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will perish from the way,

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:56.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
for His [Jehovah’s] anger flares up quickly.”

01:22:57.789 --> 01:23:02.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice that Jehovah
doesn’t present this as an option, does he?

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:06.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t say,
‘I recommend, or suggest, you kiss my son.’

01:23:06.297 --> 01:23:09.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s actually presented as a decree

01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:12.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a powerful statement indeed.

01:23:12.537 --> 01:23:15.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah takes it very personally

01:23:15.807 --> 01:23:18.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we warmly, affectionately

01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:22.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
welcome his Son or not, see?

01:23:22.614 --> 01:23:25.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who do not do so

01:23:25.483 --> 01:23:29.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
—do not kiss the Son
and warmly welcome him—

01:23:29.154 --> 01:23:33.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
will perish as a result of Jehovah’s anger.

01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:36.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or, put another way,

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:40.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
such ones ‘will meet God.’

01:23:40.298 --> 01:23:43.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s talk
about this just for a little bit.

01:23:43.234 --> 01:23:46.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites,
because they were so disobedient,

01:23:46.471 --> 01:23:50.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
were warned by Jehovah
through Amos the prophet

01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:52.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Amos 4:12:

01:23:52.377 --> 01:23:57.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get ready to meet your God.”

01:23:57.148 --> 01:23:59.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that expression reminds me

01:23:59.517 --> 01:24:01.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
of when I was a young teenager

01:24:01.519 --> 01:24:04.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
growing up
in the southern part of the United States.

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:08.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along the highways, we would
often see billboards, religious billboards.

01:24:08.526 --> 01:24:10.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a common sign read:

01:24:10.929 --> 01:24:14.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you ready to meet God?”

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was supposed
to be based on Amos 4:12.

01:24:18.069 --> 01:24:21.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we asked, and it was explained
to us that the meaning was,

01:24:21.706 --> 01:24:24.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you ready to go to heaven,

01:24:24.008 --> 01:24:26.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“meet God face-to-face,

01:24:26.678 --> 01:24:28.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereafter live in heaven?”

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “meet”

01:24:30.882 --> 01:24:34.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being used with a favorable connotation.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:39.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we indicated,
that’s not the meaning of Amos 4:12

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:43.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not to get ready to introduce yourself
to God in a friendly way—

01:24:44.896 --> 01:24:46.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
far from it.

01:24:46.564 --> 01:24:51.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah through Amos
was warning those disobedient Israelites

01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:53.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they were going to meet God

01:24:53.972 --> 01:24:56.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of a head-on collision.

01:24:57.609 --> 01:24:59.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was going to be similar

01:24:59.611 --> 01:25:02.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a little ant walking on a train rail,

01:25:02.781 --> 01:25:06.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking south and being met
by a locomotive coming north.

01:25:06.618 --> 01:25:08.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the Israelites would experience.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, sure enough,
as Jehovah warned some years later,

01:25:13.491 --> 01:25:16.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Israelites “met God”

01:25:16.094 --> 01:25:19.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they received his adverse judgment

01:25:19.264 --> 01:25:24.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Assyria conquered and devastated them.

01:25:24.269 --> 01:25:26.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

01:25:26.304 --> 01:25:29.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
What get-ready-to-meet-your-God message

01:25:29.007 --> 01:25:32.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being sounded by God’s people today?

01:25:32.477 --> 01:25:37.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s true that we sound
“the good news of the Kingdom.”

01:25:37.248 --> 01:25:40.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also sound
a warning message, don’t we?

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:44.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warn that all who do not take
a stand with Jehovah

01:25:44.923 --> 01:25:49.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and walk with him
but continue to walk in opposition

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
will meet him in a head-on collision.

01:25:53.298 --> 01:25:55.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s another question:

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen in the near future

01:25:57.302 --> 01:26:00.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and we’ve learned 
during the great tribulation)

01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:03.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the tone
—the tenor—

01:26:03.708 --> 01:26:08.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our get-ready-to-meet-your-God
warning message?

01:26:08.646 --> 01:26:11.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for the answer,
let’s go to Revelation chapter 16

01:26:13.184 --> 01:26:16.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 16.

01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:18.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, please, let’s read verse 21:

01:26:20.325 --> 01:26:23.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then great hailstones,

01:26:23.328 --> 01:26:25.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each about the weight of a talent,

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:28.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fell from heaven on the people,

01:26:28.499 --> 01:26:31.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the people blasphemed God

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:34.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of the plague of hail,

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:38.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the plague was unusually great.”

01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:41.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our publications have explained

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:43.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
that, of course, right now

01:26:43.481 --> 01:26:46.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
we take the “soft” waters of truth to people,

01:26:46.517 --> 01:26:49.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
encouraging them to turn to Jehovah.

01:26:49.187 --> 01:26:51.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
But soon during the great tribulation,

01:26:51.923 --> 01:26:56.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tone, the tenor, will turn “hard.”

01:26:56.928 --> 01:26:59.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will announce the imminent end

01:26:59.731 --> 01:27:03.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Satan’s entire wicked system.

01:27:03.034 --> 01:27:06.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
The soft waters of truth will congeal

01:27:06.871 --> 01:27:11.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become
the hard-hitting hailstones of truth.

01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:15.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this message will be so powerful

01:27:15.546 --> 01:27:18.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
that, as indicated
there in that scripture we read,

01:27:18.716 --> 01:27:21.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people will blaspheme God.

01:27:21.853 --> 01:27:23.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be very upset.

01:27:23.688 --> 01:27:25.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be very disturbed.

01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:29.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s likened to a great hailstone,

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
with every hailstone

01:27:31.596 --> 01:27:35.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
(a great hailstorm,
I should say, with every hailstone)

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:39.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
weighing about a talent.

01:27:39.003 --> 01:27:41.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Revelation Climax </i> book said

01:27:41.606 --> 01:27:45.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if the apostle John
had in mind the Greek talent,

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:48.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would mean each hailstone
would weigh about 45 pounds (20 kg).

01:27:49.647 --> 01:27:53.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some years ago, interestingly,
there was a little article, or little account,

01:27:53.952 --> 01:27:58.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
in <i>The Watchtower</i>  about egg-sized hail

01:27:58.456 --> 01:28:00.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
falling in China,

01:28:00.658 --> 01:28:05.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
killing 25 people
and wounding 200 additional people.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:06.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about it.

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:10.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
If hailstones
weighing only ounces could do that,

01:28:10.635 --> 01:28:14.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
what about 45-pound hailstones

01:28:14.872 --> 01:28:19.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and especially
if you factor in how fast they fall)?

01:28:19.577 --> 01:28:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Experts say a large hailstone

01:28:22.981 --> 01:28:25.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
can fall at speeds

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:29.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
faster than 100 miles an hour (160 km/hr).

01:28:29.821 --> 01:28:32.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly, not long ago 

01:28:32.423 --> 01:28:36.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> made
the comment that it could well be

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:40.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our hailstone message
that we’re commissioned to give

01:28:40.365 --> 01:28:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be what induces Gog of Magog

01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:48.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make his all-out attack
against Jehovah’s people

01:28:48.473 --> 01:28:52.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the intention
of wiping them from the earth.

01:28:52.243 --> 01:28:55.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
we know the attack of Gog is the event

01:28:55.947 --> 01:28:58.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will enrage Jehovah

01:28:58.616 --> 01:29:01.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move him to bring on

01:29:01.319 --> 01:29:04.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rescue operation of Armageddon.

01:29:05.289 --> 01:29:10.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
But right now we’re still
in the kiss-God’s-Son invitation time period.

01:29:11.696 --> 01:29:13.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy about that, right?

01:29:14.732 --> 01:29:17.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t get too comfortable
with that message either.

01:29:19.237 --> 01:29:22.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
We entreat honesthearted ones

01:29:22.373 --> 01:29:24.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to honor God’s Son

01:29:24.842 --> 01:29:28.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to warmly welcome him 
as earth’s new ruler.

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do this urgently
—don’t we?—

01:29:31.249 --> 01:29:35.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time before that hard-hitting,

01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:39.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
get-ready-to-meet-your-God
time period arrives.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:42.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a very important question:

01:29:42.293 --> 01:29:44.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we motivated

01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:47.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kiss God’s Son only because we don’t want

01:29:47.565 --> 01:29:52.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
to experience the adverse consequences
of not doing so?

01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:57.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, our main motivator is love, isn’t it?

01:29:58.009 --> 01:30:00.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love Jehovah,

01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:02.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love his dear Son,

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we long for him to be earth’s new ruler.

01:30:06.517 --> 01:30:10.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
That love is what
mainly motivates us to do so,

01:30:10.755 --> 01:30:13.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kiss—welcome—God’s Son.

01:30:13.157 --> 01:30:16.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, we want to help
honesthearted ones as we teach them

01:30:16.894 --> 01:30:19.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
to likewise kiss God’s Son

01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:22.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are motivated by love.

01:30:22.767 --> 01:30:26.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus is Jehovah’s choice, isn’t he?

01:30:26.871 --> 01:30:29.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has selected him

01:30:29.774 --> 01:30:33.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has installed him as King of the Kingdom,

01:30:33.277 --> 01:30:36.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will be the absolute best ruler

01:30:36.013 --> 01:30:38.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans could ever have.

01:30:38.649 --> 01:30:39.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:43.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will make Jesus the very best ruler?

01:30:43.154 --> 01:30:48.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one thing:
He will have superhuman abilities,

01:30:48.126 --> 01:30:52.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will demonstrate and will have these
during his Thousand Year Reign.

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:56.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will make him a wonderful,
very loving ruler.

01:30:56.901 --> 01:30:58.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, let’s identify

01:30:58.903 --> 01:31:01.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
six superhuman abilities

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:04.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will possess and demonstrate

01:31:04.575 --> 01:31:07.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
during his wonderful Thousand Year Reign.

01:31:07.778 --> 01:31:12.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to identify each
of these six superhuman abilities,

01:31:12.283 --> 01:31:17.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to use a miracle
that Jesus performed here on the earth,

01:31:17.321 --> 01:31:21.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know
the earthly miracles portend, or foreshadow,

01:31:21.092 --> 01:31:23.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
even greater miracles

01:31:23.294 --> 01:31:26.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
during his time as Messianic King.

01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:29.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now turn, please, to Mark chapter 4,

01:31:30.334 --> 01:31:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s identify

01:31:33.304 --> 01:31:35.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
superhuman ability number one.

01:31:35.806 --> 01:31:39.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark 4:37 says:

01:31:40.511 --> 01:31:45.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now a great violent windstorm broke out,

01:31:45.183 --> 01:31:48.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the waves kept crashing into the boat,

01:31:48.853 --> 01:31:52.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the boat was close to being swamped.

01:31:52.957 --> 01:31:56.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he [Jesus] was in the stern,

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sleeping on the pillow.

01:31:58.596 --> 01:32:00.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they woke him up and said to him:

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:05.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Teacher, do you not care
that we are about to perish?’

01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:10.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that he got up and rebuked the wind

01:32:10.541 --> 01:32:12.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to the sea:

01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:16.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Hush! Be quiet!’

01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the wind abated,
and a great calm set in.”

01:32:21.018 --> 01:32:23.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did you notice that that windstorm

01:32:23.721 --> 01:32:26.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
is described with a double adjective

01:32:26.824 --> 01:32:29.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“great violent windstorm”—

01:32:29.694 --> 01:32:32.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating its ferocity?

01:32:32.096 --> 01:32:34.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with three simple words

01:32:34.198 --> 01:32:36.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“Hush! Be quiet!”—

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus completely calmed both wind and sea.

01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:44.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what does that miracle
portend for the future?

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:47.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as Messianic King,

01:32:47.011 --> 01:32:49.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will have the power

01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:53.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
to command and control the wind, the sea

01:32:54.919 --> 01:32:57.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actually, all forces of nature—

01:32:57.655 --> 01:33:00.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
to mankind’s benefit.

01:33:00.258 --> 01:33:04.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under Kingdom rule,
there will be no destructive tsunamis,

01:33:04.562 --> 01:33:07.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:10.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
earthquakes, etcetera, etcetera.

01:33:11.802 --> 01:33:16.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s identify
superhuman ability number two.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:19.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to do this,
just think about the account, if you will,

01:33:19.577 --> 01:33:22.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Matthew chapter 14.

01:33:22.046 --> 01:33:26.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you recall, with just five loaves of bread

01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:28.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two little fish,

01:33:28.586 --> 01:33:31.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus fed a crowd,

01:33:31.122 --> 01:33:33.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely of over 10,000 people

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:37.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you factor in the women and children.

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:39.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every one of them

01:33:39.330 --> 01:33:42.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
ate to complete satisfaction.

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, they even “[gathered] up

01:33:44.302 --> 01:33:47.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
12 baskets full of fragments”

01:33:47.805 --> 01:33:49.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
as leftovers.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:52.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from this miracle?

01:33:52.677 --> 01:33:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, as Messianic King,

01:33:55.112 --> 01:33:57.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
will exercise authority

01:33:57.715 --> 01:34:02.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the organic elements
in food and vegetation,

01:34:02.086 --> 01:34:04.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensuring that no one

01:34:04.689 --> 01:34:07.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
under his rule ever goes hungry.

01:34:07.692 --> 01:34:10.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is estimated that right now

01:34:10.194 --> 01:34:13.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 800 million people
go to bed at night hungry.

01:34:14.765 --> 01:34:18.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
That number will be reduced to zero

01:34:18.969 --> 01:34:20.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Kingdom rule.

01:34:20.971 --> 01:34:24.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one will have to go
to bed hungry at night.

01:34:24.975 --> 01:34:27.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 72:16 says:

01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:30.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

01:34:30.114 --> 01:34:34.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.”

01:34:34.185 --> 01:34:36.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it won’t be just basics.

01:34:36.253 --> 01:34:38.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 25:6 says:

01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:42.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies
will make for all the peoples

01:34:42.593 --> 01:34:46.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that means nobody is left out
—for all the peoples]

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:50.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a banquet of rich dishes,

01:34:50.735 --> 01:34:55.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
a banquet of fine wine, . . . filtered wine.”

01:34:56.674 --> 01:34:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re not talking about Ripple
or Thunderbird wine here.

01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:06.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re talking about fine wine,

01:35:07.318 --> 01:35:11.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Jesus made
at that wedding feast in Cana.

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:16.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s identify
superhuman ability number three.

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go, please, to Matthew chapter 15

01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:21.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 15—

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:26.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read,
please, verse number 30:

01:35:28.239 --> 01:35:31.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then large crowds approached him,

01:35:31.776 --> 01:35:34.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“bringing along people who were lame,

01:35:34.912 --> 01:35:39.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“maimed, blind, speechless, and many others,

01:35:39.917 --> 01:35:42.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they laid them at his feet,

01:35:42.686 --> 01:35:44.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he cured them.”

01:35:46.023 --> 01:35:48.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was amazing, wasn’t it?

01:35:48.726 --> 01:35:52.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did these healing miracles portend

01:35:52.396 --> 01:35:55.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jesus as Messianic King?

01:35:55.466 --> 01:35:57.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he will have the power

01:35:57.868 --> 01:36:01.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the authority to heal

01:36:01.472 --> 01:36:05.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
all sicknesses and maladies.

01:36:05.476 --> 01:36:10.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, any sickness, any malady,
he will heal under Kingdom rule,

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:12.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
as promised at Isaiah 33:24:

01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:16.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident [not one]

01:36:16.053 --> 01:36:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
will say: ‘I am sick.’”

01:36:18.956 --> 01:36:23.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus will even have the power
to put the human aging process

01:36:23.961 --> 01:36:27.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
into reverse with ones becoming

01:36:27.631 --> 01:36:30.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
young physically.

01:36:30.167 --> 01:36:32.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall this video clip?

01:36:32.336 --> 01:36:34.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was shown at a convention

01:36:37.007 --> 01:36:39.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
some years ago.

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:41.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re not seeing in this

01:36:41.712 --> 01:36:45.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
portion of this video a fantasy. 

01:36:47.151 --> 01:36:50.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re looking at reality.

01:36:50.988 --> 01:36:54.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one brother said:
“Can you imagine getting up in the morning?

01:36:54.258 --> 01:36:57.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You put your glasses on,
and you can’t see anything!

01:36:58.629 --> 01:37:00.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everything is blurry.

01:37:00.631 --> 01:37:04.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take them off,
and now you can see beautifully!”

01:37:04.835 --> 01:37:08.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not fantasy—we’re talking about reality

01:37:08.038 --> 01:37:11.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s new world.

01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:15.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s identify
superhuman ability number four.

01:37:15.112 --> 01:37:19.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to do this, just think, if you will,
of the account in Mark chapter 5.

01:37:20.317 --> 01:37:23.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you recall, very sadly

01:37:23.721 --> 01:37:25.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
—heart-wrenchingly—

01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:29.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little 12-year-old girl had died.

01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:31.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus do?

01:37:31.996 --> 01:37:35.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account tells us
he took her hand and said:

01:37:35.065 --> 01:37:39.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Little girl, I say to you, get up!”

01:37:39.537 --> 01:37:42.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
That girl who had been dead immediately rose

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began walking.

01:37:45.643 --> 01:37:50.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what future accomplishment
is signified by this miracle?

01:37:50.247 --> 01:37:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus and his 144,000 associate kings

01:37:54.385 --> 01:37:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have the power

01:37:56.387 --> 01:38:00.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
to completely empty the grave,

01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:03.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
the common grave of dead mankind,

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the resurrection.

01:38:05.663 --> 01:38:08.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, according to Revelation 20:14,

01:38:08.766 --> 01:38:11.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
the empty “Grave”

01:38:11.101 --> 01:38:14.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be thrown
into the symbolic “lake of fire.”

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:17.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be abolished forever,

01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:21.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
never again to receive another occupant.

01:38:22.947 --> 01:38:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s isolate
superhuman ability number five

01:38:26.917 --> 01:38:28.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Matthew chapter 9, please.

01:38:28.919 --> 01:38:30.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn there.

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:32.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 9

01:38:34.925 --> 01:38:39.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read beginning
in verse number 3—Matthew 9:3:

01:38:40.898 --> 01:38:44.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now certain scribes said to themselves:

01:38:44.735 --> 01:38:47.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This fellow is blaspheming.’

01:38:47.571 --> 01:38:52.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said:

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:55.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why are you thinking
wicked things in your hearts?’”

01:38:56.847 --> 01:39:01.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice that Jesus
could read hearts there as a perfect human.

01:39:02.386 --> 01:39:04.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about as a Messianic King?

01:39:04.388 --> 01:39:05.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even more so.

01:39:05.889 --> 01:39:10.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and the 144,000
will be able to read hearts.

01:39:10.027 --> 01:39:12.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that means what?

01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:15.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be able to perfectly judge mankind

01:39:15.065 --> 01:39:18.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
with absolutely no mistakes

01:39:18.869 --> 01:39:20.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
—amazing indeed!

01:39:20.904 --> 01:39:25.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s determine one more,
a sixth superhuman,

01:39:25.542 --> 01:39:29.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
miraculous ability that Jesus
will possess and demonstrate.

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to do this.

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:33.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Matthew chapter 8,

01:39:33.517 --> 01:39:35.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
just back a little bit
from where you were there

01:39:35.819 --> 01:39:39.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 8:16:

01:39:40.457 --> 01:39:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But after it became evening,

01:39:43.293 --> 01:39:45.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“people brought him

01:39:45.562 --> 01:39:49.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“many demon-possessed ones;

01:39:49.266 --> 01:39:53.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he expelled the spirits with a word,

01:39:53.337 --> 01:39:56.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he cured all who were suffering.”

01:39:56.607 --> 01:40:00.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice, rather than risk a decisive test

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:02.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the power that was backing Jesus,

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
the demons obeyed his command

01:40:05.315 --> 01:40:10.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to release these people
that they were possessing.

01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from this?

01:40:12.022 --> 01:40:13.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this prefigure?

01:40:13.857 --> 01:40:16.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus and the 144,000

01:40:16.927 --> 01:40:20.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have the power to act

01:40:20.597 --> 01:40:22.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Satan and his demons,

01:40:22.866 --> 01:40:25.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus even granted on the earth

01:40:25.335 --> 01:40:28.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
his disciples that same authority, didn’t he?

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:30.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were able to expel demons.

01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:33.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they will certainly have the power,
even more so,

01:40:33.077 --> 01:40:36.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take action against Satan and his demons

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of the thousand years.

01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:41.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end
of the great tribulation (I should say),

01:40:41.585 --> 01:40:45.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
first they will abyss them.

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:49.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then at the end of the final test,
at the end of the thousand years,

01:40:50.127 --> 01:40:55.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, joined by
the secondary seed of Abraham,

01:40:55.132 --> 01:40:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
as promised at Genesis 3:15,

01:40:58.535 --> 01:41:01.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
(Jesus) will crush

01:41:01.972 --> 01:41:04.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ugliest head in the universe,

01:41:05.576 --> 01:41:07.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan’s head.

01:41:07.578 --> 01:41:09.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he will crush

01:41:09.646 --> 01:41:13.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
the second-ugliest heads in the universe,
the heads of the demons.

01:41:13.951 --> 01:41:16.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tremendous accomplishment

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and vindication
of Jehovah’s name and sovereignty

01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:21.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be!

01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have six marvelous,

01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:27.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
miraculous, superhuman abilities

01:41:27.598 --> 01:41:32.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will possess
and exercise during his reign.

01:41:32.402 --> 01:41:35.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Human rulers, if we think about it,

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:39.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
couldn’t even dream to ever possess

01:41:39.176 --> 01:41:43.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
even one of those superhuman abilities.

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus will be able to

01:41:45.249 --> 01:41:49.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) command and control the forces of nature

01:41:49.353 --> 01:41:51.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the benefit of all humans;

01:41:51.488 --> 01:41:55.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) exercise authority
over food and vegetation,

01:41:55.726 --> 01:41:58.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensuring that no one ever goes hungry;

01:41:58.929 --> 01:42:03.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) possess the power
to heal all sicknesses and maladies;

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) have the capability
to completely empty the grave

01:42:08.405 --> 01:42:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the resurrection;

01:42:11.441 --> 01:42:14.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
(5) possess the ability

01:42:14.678 --> 01:42:17.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
to perfectly judge humans

01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:20.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
with absolutely no mistakes;

01:42:20.484 --> 01:42:23.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (6) be empowered

01:42:23.187 --> 01:42:27.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to act against Satan and his demons.

01:42:27.157 --> 01:42:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it, the foregoing

01:42:29.993 --> 01:42:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
are only a few examples
of the superhuman royal power that Jesus

01:42:34.998 --> 01:42:38.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
will possess as Messianic King.

01:42:38.202 --> 01:42:41.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder he’s Jehovah’s choice!

01:42:41.972 --> 01:42:46.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no wonder
Jehovah has issued the decree

01:42:46.376 --> 01:42:50.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all—not optional, all— must kiss,

01:42:50.247 --> 01:42:52.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
warmly welcome, his Son.

01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:55.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true that a kiss
can be hypocritical, can’t it?

01:42:57.087 --> 01:43:01.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Absalom gave off, or gave out,

01:43:01.458 --> 01:43:05.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
(I’d probably better say gave off)
many hypocritical kisses.

01:43:05.462 --> 01:43:07.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was kissing everybody, wasn’t he?

01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:09.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hypocritical!

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read the account of treacherous Joab,

01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:16.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
who hypocritically kissed Amasa

01:43:16.807 --> 01:43:20.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
just before he murdered him.

01:43:20.077 --> 01:43:23.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by means of a disgusting,

01:43:23.313 --> 01:43:27.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
hypocritical, “tender kiss,”

01:43:27.284 --> 01:43:30.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judas betrayed Jesus.

01:43:30.387 --> 01:43:35.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, brothers and sisters,
our “kiss of Jesus” is not hypocritical.

01:43:35.325 --> 01:43:37.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the bottom of our heart

01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:40.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
—by our conduct, by our words—

01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:44.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
we warmly welcome
Jehovah’s choice, don’t we?

01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:48.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so happy,
and we tell everybody about this,

01:43:48.672 --> 01:43:51.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he is already installed as King

01:43:51.108 --> 01:43:54.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he will soon
be the Ruler of all the earth.

01:43:54.778 --> 01:43:59.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to help
honesthearted ones to likewise sincerely,

01:43:59.549 --> 01:44:03.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
affectionately, kiss—welcome—God’s Son.

01:44:03.053 --> 01:44:05.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do this urgently

01:44:05.322 --> 01:44:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the limited window of time

01:44:08.125 --> 01:44:12.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this kiss-God’s-Son
invitation time period

01:44:12.262 --> 01:44:17.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before the it’s-now-too-late
time period arrives,

01:44:17.301 --> 01:44:22.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
when ones will be told:
“Get ready to meet your God.”

01:44:22.272 --> 01:44:26.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, sadly,
as we know, the vast majority,

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially the rulers,

01:44:28.812 --> 01:44:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
will adamantly continue to do so.

01:44:32.215 --> 01:44:36.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we are not like them,
because for these ones,

01:44:36.219 --> 01:44:40.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
the anger of Jehovah and Jesus
will blaze against them.

01:44:40.824 --> 01:44:45.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may Jehovah richly bless you,
dear brothers and sisters,

01:44:45.429 --> 01:44:49.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you continue to affectionately

01:44:49.599 --> 01:44:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
and warmly welcome Jehovah’s choice

01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:56.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as you work hard

01:44:56.206 --> 01:45:00.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help other honesthearted ones
to do the same.

01:45:09.453 --> 01:45:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was very encouraging, wasn’t it?

01:45:13.423 --> 01:45:17.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think we can say
that Jehovah has been very good to us today.

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:21.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given us the encouragement

01:45:21.164 --> 01:45:24.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve all desperately needed.

01:45:24.568 --> 01:45:27.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so if you felt
encouraged by this program,

01:45:27.904 --> 01:45:30.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
thank Jehovah for it.

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:32.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re also grateful

01:45:32.075 --> 01:45:35.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to the brothers
who have presented parts of the program,

01:45:35.846 --> 01:45:39.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we think of the many
who worked tirelessly

01:45:39.916 --> 01:45:43.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind the scenes preparing all those videos.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was watching all that, I was thinking

01:45:45.188 --> 01:45:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a tremendous amount of work
must have been involved.

01:45:48.525 --> 01:45:52.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, how can you replace a video

01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:55.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the vision, the visibility of it.

01:45:55.665 --> 01:45:57.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just makes so much more—

01:45:57.667 --> 01:46:00.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s much more meaningful for us all.

01:46:00.337 --> 01:46:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re grateful for the brothers
who do all of this work.

01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:07.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never disappoints!

01:46:07.344 --> 01:46:10.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout this annual meeting program,

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve seen how he instructs us personally,

01:46:13.617 --> 01:46:16.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
cares for us during crises,

01:46:16.186 --> 01:46:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satisfies us with meaningful work.

01:46:19.756 --> 01:46:21.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
How fitting it is then

01:46:21.758 --> 01:46:24.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the yeartext for 2023

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:29.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
praises the God whose actions
and words are the essence of truth!

01:46:30.434 --> 01:46:32.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,

01:46:32.436 --> 01:46:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s go to Bangladesh,

01:46:34.571 --> 01:46:37.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
a land filled with unique features.

01:46:37.741 --> 01:46:41.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has the largest contiguous
mangrove forest in the world,

01:46:41.978 --> 01:46:43.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
called the Sundarbans,

01:46:43.513 --> 01:46:46.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is teeming with interesting creatures.

01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
The plant life is amazing as well.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bangladesh is also home to jackfruit.

01:46:54.091 --> 01:46:57.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
This sweet, nutritious treat

01:46:57.027 --> 01:47:01.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the world’s largest fruit grown on trees.

01:47:01.164 --> 01:47:06.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
One piece of fruit can weigh over 40 pounds,
or 18 kilograms!

01:47:07.838 --> 01:47:10.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three rivers—the Jamuna,

01:47:10.507 --> 01:47:13.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Padma, and the Meghna—

01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:17.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
combine to form
the world’s largest river delta.

01:47:17.614 --> 01:47:22.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here along the bay
lies much of the country’s population,

01:47:22.185 --> 01:47:25.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
who depend on its
rich resources for survival.

01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:31.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spiritually speaking,
the land is also full of potential.

01:47:31.628 --> 01:47:36.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bengali is the seventh
most spoken language in the world.

01:47:36.066 --> 01:47:39.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a ratio of more
than half a million people

01:47:39.836 --> 01:47:41.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
to one publisher.

01:47:41.972 --> 01:47:46.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among those answering
the call to preach are zealous young ones.

01:47:46.176 --> 01:47:50.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
They skillfully use the Bible
to show how it promises relief.

01:47:50.714 --> 01:47:54.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put to full use
the recently released Bengali edition

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</i>

01:47:59.723 --> 01:48:04.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
These young ones also love
to encourage their brothers and sisters

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:06.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
with song and dance

01:48:06.296 --> 01:48:10.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and drawings of Jehovah’s creation,
such as the native Bengal tiger.

01:48:12.369 --> 01:48:15.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful when a congregation

01:48:15.038 --> 01:48:17.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s so diverse in age, ethnicity,

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:22.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and background can worship,
eat, and play together.

01:48:23.547 --> 01:48:27.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Shahjadpur Congregation 
is just such a group,

01:48:27.951 --> 01:48:32.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its 69 publishers warmly say to you all,

01:48:32.489 --> 01:48:36.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Amra apnader bhalobashi,”</i>

01:48:36.226 --> 01:48:39.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “We love you.”

01:48:39.362 --> 01:48:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:48:43.266 --> 01:48:46.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
