00:00:01 Is the following statement true or false?
00:00:06 “Truth is relative.”
00:00:09 That statement is not relatively but absolutely false.
00:00:13 Some think that something is truth for one person
00:00:17 but not truth for another person.
00:00:20 Many religious organizations claim to have the truth.
00:00:24 However, between them there are many contradicting teachings.
00:00:30 Is this just another evidence that all truth is relative
00:00:34 —that there is no absolute truth?
00:00:37 No.
00:00:38 The truth is that truth is not relative;
00:00:42 it is absolute.
00:00:44 Those who say truth is relative
00:00:46 are not only relatively but absolutely wrong.
00:00:51 The Hebrew word for “truth,” ʼemethʹ,
00:00:54 is often rendered “truth”
00:00:57 and may designate what is firm,
00:01:00 trustworthy, stable, or faithful.
00:01:04 The Greek word for “truth,” a·leʹthei·a,
00:01:08 originates with a word meaning “not concealed,”
00:01:12 so the truth often involves the revealing
00:01:15 of that which was formerly hidden.
00:01:19 Jesus said according to Luke 12:2:
00:01:24 “But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed,
00:01:29 and nothing secret that will not become known.”
00:01:33 There are over 70 places in the Gospel accounts
00:01:37 where Jesus is said to have used a unique expression
00:01:40 to emphasize the truthfulness of his words.
00:01:44 He would often say “Amen”
00:01:47 to introduce a sentence.
00:01:51 The corresponding Hebrew word meant “certain, true.”
00:01:56 Notes The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology:
00:02:01 “By introducing his words with amen
00:02:05 “Jesus labelled them as certain and reliable.
00:02:09 “He stood by them and made them binding
00:02:12 on himself and his hearers.”
00:02:16 The New International Dictionary  of New Testament Theology,
00:02:20 Volume 3, page 901, says:
00:02:25 “[Many people try] to ‘unmask’ everything,
00:02:30 “in the belief that no one and nothing
00:02:32 “can genuinely lay claim to truth. . . .
00:02:36 “Truth can indeed be found . . .
00:02:39 “[We need to display] a humble submission to truth
00:02:42 “whenever and wherever it emerges.
00:02:45 “Such openness to truth is required
00:02:48 “of those who worship the God of truth . . .
00:02:51 “Reverence for truth ensures honesty
00:02:55 “in a man’s dealings with his neighbour,
00:02:57 “both in word and deed.
00:03:00 “This is the attitude . . . to which both the O[ld] T[estament]
00:03:04 and the N[ew] T[estament] bear witness.”
00:03:10 Does the truth ever change?
00:03:13 That question was raised by V. R. Ruggiero
00:03:18 in his book The Art of Thinking.
00:03:21 His answer is no.
00:03:24 To quote him:
00:03:26 “It may sometimes seem to [that it changes],
00:03:29 but on closer inspection it will be found not to.”
00:03:34 Yes, the truth never changes!
00:03:38 “Consider,” he says, “the case of the authorship
00:03:42 “of the first book of the Bible, the book of Genesis.
00:03:46 “For centuries Christians and Jews alike
00:03:49 “believed that the book had a single author.
00:03:52 “In time this view was challenged,
00:03:55 “and eventually replaced by the belief
00:03:58 “that as many as five authors contributed to Genesis.
00:04:03 “Then, in 1981,
00:04:05 “the results of a 5-year linguistic analysis of Genesis
00:04:10 “were published, stating that there is
00:04:13 “an 82 percent probability of single authorship,
00:04:17 “as originally thought.
00:04:21 “Has the truth about the authorship of Genesis changed?
00:04:25 “No.
00:04:26 Only our belief has changed.”
00:04:32 He also wrote:
00:04:33 “The truth will not be changed by our knowledge or by our ignorance.”
00:04:39 And we agree.
00:04:41 In fact, no one really believes that there is no truth.
00:04:45 When it comes to physical realities,
00:04:48 such as medicine, mathematics, or the laws of physics,
00:04:52 all people believe that some things are true.
00:04:57 Who of us would dare to ride in an airplane
00:04:59 if we didn’t believe that the laws of aerodynamics
00:05:02 were absolute truths?
00:05:05 Verifiable truths do exist.
00:05:08 They surround us, and we stake our lives on them.
00:05:14 Does the truth ever change?
00:05:16 It does not.
00:05:19 Our understanding of truth changes
00:05:22 as we progress in understanding it,
00:05:24 but the truth never changes.
00:05:29 When Jesus said that our purpose in life was to talk about the truth,
00:05:34 he was speaking of something that faithful Jews had valued
00:05:37 for centuries.
00:05:39 In their sacred writings, the Jews had long read of truth
00:05:44 as something concrete, not theoretical.
00:05:49 In the Bible, “truth” translates the Hebrew word ʼemethʹ,
00:05:54 which signifies that which is firm, solid
00:05:58 and, perhaps most of all, reliable.
00:06:03 The Jews had good reason for viewing truth in that way.
00:06:08 They called their God, “Jehovah, the God of truth.”
00:06:13 This was because everything Jehovah said he would do, he did.
00:06:18 When he made promises, he kept them.
00:06:20 When he inspired prophecies, they were fulfilled.
00:06:24 When he uttered final judgments, they were carried out.
00:06:29 Millions of Israelites had been eyewitnesses of these realities.
00:06:34 The inspired writers of the Bible
00:06:36 recorded them as indisputable facts of history.
00:06:41 Unlike other books viewed as sacred,
00:06:43 the Bible is not set against a backdrop of myth or legend.
00:06:49 It is firmly grounded in verifiable facts
00:06:54 —historical, archaeological, scientific,
00:06:58 and sociological realities.
00:07:03 No wonder the psalmist says to Jehovah:
00:07:06 “Your law is truth. . . .
00:07:09 “All your commandments are truth. . . .
00:07:12 The very essence of your word is truth”!
00:07:17 Since Jehovah God is the Author of the Bible,
00:07:20 the Bible is truth.
00:07:23 Jesus Christ echoed the words of that psalm
00:07:26 when he said in prayer to Jehovah:
00:07:28 “Your word is truth.”
00:07:32 Jesus knew that everything his Father spoke
00:07:35 was absolutely firm and reliable.
00:07:39 Likewise, Jesus himself was “full of . . . truth.”
00:07:44 Yes,  Jesus was even the personification of truth.
00:07:50 The Mosaic Law was truth.
00:07:53 But it was not the full truth.
00:07:56 Jesus taught something different from the Mosaic Law.
00:08:00 The Bible shows that the Mosaic Law
00:08:02 was a “shadow,” or prophetic picture,
00:08:05 of greater realities, which came true through Christ.
00:08:10 So the Mosaic Law was not the full truth
00:08:13 but a pattern of it.
00:08:17 Jesus was not the shadow but the reality.
00:08:21 He said at John 14:6:
00:08:24 “I am . . . the truth.”
00:08:28 But as far as teachings are concerned, what is truth?
00:08:32 What helps us to understand it?
00:08:35 The Bible speaks of “the spirit of the truth.”
00:08:39 What is “the spirit of the truth”?
00:08:42 It is the spirit that proceeds from Jehovah God.
00:08:46 It is pure and holy.
00:08:49 Jesus told his disciples at John 16:12, 13:
00:08:55 “I still have many things to say to you,
00:08:58 “but you are not able to bear them now.
00:09:00 “However, when that one comes,
00:09:03 “the spirit of the truth,
00:09:05 “he will guide you into all the truth,
00:09:07 “for he will not speak of his own initiative,
00:09:10 “but what he hears he will speak,
00:09:13 “and he will declare to you
00:09:15 the things to come.”
00:09:18 God’s spirit would teach them everything they needed to know
00:09:21 to carry out their work,
00:09:23 recalling and opening up their understanding
00:09:27 to things they had previously heard from Jesus
00:09:30 but had not understood.
00:09:33 God’s spirit would also declare to them the things coming,
00:09:38 including the bringing to light
00:09:40 the significance of Jesus’ death and resurrection,
00:09:44 as these events were then yet future
00:09:46 and were among the things
00:09:48 that his disciples did not understand in the beginning.
00:09:53 Brother Charles Taze Russell wrote the book
00:09:56 The Divine Plan of the Ages.
00:09:59 It was published in 1886.
00:10:03 It included a discussion on
00:10:05 “The Bible as a Divine Revelation
00:10:08 Viewed in the Light of Reason.”
00:10:11 It said:
00:10:13 “The depth and power and wisdom and scope of the Bible’s testimony
00:10:18 convince us that not man, but Almighty God, is the author.”
00:10:25 To appreciate the truth more,
00:10:28 to what can we compare the truth?
00:10:31 Truth is like a mirror that helps us to see the facts
00:10:36 and, if necessary, to improve our looks.
00:10:40 Truth is like a pillar —firm and supportive—
00:10:45 and it helps to combat false teachings.
00:10:49 Truth is also compared to a girdle, or “belt,”
00:10:53 that warriors used.
00:10:55 It helps us to continue with right conduct.
00:10:59 Truth is like a rainbow for beauty.
00:11:03 Truth is as beautiful as the song of the nightingale.
00:11:08 Truth is like a romantic bonfire for warmth
00:11:12 on a cold evening.
00:11:14 Here is an illustration that many of you will like:
00:11:18 Truth is like the first cup of coffee in the morning,
00:11:21 invigorating somebody.
00:11:23 Yes, truth is invigorating.
00:11:27 Truth is like a magnet,
00:11:29 drawing honest-hearted ones to God.
00:11:33 Truth is like an oasis in the desert.
00:11:37 Truth is like an anchor in the stormy seas.
00:11:41 Truth is like a lifeboat on a sinking ship.
00:11:45 Truth is like a lighthouse in the night,
00:11:48 guiding a boat safely to the shore or harbor.
00:11:52 Truth is like a compass showing sailors the way.
00:11:57 But it is also like a compass
00:11:59 showing the way out of a jungle to a safe area.
00:12:03 Truth is like the rising sun bathing the landscape in warm light.
00:12:10 Truth is like the display of fireworks for beauty.
00:12:14 Truth is like the magnetic shield around the earth,
00:12:18 protecting it from deathly cosmic radiation.
00:12:24 Truth is like light.
00:12:26 “The fruitage of the light consists of every sort of . . . truth.”
00:12:31 He that “does what is true
00:12:33 comes to the light,” the Bible says.
00:12:36 Imagine you were born blind and received eyesight through an operation.
00:12:41 Wouldn’t you be elated?
00:12:44 Truth is like that when somebody comes to know and appreciate it.
00:12:50 Truth is like beautiful music played solo or by an orchestra.
00:12:56 Truth is like the most delicious food for taste and gives strength.
00:13:02 Truth is what a nursing mother is to her baby.
00:13:07 Truth is like a hidden treasure; we need to dig for it.
00:13:12 Truth is like refreshing water on a hot day.
00:13:16 Truth is like a mighty river.
00:13:19 If you try to stop it with a dam, it will overflow the dam.
00:13:24 Nobody can stop the truth.
00:13:27 Why?
00:13:28 Because Jehovah, the Almighty, is backing it up.
00:13:33 Truth is like a flower
00:13:35 or even a bouquet of beautiful little flowers.
00:13:39 Brother Russell once wrote:
00:13:41 “Truth, like a modest little flower
00:13:44 “in the wilderness of life,
00:13:46 “is surrounded and almost  choked
00:13:49 “by the luxuriant growth of the weeds of error.
00:13:53 “If you would find it you must be ever on the lookout.
00:13:56 “If you would see its beauty you must brush aside the weeds of error
00:14:00 “and the brambles of bigotry.
00:14:03 “If you would possess it you must stoop to get it.
00:14:08 “Be not content with one  flower of truth.
00:14:13 “Had one been sufficient there would have been no more.
00:14:18 Gather ever, seek for more.”
00:14:22 Truth is like a fragrance, or perfume.
00:14:26 Truth is like a sparkling diamond.
00:14:28 Do you love diamonds?
00:14:31 But the truth’s value is so much more than diamonds
00:14:34 because it brings Jehovah’s friendship
00:14:37 and leads to everlasting life.
00:14:42 Truth is compared to a way on which we walk.
00:14:45 Second Peter 2:2 speaks of “the way of the truth.”
00:14:50 ‘God is a Spirit,
00:14:52 and those who worship him must do so with spirit and truth.’
00:14:58 Now is the time to study the truth
00:15:00 and attend Christian meetings where the truth is taught.
00:15:04 Do not miss congregation meetings.
00:15:07 First Timothy 3:15 compares the congregation
00:15:11 with “a pillar . . . of the truth.”
00:15:15 The congregation preserves the purity of the truth
00:15:18 and upholds it.
00:15:20 True, Jehovah teaches us through the Bible
00:15:22 but also through Christian meetings.
00:15:26 We are also to speak the truth by preaching.
00:15:29 We speak the truth also with one another.
00:15:33 We have the truth on our lips;
00:15:35 we have the truth around our hips.
00:15:38 Ephesians 6:14 says
00:15:41 that we have “the belt of truth fastened around [our] waist.”
00:15:46 The world is in utter confusion.
00:15:52 What a blessing it is to know the truth!
00:15:55 We rejoice in it!
00:15:57 We are ready to preach the truth and teach the truth.
00:16:02 Yes, we talk the truth, and we walk in the truth.
00:16:06 At 3 John 3, we read:
00:16:09 “Go on walking in the truth.”
00:16:13 Those who walk in the truth now will walk forever.
00:16:17 Micah 4:5 says:
00:16:20 “For all the peoples will walk, each in the name of its god,
00:16:25 “we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God
00:16:28 forever and ever.”
00:16:30 And that is a long time!
00:16:36 Help your students to love the truth and to live the truth
00:16:41 but, if necessary, to be willing to die for the truth and for Jehovah.
00:16:46 The truth is invincible and will conquer this wicked world.
00:16:50 May we all, including our relatives
00:16:53 and our Bible students,
00:16:55 have the determination to walk in the truth
00:16:58 and talk about the truth.
00:17:00 Why shall we do this?
00:17:02 Because we love the truth and we love the God of truth.
00:17:08 We are also to live the truth by our Christian conduct.
00:17:12 Brothers, this is the truth!
00:17:15 His Word is truth.
00:17:17 Keep talking the truth, and keep walking in the truth.
00:17:21 Then you will walk forever and praise our loving God of truth!
