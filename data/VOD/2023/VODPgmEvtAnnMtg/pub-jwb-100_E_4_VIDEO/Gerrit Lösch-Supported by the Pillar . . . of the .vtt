Is the following statement true or false?

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truth is relative.”

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
That statement
is not relatively but absolutely false.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:17.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some think
that something is truth for one person

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not truth for another person.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:24.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many religious organizations
claim to have the truth.

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, between them
there are many contradicting teachings.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:34.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just another evidence
that all truth is relative

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that there is no absolute truth?

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is that truth is not relative;

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:44.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is absolute.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who say truth is relative

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not only relatively but absolutely wrong.

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hebrew word for “truth,” <i>ʼ</i><i>emeth</i><i>ʹ</i><i>,</i>

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:57.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
is often rendered “truth”

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may designate what is firm,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
trustworthy, stable, or faithful.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word for “truth,”
<i>a·le</i><i>ʹ</i><i>thei·a</i>,

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
originates with a word meaning
“not concealed,”

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the truth often involves the revealing

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
of that which was formerly hidden.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said according to Luke 12:2:

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:29.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But there is nothing carefully concealed
that will not be revealed,

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing secret
that will not become known.”

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are over 70 places
in the Gospel accounts

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jesus is said
to have used a unique expression

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:44.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
to emphasize the truthfulness of his words.

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:47.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would often say “Amen”

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:51.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
to introduce a sentence.

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:55.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
The corresponding Hebrew word
meant “certain, true.”

00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notes <i>The New International Dictionary</i>
<i>of New Testament Theology:</i>

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:05.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By introducing his words with amen

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus labelled them as certain and reliable.

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He stood by them and made them binding

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:15.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
on himself and his hearers.”

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The New International Dictionary </i>
<i>of New Testament Theology,</i>

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Volume 3, page 901, says:

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:30.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Many people try] to ‘unmask’ everything,

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the belief that no one and nothing

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:36.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“can genuinely lay claim to truth. . . .

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truth can indeed be found . . .

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[We need to display]
a humble submission to truth

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:45.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whenever and wherever it emerges.

00:02:45.648 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such openness to truth is required

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of those who worship the God of truth . . .

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reverence for truth ensures honesty

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a man’s dealings with his neighbour,

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“both in word and deed.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the attitude . . .
to which both the O[ld] T[estament]

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:09.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the N[ew] T[estament] bear witness.”

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:13.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the truth ever change?

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:18.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
That question was raised by V. R. Ruggiero

00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his book <i>The Art of Thinking</i>. 

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
His answer is no.

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:26.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
To quote him:

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It may sometimes seem to [that it changes],

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:33.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on closer inspection
it will be found not to.”

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the truth never changes!

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:42.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Consider,” he says,
“the case of the authorship

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the first book of the Bible,
the book of Genesis.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For centuries Christians and Jews alike

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:52.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
“believed that the book had a single author.

00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:55.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In time this view was challenged,

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and eventually replaced by the belief

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that as many as five authors
contributed to Genesis.

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:05.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then, in 1981,

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:10.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the results of a 5-year linguistic analysis
of Genesis

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were published,
stating that there is

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:17.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an 82 percent probability
of single authorship,

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:19.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as originally thought.

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:25.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Has the truth
about the authorship of Genesis changed?

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:26.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only our belief has changed.”

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:33.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also wrote:

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:38.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The truth will not be changed
by our knowledge or by our ignorance.”

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we agree.

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:45.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, no one really believes
that there is no truth.

00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:48.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to physical realities,

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:52.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as medicine, mathematics,
or the laws of physics,

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:57.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
all people believe that some things are true.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us would dare to ride in an airplane

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:02.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we didn’t believe
that the laws of aerodynamics

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
were absolute truths?

00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verifiable truths do exist.

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:11.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
They surround us,
and we stake our lives on them.

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the truth ever change?

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:19.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:22.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our understanding of truth changes

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we progress in understanding it,

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:28.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the truth never changes.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus said that our purpose in life
was to talk about the truth,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was speaking of something
that faithful Jews had valued

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
for centuries.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:44.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
In their sacred writings,
the Jews had long read of truth

00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:48.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something concrete, not theoretical.

00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:54.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible,
“truth” translates the Hebrew word <i>ʼ</i><i>emeth</i><i>ʹ</i><i>,</i>

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:58.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
which signifies that which is firm, solid

00:05:58.174 --> 00:06:03.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, perhaps most of all, reliable.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews had good reason
for viewing truth in that way.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:13.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
They called their God,
“Jehovah, the God of truth.”

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was because everything Jehovah said
he would do, he did.

00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:20.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he made promises, he kept them.

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he inspired prophecies,
they were fulfilled.

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:28.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he uttered final judgments,
they were carried out.

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:34.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Millions of Israelites
had been eyewitnesses of these realities.

00:06:34.744 --> 00:06:36.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspired writers of the Bible

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:41.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded them
as indisputable facts of history.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike other books viewed as sacred,

00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:48.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is not set
against a backdrop of myth or legend.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is firmly grounded in verifiable facts

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
—historical, archaeological, scientific,

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:03.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sociological realities.

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder the psalmist says to Jehovah:

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your law is truth. . . .

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All your commandments are truth. . . .

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
The very essence of your word is truth”!

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:20.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jehovah God is the Author of the Bible,

00:07:20.556 --> 00:07:23.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is truth.

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:26.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus Christ echoed the words of that psalm

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said in prayer to Jehovah:

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your word is truth.”

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew that everything his Father spoke

00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:39.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
was absolutely firm and reliable.

00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:44.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise,
Jesus himself was “full of . . . truth.”

00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, 
Jesus was even the personification of truth.

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:53.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Mosaic Law was truth.

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:56.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was not the full truth.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:08:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus taught something different
from the Mosaic Law.

00:08:00.263 --> 00:08:02.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible shows that the Mosaic Law

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:05.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a “shadow,” or prophetic picture,

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:10.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
of greater realities,
which came true through Christ.

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:13.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Mosaic Law was not the full truth

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:15.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a pattern of it.

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was not the shadow but the reality.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said at John 14:6:

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am . . . the truth.”

00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:32.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as far as teachings are concerned,
what is truth?

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:34.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helps us to understand it?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:39.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible speaks
of “the spirit of the truth.”

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the spirit of the truth”?

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:46.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the spirit
that proceeds from Jehovah God.

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is pure and holy.

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:53.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told his disciples at John 16:12, 13:

00:08:55.818 --> 00:08:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I still have many things to say to you,

00:08:58.287 --> 00:09:00.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but you are not able to bear them now.

00:09:00.923 --> 00:09:03.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when that one comes,

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:05.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the spirit of the truth,

00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:07.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he will guide you into all the truth,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for he will not speak of his own initiative,

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but what he hears he will speak,

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:15.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will declare to you

00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:17.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things to come.”

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:21.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit would teach them
everything they needed to know

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:23.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out their work,

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
recalling and opening up their understanding

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
to things
they had previously heard from Jesus

00:09:30.686 --> 00:09:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had not understood.

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit would also declare to them
the things coming,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the bringing to light

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:44.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
the significance
of Jesus’ death and resurrection,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
as these events were then yet future

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:48.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were among the things

00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his disciples did not understand
in the beginning.

00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:56.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Charles Taze Russell wrote the book

00:09:56.445 --> 00:09:59.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Divine Plan of the Ages</i>.

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was published in 1886.

00:10:03.219 --> 00:10:05.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
It included a discussion on

00:10:05.454 --> 00:10:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Bible as a Divine Revelation

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:10.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Viewed in the Light of Reason.”

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said:

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The depth and power and wisdom
and scope of the Bible’s testimony

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:22.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
convince us that not man,
but Almighty God, is the author.”

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
To appreciate the truth more,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what can we compare the truth?

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:36.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a mirror
that helps us to see the facts

00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, if necessary, to improve our looks.

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:45.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a pillar
—firm and supportive—

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it helps to combat false teachings.

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:53.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is also compared
to a girdle, or “belt,”

00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
that warriors used.

00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:58.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to continue with right conduct.

00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:02.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a rainbow for beauty.

00:11:03.713 --> 00:11:07.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is as beautiful
as the song of the nightingale.

00:11:08.117 --> 00:11:12.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a romantic bonfire for warmth

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a cold evening.

00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:18.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is an illustration
that many of you will like:

00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:21.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the first cup of coffee
in the morning,

00:11:21.497 --> 00:11:23.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
invigorating somebody.

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, truth is invigorating.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a magnet,

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
drawing honest-hearted ones to God.

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:36.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like an oasis in the desert.

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:40.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like an anchor in the stormy seas.

00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:44.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a lifeboat on a sinking ship.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a lighthouse in the night,

00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
guiding a boat safely to the shore or harbor.

00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a compass
showing sailors the way.

00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is also like a compass

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing the way out of a jungle
to a safe area.

00:12:03.873 --> 00:12:08.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the rising sun
bathing the landscape in warm light.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the display of fireworks
for beauty.

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:18.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the magnetic shield
around the earth,

00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:22.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
protecting it from deathly cosmic radiation.

00:12:24.627 --> 00:12:26.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like light.

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:31.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fruitage of the light
consists of every sort of . . . truth.”

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
He that “does what is true

00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:36.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes to the light,”
the Bible says.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:41.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine you were born blind
and received eyesight through an operation.

00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:44.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you be elated?

00:12:44.213 --> 00:12:49.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like that when somebody
comes to know and appreciate it.

00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:55.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like beautiful music
played solo or by an orchestra.

00:12:56.659 --> 00:13:00.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like the most delicious food
for taste and gives strength.

00:13:02.398 --> 00:13:05.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is what a nursing mother is
to her baby.

00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a hidden treasure;
we need to dig for it.

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:15.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like refreshing water on a hot day.

00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a mighty river.

00:13:19.448 --> 00:13:24.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you try to stop it with a dam,
it will overflow the dam.

00:13:24.286 --> 00:13:27.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can stop the truth.

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:28.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:32.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah, the Almighty,
is backing it up.

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:35.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a flower

00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:39.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even a bouquet
of beautiful little flowers.

00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:41.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Russell once wrote:

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truth, like a modest little flower

00:13:44.773 --> 00:13:46.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the wilderness of life,

00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:49.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is surrounded and <i>almost</i>  choked

00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:53.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the luxuriant growth
of the weeds of error.

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:56.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you would find it
you must be ever on the lookout.

00:13:56.552 --> 00:14:00.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you would see its beauty
you must brush aside the weeds of error

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:03.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the brambles of bigotry.

00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:08.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you would possess it
you must stoop to get it.

00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:13.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be not content with <i>one</i>  flower of truth.

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:18.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Had one been sufficient
there would have been no more.

00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:20.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gather ever, seek for more.”

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:25.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a fragrance, or perfume.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is like a sparkling diamond.

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you love diamonds?

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the truth’s value
is so much more than diamonds

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:37.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it brings Jehovah’s friendship

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leads to everlasting life.

00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:45.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is compared to a way on which we walk.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:49.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 2:2
speaks of “the way of the truth.”

00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘God is a Spirit,

00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:56.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who worship him
must do so with spirit and truth.’

00:14:58.047 --> 00:15:00.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to study the truth

00:15:00.282 --> 00:15:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attend Christian meetings
where the truth is taught.

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:07.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not miss congregation meetings.

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 3:15 compares the congregation

00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:15.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
with “a pillar . . . of the truth.”

00:15:15.297 --> 00:15:18.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation
preserves the purity of the truth

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:20.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and upholds it.

00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, Jehovah teaches us through the Bible

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also through Christian meetings.

00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also to speak the truth by preaching.

00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
We speak the truth also with one another.

00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:35.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the truth on our lips;

00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:38.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the truth around our hips.

00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:41.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 6:14 says

00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:45.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have “the belt of truth
fastened around [our] waist.”

00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:51.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is in utter confusion.

00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:55.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is to know the truth!

00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice in it!

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are ready to preach the truth
and teach the truth.

00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:06.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we talk the truth,
and we walk in the truth.

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:09.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 3 John 3, we read:

00:16:09.918 --> 00:16:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go on walking in the truth.”

00:16:13.022 --> 00:16:17.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who walk in the truth now
will walk forever.

00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:20.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micah 4:5 says:

00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:25.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all the peoples will walk,
each in the name of its god,

00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:28.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will walk
in the name of Jehovah our God

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
forever and ever.”

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:35.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is a long time!

00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your students to love the truth
and to live the truth

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, if necessary, to be willing
to die for the truth and for Jehovah.

00:16:46.522 --> 00:16:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is invincible
and will conquer this wicked world.

00:16:50.693 --> 00:16:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all,
including our relatives

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our Bible students,

00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:58.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
have the determination to walk in the truth

00:16:58.033 --> 00:17:00.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talk about the truth.

00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why shall we do this?

00:17:02.705 --> 00:17:07.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we love the truth
and we love the God of truth.

00:17:08.077 --> 00:17:12.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also to live the truth
by our Christian conduct.

00:17:12.147 --> 00:17:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, this is the truth!

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
His Word is truth.

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:21.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep talking the truth,
and keep walking in the truth.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:26.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will walk forever
and praise our loving God of truth!
