00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought it might be a truck driving by.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:30.134 line:10% position:50% align:center
When it happened again, we got up 

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
and started reading the news on the Internet,

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we found out that there were explosions
happening in all the cities.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:41.770 line:10% position:50% align:center
My mom awoke from her sleep

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.356 line:10% position:50% align:center
to sirens sounding all over the city.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:46.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
Of course, we were very anxious

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and turned on the TV immediately,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we didn’t even have
to look for information

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all the channels were already talking
about the fact that war had started.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:00.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just immediately
started praying to Jehovah,

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
calling friends and close ones
and asking how they were,

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:06.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waiting for guidance from the brothers.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.466 line:10% position:50% align:center
At 5:30 a.m.,

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.718 line:10% position:50% align:center
a brother from Kyiv called us

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.429 line:10% position:50% align:center
and said that the bombs were landing in Kyiv.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
We immediately got up, woke up the children,

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told them about the situation.

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we didn’t let the children go to school.

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:31.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realized that our lives had changed.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
We read the daily text, but I want to note

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.703 line:10% position:50% align:center
that this scripture is well-known for us.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
It used to be a yeartext

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:43.791 line:10% position:50% align:center
and, of course, we knew it.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.794 line:10% position:50% align:center
But at that moment, it sounded special.

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.338 line:10% position:50% align:center
I mean, it was like personal guidance,

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:50.923 line:10% position:50% align:center
such a personal answer

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah to everyone.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I understood what I had to do.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that day,
brothers created a Zoom meeting

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ran for the whole day.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
And brothers and sisters
could connect via Zoom to preach,

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:09.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to each other, and support each other.

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:11.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were all together.

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:15.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day it became more difficult.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
It became more difficult to deliver food,

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the food became more expensive.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
People started to panic,

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
which led to panic buying of medicines

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basic staple products.

00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:39.805 line:10% position:50% align:center
Yes, before that, during the pandemic,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.515 line:10% position:50% align:center
for two years now,

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:43.600 line:10% position:50% align:center
brothers had been constantly reminding us

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the necessity of go bags.

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, closer to the war,

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminders also began to come from brothers

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
about not only stocking up on such backpacks

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also about checking
what condition they were in.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was also recommended to stock up
on food for two months in advance.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:09.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the war started,
we were really frightened

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was
in my ninth month of pregnancy,

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I could go into labor at any moment.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayed a lot.

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to work out what to do next,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the right thing for us to do was.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t sure
what was going on or how it would end.

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we heard that next to us
they bombed a hospital

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they bombed a dormitory, we understood 

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:37.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to find a safer place.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was then that my husband
made the decision that we should go.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t leave
because I wasn’t able to travel.

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:52.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even to transport me
from one room to the other was a problem.

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:57.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the situation
really was such that in our case

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was very difficult to leave.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was very hard to stay

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
because almost every day
the area was being shelled.

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:10.187 line:10% position:50% align:center
My dad is

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:12.564 line:10% position:50% align:center
in quite a difficult condition right now.

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is completely blind with poor hearing;

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had a stroke
and broke his hip a few months ago.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now he is completely bedridden

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and requires constant care.

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:31.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Katya’s mom is hard of hearing,

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she broke her arm.

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:38.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our duty to take care of our parents.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a commandment that Jehovah gave,

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:45.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we did not know
how we could do it in this situation.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the war started,
in the first days of it,

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:53.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
my grandfather had a second stroke,

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:58.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worries about him
were added to the situation.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:03.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to take care of him
because he could not eat.

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:08.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only my mom, my older brother,
my grandmother, and I

00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:10.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
are Jehovah’s Witnesses in our family.

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad was worried about my safety.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understood that out of our whole family,
I was the only one who could leave.

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we left, my husband
called an elder from our congregation.

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:30.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and his wife were already
in the west of Ukraine at the time,

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:32.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they gave us a lot of advice.

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gave us advice
on how to behave at roadblocks,

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should hide our phones
and not take photos of anything.

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were advising us
on which villages to go through

00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:46.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there were
very big traffic jams at the time

00:05:46.742 --> 00:05:50.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people were stopped in some traffic jams
for 10 to 12 hours.

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were no lights.

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:58.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
We drove large sections
of the road in one go,

00:05:58.086 --> 00:06:01.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
constantly praying
that we wouldn’t get a flat tire,

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the car wouldn’t break down,

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:05.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we wouldn’t get stuck in a field.

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before each checkpoint, we were so nervous

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:18.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
because local militia
when drunk could be unpredictable,

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:23.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since they had weapons
—combat weapons—

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:27.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were afraid not only of the invaders

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
but of the locals as well.

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:35.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think we ever prayed
as much as we did

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:37.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
during those hours on the road.

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:40.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband tried to stay as calm as possible

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:44.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reassure me so that I wouldn’t worry.

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:51.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister found out
that there would be an evacuation train,

00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:55.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we kind of wanted to get on it;

00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:58.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were not sure that we would.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this time, with prayers,

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:04.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
she managed to organize the transportation

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:07.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and both our families went.

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:13.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was amazing that this train had a special
carriage for people with disabilities,

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were taken to this carriage,

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:20.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the train
was even delayed until we sat down.

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were waiting for us.

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:27.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we left, we informed the elders

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we had made up our minds
and that we were going.

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:34.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers sent us
a certain amount of money.

00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:37.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said, “This is to help you.”

00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:39.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we boarded the train,

00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:42.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
we found out
that we had to pay for the train,

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:46.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
although before that,
all evacuation trains were free.

00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:48.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told us the amount for the tickets,

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was exactly the same
as what the brothers had given us.

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:58.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only opportunity
for me to leave was by evacuation train.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:03.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually a compartment
is designed for 4 people;

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:05.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ours there were 13 of us.

00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:13.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the train, I was traveling
with a family from my congregation.

00:08:14.723 --> 00:08:19.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to reduce our worries
and switch to something positive,

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided to take the opportunity
and preach to the people.

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:27.944 line:10% position:50% align:center
We drove for 16 hours,

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:31.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we arrived very late.

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Lviv, a group of police approached

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took me
to the Security Service of Ukraine.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I have a Russian passport,

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:45.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am essentially like an enemy to them.

00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:51.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that Jehovah was with Dad,
that He would protect him,

00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:55.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that most likely
he would not be dragged there to prison

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:57.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
or something like that.

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:03.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I was worried that they might simply
not let us go further

00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we would stay in Ukraine.

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:11.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sat and waited.

00:09:11.238 --> 00:09:13.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:18.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this helped me
not to focus on my negative thoughts

00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:22.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to trust Jehovah completely.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to incite me
to say such slogans as

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:31.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Glory to Ukraine!”

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
I answered:
“I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:37.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we take a neutral position in this war.

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:40.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We do not support the Russian side,

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:44.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I also cannot glorify
some other country.”

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:51.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he told me to curse Putin.

00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:55.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Well, since I am a believer,

00:09:56.992 --> 00:10:01.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cannot speak swear words
so I cannot say this either.”

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:07.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the policeman said:
“Yes, I know your people.

00:10:07.502 --> 00:10:10.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t want to defend their homeland.”

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:13.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
I replied, “Well, if I were a conscript,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would fight against Ukraine now,
since I am Russian.”

00:10:17.137 --> 00:10:20.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Well, then save your family.

00:10:20.849 --> 00:10:22.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go with God, Alexsei!”

00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:28.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave me back my documents
and wished me a good journey.

00:10:28.732 --> 00:10:32.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
We waited at the border for about 17 hours.

00:10:33.737 --> 00:10:37.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
The difficulty was that it was very cold.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
The car got cold quickly,
and there were no toilets.

00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:43.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it was our turn to be checked,

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:46.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
we spoke to the female border guard
and explained to her

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:49.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could go into labor at any time

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:51.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I really needed my husband’s help

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I couldn’t even carry my own bag.

00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:58.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she told me that if I wanted,
I could stay in Ukraine,

00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:02.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there was no way
my husband would be allowed to leave.

00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:14.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our final destination
was the city of Chełm in Poland,

00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:16.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we arrived.

00:11:16.905 --> 00:11:19.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was an outburst of emotions

00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:22.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the volunteers
quickly brought us to the sisters

00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:25.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we saw the jw.org sign.

00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:27.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were so many emotions.

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:33.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is, well, it took our breath away,

00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:37.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we just couldn’t speak, and now, indeed,

00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:41.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was the moment
when we understood that this is it;

00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:43.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were saved!

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:49.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we arrived at the Kingdom Hall,

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:51.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were feeling really emotional.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very worried and nervous
about what was going to happen.

00:11:57.946 --> 00:12:02.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
But once we entered the Kingdom Hall,
we were able to calm down.

00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:06.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were a lot
of local brothers and sisters

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
who greeted us with hugs.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many even had tears in their eyes

00:12:11.001 --> 00:12:13.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they saw
that I was going to have a baby soon.

00:12:14.212 --> 00:12:18.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment, we realized
that Jehovah and our brotherhood

00:12:18.508 --> 00:12:21.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
will take care of us as their own family

00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:24.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
in whatever circumstances we find ourselves.

00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:30.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sat in the Kingdom Hall
and didn’t know what to plan next.

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:33.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elder who was on shift
at the Kingdom Hall

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:36.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
took time for me,
and he encouraged me very much.

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:40.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
He acknowledged everything
I had gone through and comforted me,

00:12:40.322 --> 00:12:42.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting me know that I was now safe.

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:45.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
He assured me that Jehovah is with me

00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:49.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will continue to support me
and that I have no reason to fear.

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:52.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember a moment

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I went outside in the evening

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the view of the Carpathian Mountains
opened up to me.

00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:00.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
The birds were singing.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthened me so much.

00:13:02.177 --> 00:13:04.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remembered the thought
where a brother said

00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if Jehovah created all of this,

00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:08.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t he help you?

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, well, later I felt that power on me

00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:15.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
when everything began to resolve so quickly,

00:13:15.482 --> 00:13:18.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t even think
that it would resolve that way.

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:22.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
My biggest fear
is probably the fear of the unknown,

00:13:24.783 --> 00:13:27.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now we see
that there is nothing to be afraid of.

00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:34.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a Disaster Relief Committee
that helped to accommodate refugees.

00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:38.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the sisters working with the committee

00:13:38.672 --> 00:13:42.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
were looking for routes
and looking for transport

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
—buses, trains, and planes.

00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:52.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were accommodated
with an amazing family

00:13:52.143 --> 00:13:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we felt really comfortable.

00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:58.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt completely understood.

00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:00.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is simply incredible.

00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:05.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah
has accompanied us all these years.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these years
we have been feeling his help,

00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:11.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now it is just like an avalanche

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an avalanche of miracles, help, and support.

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:20.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Different brothers and sisters
began to visit us straightaway,

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:23.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and each time there was someone new.

00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:25.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they always brought some bags or boxes.

00:14:27.762 --> 00:14:31.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the non-Witnesses,
it was like a miracle.

00:14:31.349 --> 00:14:33.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they kept asking:

00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:36.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do you know them?
Are these your relatives?”

00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No, we have never seen them before.”

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:41.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are they helping you?”

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it was such a good witness.

00:14:45.363 --> 00:14:49.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 24, exactly a month
after the war began,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniil and I
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

00:14:55.957 --> 00:15:00.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a great help
that a sister who could translate

00:15:00.336 --> 00:15:03.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
was present in the delivery room.

00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:05.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made me feel calmer.

00:15:08.803 --> 00:15:12.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
We try to speak
at every possible opportunity,

00:15:12.182 --> 00:15:15.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
sending each other text messages

00:15:15.477 --> 00:15:17.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and communicating via videoconferencing.

00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:23.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
I send Daniil videos and photos
of our little girl, Miroslava.

00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:29.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we constantly
reassure each other of our love

00:15:29.532 --> 00:15:32.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we appreciate each other very much.

00:15:36.998 --> 00:15:42.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feeling forced to move to another country
is very difficult.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
But thanks to Jehovah,
I have become convinced

00:15:47.592 --> 00:15:52.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his organization
really functions as one body.

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:58.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I am very happy to be part of it.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brotherhood

00:16:02.232 --> 00:16:05.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these are the people
waiting for you with open arms.

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt that

00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:16.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was Jehovah
who personally helped us.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is really evident that a lot of refugees
from Ukraine who come here

00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:24.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
are alone with their problems,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is very difficult for them.

00:16:28.508 --> 00:16:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much easier it is for us

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have
a friendly brotherhood with us!

00:16:33.888 --> 00:16:37.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although we are in a foreign country,
we feel at home.

00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:40.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
All thanks go to Jehovah!
