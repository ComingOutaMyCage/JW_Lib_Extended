00:00:24 We thought it might be a truck driving by.
00:00:27 When it happened again, we got up
00:00:30 and started reading the news on the Internet,
00:00:33 and we found out that there were explosions happening in all the cities.
00:00:39 My mom awoke from her sleep
00:00:41 to sirens sounding all over the city.
00:00:44 Of course, we were very anxious
00:00:46 and turned on the TV immediately,
00:00:49 but we didn’t even have to look for information
00:00:52 because all the channels were already talking about the fact that war had started.
00:00:57 We just immediately started praying to Jehovah,
00:01:00 calling friends and close ones and asking how they were,
00:01:04 and waiting for guidance from the brothers.
00:01:08 At 5:30 a.m.,
00:01:10 a brother from Kyiv called us
00:01:12 and said that the bombs were landing in Kyiv.
00:01:18 We immediately got up, woke up the children,
00:01:22 and told them about the situation.
00:01:24 And we didn’t let the children go to school.
00:01:27 We realized that our lives had changed.
00:01:33 We read the daily text, but I want to note
00:01:36 that this scripture is well-known for us.
00:01:39 It used to be a yeartext
00:01:41 and, of course, we knew it.
00:01:43 But at that moment, it sounded special.
00:01:46 I mean, it was like personal guidance,
00:01:49 such a personal answer
00:01:50 from Jehovah to everyone.
00:01:53 And I understood what I had to do.
00:01:56 And that day, brothers created a Zoom meeting
00:02:00 that ran for the whole day.
00:02:02 And brothers and sisters could connect via Zoom to preach,
00:02:06 talk to each other, and support each other.
00:02:09 We were all together.
00:02:13 Every day it became more difficult.
00:02:15 It became more difficult to deliver food,
00:02:19 and the food became more expensive.
00:02:23 People started to panic,
00:02:27 which led to panic buying of medicines
00:02:33 and basic staple products.
00:02:37 Yes, before that, during the pandemic,
00:02:39 for two years now,
00:02:41 brothers had been constantly reminding us
00:02:43 of the necessity of go bags.
00:02:46 And then, closer to the war,
00:02:49 reminders also began to come from brothers
00:02:51 about not only stocking up on such backpacks
00:02:54 but also about checking what condition they were in.
00:02:58 And it was also recommended to stock up on food for two months in advance.
00:03:05 When the war started, we were really frightened
00:03:09 because I was in my ninth month of pregnancy,
00:03:12 and I could go into labor at any moment.
00:03:15 We prayed a lot.
00:03:16 We wanted to work out what to do next,
00:03:19 what the right thing for us to do was.
00:03:22 We weren’t sure what was going on or how it would end.
00:03:26 But when we heard that next to us they bombed a hospital
00:03:30 and they bombed a dormitory, we understood
00:03:34 we had to find a safer place.
00:03:39 It was then that my husband made the decision that we should go.
00:03:44 We couldn’t leave because I wasn’t able to travel.
00:03:47 Even to transport me from one room to the other was a problem.
00:03:53 So the situation really was such that in our case
00:03:57 it was very difficult to leave.
00:04:00 And it was very hard to stay
00:04:02 because almost every day the area was being shelled.
00:04:08 My dad is
00:04:10 in quite a difficult condition right now.
00:04:13 He is completely blind with poor hearing;
00:04:16 he had a stroke and broke his hip a few months ago.
00:04:22 So now he is completely bedridden
00:04:25 and requires constant care.
00:04:28 Katya’s mom is hard of hearing,
00:04:31 and she broke her arm.
00:04:33 It is our duty to take care of our parents.
00:04:38 It is a commandment that Jehovah gave,
00:04:41 but we did not know how we could do it in this situation.
00:04:46 When the war started, in the first days of it,
00:04:50 my grandfather had a second stroke,
00:04:54 and worries about him were added to the situation.
00:04:59 We had to take care of him because he could not eat.
00:05:03 Only my mom, my older brother, my grandmother, and I
00:05:08 are Jehovah’s Witnesses in our family.
00:05:11 My dad was worried about my safety.
00:05:14 We understood that out of our whole family, I was the only one who could leave.
00:05:22 Before we left, my husband called an elder from our congregation.
00:05:27 He and his wife were already in the west of Ukraine at the time,
00:05:30 and they gave us a lot of advice.
00:05:33 They gave us advice on how to behave at roadblocks,
00:05:36 that we should hide our phones and not take photos of anything.
00:05:41 They were advising us on which villages to go through
00:05:44 because there were very big traffic jams at the time
00:05:46 and people were stopped in some traffic jams for 10 to 12 hours.
00:05:52 There were no lights.
00:05:54 We drove large sections of the road in one go,
00:05:58 constantly praying that we wouldn’t get a flat tire,
00:06:01 that the car wouldn’t break down,
00:06:03 and that we wouldn’t get stuck in a field.
00:06:07 Before each checkpoint, we were so nervous
00:06:14 because local militia when drunk could be unpredictable,
00:06:19 but since they had weapons —combat weapons—
00:06:24 we were afraid not only of the invaders
00:06:28 but of the locals as well.
00:06:32 I don’t think we ever prayed as much as we did
00:06:35 during those hours on the road.
00:06:37 My husband tried to stay as calm as possible
00:06:42 and reassure me so that I wouldn’t worry.
00:06:48 A sister found out that there would be an evacuation train,
00:06:52 and we kind of wanted to get on it;
00:06:56 but we were not sure that we would.
00:06:58 But this time, with prayers,
00:07:02 she managed to organize the transportation
00:07:04 and both our families went.
00:07:08 It was amazing that this train had a special carriage for people with disabilities,
00:07:14 and we were taken to this carriage,
00:07:17 and the train was even delayed until we sat down.
00:07:20 They were waiting for us.
00:07:24 Before we left, we informed the elders
00:07:27 that we had made up our minds and that we were going.
00:07:31 The brothers sent us a certain amount of money.
00:07:34 They said, “This is to help you.”
00:07:37 And when we boarded the train,
00:07:39 we found out that we had to pay for the train,
00:07:42 although before that, all evacuation trains were free.
00:07:46 They told us the amount for the tickets,
00:07:48 and it was exactly the same as what the brothers had given us.
00:07:54 The only opportunity for me to leave was by evacuation train.
00:07:59 Usually a compartment is designed for 4 people;
00:08:03 in ours there were 13 of us.
00:08:08 On the train, I was traveling with a family from my congregation.
00:08:14 In order to reduce our worries and switch to something positive,
00:08:19 we decided to take the opportunity and preach to the people.
00:08:25 We drove for 16 hours,
00:08:30 and we arrived very late.
00:08:33 In Lviv, a group of police approached
00:08:36 and took me to the Security Service of Ukraine.
00:08:40 Since I have a Russian passport,
00:08:43 I am essentially like an enemy to them.
00:08:47 I knew that Jehovah was with Dad, that He would protect him,
00:08:51 and that most likely he would not be dragged there to prison
00:08:55 or something like that.
00:08:59 But I was worried that they might simply not let us go further
00:09:03 and that we would stay in Ukraine.
00:09:09 I sat and waited.
00:09:11 I prayed to Jehovah.
00:09:14 And this helped me not to focus on my negative thoughts
00:09:20 but to trust Jehovah completely.
00:09:24 They began to incite me to say such slogans as
00:09:29 “Glory to Ukraine!”
00:09:32 I answered: “I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:09:35 “and we take a neutral position in this war.
00:09:37 “We do not support the Russian side,
00:09:41 but I also cannot glorify some other country.”
00:09:49 And then he told me to curse Putin.
00:09:51 I said, “Well, since I am a believer,
00:09:56 I cannot speak swear words so I cannot say this either.”
00:10:03 And the policeman said: “Yes, I know your people.
00:10:07 They don’t want to defend their homeland.”
00:10:10 I replied, “Well, if I were a conscript,
00:10:13 I would fight against Ukraine now, since I am Russian.”
00:10:17 He said: “Well, then save your family.
00:10:20 Go with God, Alexsei!”
00:10:24 He gave me back my documents and wished me a good journey.
00:10:28 We waited at the border for about 17 hours.
00:10:33 The difficulty was that it was very cold.
00:10:37 The car got cold quickly, and there were no toilets.
00:10:41 As it was our turn to be checked,
00:10:43 we spoke to the female border guard and explained to her
00:10:46 that I could go into labor at any time
00:10:49 and that I really needed my husband’s help
00:10:51 —I couldn’t even carry my own bag.
00:10:54 Then she told me that if I wanted, I could stay in Ukraine,
00:10:58 but there was no way my husband would be allowed to leave.
00:11:10 Our final destination was the city of Chełm in Poland,
00:11:14 where we arrived.
00:11:16 And there was an outburst of emotions
00:11:19 when the volunteers quickly brought us to the sisters
00:11:22 and we saw the jw.org sign.
00:11:25 There were so many emotions.
00:11:29 That is, well, it took our breath away,
00:11:33 and we just couldn’t speak, and now, indeed,
00:11:37 this was the moment when we understood that this is it;
00:11:41 we were saved!
00:11:46 When we arrived at the Kingdom Hall,
00:11:49 we were feeling really emotional.
00:11:54 We were very worried and nervous about what was going to happen.
00:11:57 But once we entered the Kingdom Hall, we were able to calm down.
00:12:04 There were a lot of local brothers and sisters
00:12:06 who greeted us with hugs.
00:12:08 Many even had tears in their eyes
00:12:11 when they saw that I was going to have a baby soon.
00:12:14 At that moment, we realized that Jehovah and our brotherhood
00:12:18 will take care of us as their own family
00:12:21 in whatever circumstances we find ourselves.
00:12:27 I sat in the Kingdom Hall and didn’t know what to plan next.
00:12:30 The elder who was on shift at the Kingdom Hall
00:12:33 took time for me, and he encouraged me very much.
00:12:36 He acknowledged everything I had gone through and comforted me,
00:12:40 letting me know that I was now safe.
00:12:42 He assured me that Jehovah is with me
00:12:45 and will continue to support me and that I have no reason to fear.
00:12:50 I remember a moment
00:12:52 when I went outside in the evening
00:12:53 and the view of the Carpathian Mountains opened up to me.
00:12:57 The birds were singing.
00:13:00 It strengthened me so much.
00:13:02 And I remembered the thought where a brother said
00:13:04 that if Jehovah created all of this,
00:13:06 won’t he help you?
00:13:10 And, well, later I felt that power on me
00:13:12 when everything began to resolve so quickly,
00:13:15 and I didn’t even think that it would resolve that way.
00:13:19 My biggest fear is probably the fear of the unknown,
00:13:24 but now we see that there is nothing to be afraid of.
00:13:29 There was a Disaster Relief Committee that helped to accommodate refugees.
00:13:36 And the sisters working with the committee
00:13:38 were looking for routes and looking for transport
00:13:42 —buses, trains, and planes.
00:13:48 We were accommodated with an amazing family
00:13:52 where we felt really comfortable.
00:13:55 We felt completely understood.
00:13:58 It is simply incredible.
00:14:00 Of course, Jehovah has accompanied us all these years.
00:14:05 All these years we have been feeling his help,
00:14:09 but now it is just like an avalanche
00:14:11 —an avalanche of miracles, help, and support.
00:14:16 Different brothers and sisters began to visit us straightaway,
00:14:20 and each time there was someone new.
00:14:23 And they always brought some bags or boxes.
00:14:27 And for the non-Witnesses, it was like a miracle.
00:14:31 And they kept asking:
00:14:33 “Do you know them? Are these your relatives?”
00:14:36 “No, we have never seen them before.”
00:14:39 “Why are they helping you?”
00:14:41 Oh, it was such a good witness.
00:14:45 On March 24, exactly a month after the war began,
00:14:50 Daniil and I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.
00:14:55 It was a great help that a sister who could translate
00:15:00 was present in the delivery room.
00:15:03 This made me feel calmer.
00:15:08 We try to speak at every possible opportunity,
00:15:12 sending each other text messages
00:15:15 and communicating via videoconferencing.
00:15:18 I send Daniil videos and photos of our little girl, Miroslava.
00:15:26 And we constantly reassure each other of our love
00:15:29 and that we appreciate each other very much.
00:15:36 Feeling forced to move to another country is very difficult.
00:15:43 But thanks to Jehovah, I have become convinced
00:15:47 that his organization really functions as one body.
00:15:55 And I am very happy to be part of it.
00:16:00 The brotherhood
00:16:02 —these are the people waiting for you with open arms.
00:16:07 We felt that
00:16:11 it was Jehovah who personally helped us.
00:16:17 It is really evident that a lot of refugees from Ukraine who come here
00:16:22 are alone with their problems,
00:16:26 and it is very difficult for them.
00:16:28 How much easier it is for us
00:16:31 because we have a friendly brotherhood with us!
00:16:33 And although we are in a foreign country, we feel at home.
00:16:37 All thanks go to Jehovah!
