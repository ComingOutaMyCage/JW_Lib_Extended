00:00:01 Hello.
00:00:02 I’m happy to invite you to a special event
00:00:04 that will be attended by millions of people.
00:00:07 It’s the anniversary of Jesus’ death.
00:00:10 This invitation shows the time
00:00:12 and location of the event in our area.
00:00:15 We also invite you to a special talk the weekend before.
00:00:24 Thanks.
00:00:26 Hmm.
00:00:27 The meetings are free?
00:00:29 Yes.
00:00:31 May I show you this minute-and-a-half video
00:00:33 that explains the significance of this meeting?
00:00:36 Sure.
00:00:39 Imagine a world filled with peace,
00:00:44 free of suffering,
00:00:47 an abundance of food for all,
00:00:50 and life in perfect health.
00:00:57 But how can this beautiful future be possible?
00:01:02 Because of what Jesus did for us.
00:01:07 He came to earth for a purpose.
00:01:12 He gave his life for those he loved.
00:01:18 The night before he died,
00:01:20 Jesus asked that we commemorate his sacrifice.
00:01:25 He said:
00:01:27 “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”
00:01:33 On the anniversary of his death,
00:01:35 people around the world will gather to remember him.
00:01:40 Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you and your family
00:01:43 to attend the Memorial of Jesus’ death.
00:01:46 At that meeting, you will find out
00:01:49 why his sacrifice was so important
00:01:52 and how his promises affect you.

00:01:59 on this and many other topics,

00:02:13 I hope you can come.
00:02:16 Thanks.
00:02:17 I need to check with my family,
00:02:19 but maybe you’ll see me there.
00:02:21 My name is Ed.
00:02:23 I’m Pete.
00:02:24 Perhaps the next time we talk,
00:02:26 I can show you what the Bible says about why Jesus died.
00:02:29 Is this normally a good time for you?
