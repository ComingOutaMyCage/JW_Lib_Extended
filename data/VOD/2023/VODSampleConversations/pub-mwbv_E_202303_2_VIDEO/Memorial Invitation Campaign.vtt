I’m happy to invite you to a special event

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be attended by millions of people.

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the anniversary of Jesus’ death.

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
This invitation shows the time

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and location of the event in our area.

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:19.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also invite you
to a special talk the weekend before.

00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:26.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:27.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:29.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
The meetings are free?

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:31.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:33.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
May I show you
this minute-and-a-half video

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
that explains
the significance of this meeting?

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:37.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:43.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a world filled with peace,

00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:46.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
free of suffering,

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:50.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
an abundance of food for all,

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:54.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and life in perfect health.

00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:01.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can this beautiful future
be possible?

00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:05.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of what Jesus did for us.

00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:10.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
He came to earth for a purpose.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:16.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave his life for those he loved.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:20.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
The night before he died,

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus asked
that we commemorate his sacrifice.

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:27.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:30.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the anniversary of his death,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
people around the world
will gather to remember him.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:43.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
invite you and your family

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:45.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the Memorial of Jesus’ death.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that meeting, you will find out

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:52.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
why his sacrifice was so important

00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how his promises affect you.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
To learn more about what the Bible says

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:02.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this and many other topics,

00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:05.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to jw.org.

00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:15.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you can come.

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:19.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to check with my family,

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:21.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maybe you’ll see me there.

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:23.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Ed.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m Pete.

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:26.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps the next time we talk,

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:29.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can show you what the Bible says
about why Jesus died.

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this normally a good time for you?
