00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which has greater appeal

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:07.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an effective counselor or a loving shepherd?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re to be effective,
brothers and sisters,

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
in strengthening the organization
and building up the brotherhood,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a good subject to consider.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it includes you sisters too.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:25.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
A counselor can be defined
as one who gives advice.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the world has a lot of counselors.

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve got marriage counselors
and financial counselors

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bereavement counselors
and all kinds of counselors.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:39.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll find that their counsel varies

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to their experience and education.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahithophel
is a Biblical example of a counselor,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible says what he advised

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
was “considered as the word of the true God.”

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, a person might feel
that he’s a good counselor,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he may freely offer advice,

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:02.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of which

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
may or may not be accepted.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe a solution-oriented husband

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
counsels his emotionally distraught wife

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:20.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just quit worrying.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or a well-versed elder
quickly reads a Bible text,

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he advises
an extremely anxiety-filled publisher

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just get over it.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:33.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
How effective is such counsel?

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:38.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a saying,
People don’t care how much you know

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they know how much you care.

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Counsel is more effective
when the counselor is also a shepherd.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:52.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
A shepherd is one
who comforts, nourishes, listens,

00:01:52.174 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and does not ignore
the emotional needs of the distraught one.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives counsel, or advice,
but he always does more.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:05.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, he also shepherds.

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he counsels,

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
he tends to the person’s emotional needs

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he provides the needed follow-up.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider how he dealt

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an emotionally depressed prophet

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the name of Elijah.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m turning to 1 Kings 19,

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to consider just briefly

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
the interaction he had with Elijah.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you will recall
that he was driven by fear.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:38.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah was driven by fear of Jezebel.

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah fled southward

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 95 miles (150 km) to Beer-sheba,

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:48.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he walked for about another
200 miles (320 km) to Mount Horeb.

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now notice in verse 5, it says:

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he [that is, Elijah]

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“lay down and fell asleep
under the broom tree.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:03.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But suddenly an angel
touched him and said to him:

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Get up and eat.’

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:09.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he looked, there at his head
was a round loaf on heated stones

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:11.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a jug of water.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He ate and drank and lay down again.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:19.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Later the angel of Jehovah
came back a second time

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and touched him and said:

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Get up and eat,
for the journey will be too much for you.’

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he got up and ate and drank,

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in the strength of that nourishment

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he went on for 40 days and 40 nights

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
until he reached Horeb,
the mountain of the true God.”

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice,

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:47.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angel awakened Elijah;

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
ministered to him;

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:55.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Elijah went back to sleep,
like depressed ones often do.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:57.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe the angel waited all night

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he touched Elijah again

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:04.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then gave him more nourishment

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nourishment that would take him
40 days and 40 nights

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his journey to Mount Horeb.

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:15.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a question
you have to ask yourself:

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that that angel agreed

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the way Elijah was acting?

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:27.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think the angel
might have wanted to give a little counsel

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tell Elijah:
“Look, Elijah, just get over it.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:37.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just trust God
and get back to your assignment”?

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:40.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he didn’t.

00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think Jehovah
knew how Elijah was thinking?

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think he agreed with it?

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, definitely not.

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, a counselor may have handled it one way,

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:55.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah
—“the God of all comfort”—

00:04:55.566 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
would first address Elijah’s emotional needs.

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:05.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when Elijah finally entered
the cave at Mount Horeb,

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:07.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you remember what Jehovah did?

00:05:08.537 --> 00:05:12.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a calm, low, gentle voice,

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: ‘Eijah, what is your business here?’

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:20.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was a warm invitation
for Elijah to express himself.

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:23.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Just talk to me,’ you see.

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Elijah did.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 10,
and see what it was that Elijah said.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I have been absolutely zealous
for Jehovah the God of armies;

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:36.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the people of Israel
have forsaken your covenant.”

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elijah felt like his work was in vain.

00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:42.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he said: “I’m the only one left.”

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:44.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah felt alone.

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:49.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said: “They are seeking
to take [me away, take] my life away.”

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elijah was also afraid.

00:05:52.497 --> 00:05:54.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah heard what he said,

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he addressed all of Elijah’s concerns.

00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then afterward,

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gave Elijah the encouragement

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow him
to continue on in Jehovah’s service

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
with boldness.

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we learn
from this brief experience?

00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:16.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we learned that Jehovah
validated the man’s emotions

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
without agreeing with his thinking.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:23.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we also learned
that it’s often not necessary

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:25.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer a quick solution.

00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:28.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply allowing a person
to express themselves

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
without feeling judged

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:34.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
can bring tremendous relief.

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, friends,

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:41.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
being heard is so close to being loved

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:44.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
that for the average person,
it’s indistinguishable.

00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:51.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jehovah, we’ll be more effective
if we’re patient shepherds that listen

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:53.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give thoughtful consideration

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:56.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the feelings of those
that we’re seeking to help.

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here are four takeaway points, OK?

00:07:01.817 --> 00:07:03.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be a listener, not a lecturer.

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show empathy.

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:14.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember,
empathy is seeing with the eyes of another,

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
hearing with the ears of another,

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feeling with the heart of another.

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:23.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easy, friends, for imperfect humans

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take themselves too seriously,

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:30.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when they’re given
a position of responsibility.

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:33.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at times

00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:38.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may even be best to refrain
from offering counsel too soon

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that creates an air of superiority.

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:47.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Conversely, a willingness to hear

00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:50.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
even “wild talk” from another

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:53.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reveal the depth of our own humility.

00:07:54.828 --> 00:07:56.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point number two:

00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:01.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Validate people’s emotions,
and don’t just dismiss them.

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:03.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feelings are real,

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:08.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
so know the difference between
validating and invalidating statements.

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:11.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can see why you would feel that way.

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:14.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
That must be really hard.”

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:17.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, when we listen with empathy,

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’re really saying is:

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:21.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You matter to me.

00:08:23.857 --> 00:08:27.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re important, and I care how you feel.”

00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:31.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally,
when you validate the other person,

00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:34.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
they become significantly more likely

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:37.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen to advice or counsel later.

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, there is a difference between—

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:45.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the way, let me just say this:

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:52.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Counsel is not necessarily good
just because it’s accurate.

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:57.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frankly, how you give it
and when you give it is important.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
So try to remember that.

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:01.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because it’s accurate,
doesn’t make it good.

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:06.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a difference too between
validating and devastating.

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:11.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know, you’re too sensitive.”

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:13.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What’s the big deal?”

00:09:13.657 --> 00:09:15.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t want to hear it.”

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:17.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t have time for this.”

00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:20.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You need to work on your spirituality.”

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, although we may not mean it,

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:29.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
this can translate into:
“You’re not important.

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:31.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your feelings aren’t important.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And frankly, I don’t really care.”

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:36.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point number three:

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:39.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acknowledge a vulnerability.

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:43.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing personal thoughts
and emotions can be difficult,

00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:45.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
uncomfortable, and even scary.

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:51.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I think that we’re encouraged
 to develop fellow feeling.

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:54.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, point number four:

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:57.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offering counsel is entirely optional.

00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:00.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many of us, brothers,
have been on a shepherding call,

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:02.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve said virtually nothing?

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:07.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the publisher, the brother or sister,
afterward says:

00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know what?

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:10.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the best
shepherding call I ever had.”

00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:16.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what some may need
is not some solution for the problem

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:18.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
but simply to talk to a good listener

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:22.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone who will not tell them
how they’re supposed to feel,

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:25.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will listen without being judgmental.

00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:30.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
The saying is, friends, Time is life.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we won’t give a brother our time,

00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:37.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you really think
we would give our life for him?

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:42.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we ‘show favor to the lowly one’
by giving him time and attention,

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:44.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are, in fact, “lending to Jehovah.”

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:49.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Bible says
that “he will repay” us in our time of need.

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:53.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
So weave counsel and shepherding together,

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:57.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ll be treasured by all those
around you and, most of all,

00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:59.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.
