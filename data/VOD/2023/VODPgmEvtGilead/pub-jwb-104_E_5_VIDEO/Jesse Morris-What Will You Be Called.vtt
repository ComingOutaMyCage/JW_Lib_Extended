00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:05.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest honor anyone can have

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to be called a servant
of the Most High God, Jehovah.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you’ve seen
from your deep study of God’s Word,

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
servants of Jehovah also have
distinct personality traits, or qualities,

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are called to mind
when their names are mentioned.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, what qualities, or traits,

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you think of
when we mention the following names?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ruth, Gideon,

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
David, Martha

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, the name of a servant of Jehovah

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
can call to mind
certain qualities, certain traits,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are worthy of imitation.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will you be called?

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you begin your new assignment,

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
what quality, or trait, would you like
your fellow workers to think about

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
when your name is mentioned?

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Proverbs provides

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
a very reachable goal in this regard.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open to Proverbs chapter 16,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read together verse 21.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Proverbs 16:21:

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wise in heart
will be called understanding.”

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a worthy goal that is

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be called a person of understanding!

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, from your studies,
you know understanding

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:40.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the ability to put the facts together

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to grasp the full,
complete picture of a matter.

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how is understanding demonstrated?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it revealed in a test score?

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it revealed
by being the first to provide a solution

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a group setting or perhaps at a meeting?

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s keep reading verse 21:

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the one kind in speech
adds persuasiveness.”

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s how understanding is demonstrated:

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
in kind speech or, as the footnote indicates,

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appealing speech,” “sweetness of lips.”

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a person who’s called understanding
puts the facts together,

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
grasps the full picture

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to find good in a matter.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is reflected through kind,

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
positive, persuasive speech.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is more than just being optimistic

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the power of positive thinking.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:50.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding has a source.

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Proverbs,
this time chapter 9,

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verse 10.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Proverbs 9:10:

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fear of Jehovah
is the beginning of wisdom,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and knowledge of the Most Holy One
is understanding.”

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is the Source

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:15.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“the Most Holy One,” Jehovah God.

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:18.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s both the Source of understanding,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s the supreme example
in how to use it.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:27.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think for a moment
of what happened after the tragic,

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:30.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
painful rebellion in the garden of Eden.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately, he put the facts together;
he saw the complete picture.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he uttered the Edenic promise

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a positive promise—
that gives us hope,

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:46.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
even right after that painful tragedy.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And hundreds of years later
with the nation of Israel,

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:54.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would repeatedly abandon Jehovah.

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would he do?

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:58.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would hear their groanings,

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would hear their cries,
he would see their changed attitude,

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:04.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would raise up judges

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save them time after time.

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah God shows us

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
what real understanding is.

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because we trust in him,

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
we too can find the good,

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:22.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
speak and act kindly and positively.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how refreshing it is
to see this in your class!

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your kind, positive speech and actions
with one another

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with those that you come in contact with

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been very refreshing to see.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a result
of your deep trust in God’s Word

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your deep trust in Jehovah himself.

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:45.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
And your studies
have just further enhanced that

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
over these past few months.

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, much of the world’s education

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
fosters critical thinking.

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what <i>The Watchtower </i> says about this:

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:59.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be fooled by the mistaken notion

00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that a cynical, critical,
pessimistic attitude

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the same as intelligence.

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, negative thinking
demands little of the intellect.”

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what a privilege to know,
as you dear students do,

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:18.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
what real understanding is!

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:21.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not just the ability
to identify what’s wrong with a situation.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the ability
to identify how good can address it.

00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:30.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this will encourage
your brothers and sisters.

00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:34.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Bethel family member
observed understanding

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the assistant overseer of a department.

00:05:36.982 --> 00:05:39.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion, the department overseer

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:41.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
scheduled a meeting with several brothers

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:44.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other departments,
but he forgot to inform his assistant.

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:50.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then on the day of the meeting,
the overseer was away.

00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:54.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
So several brothers arrived for a meeting

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:56.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the assistant knew nothing about.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would he do?

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:02.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was observed
that he said a brief, silent prayer;

00:06:02.507 --> 00:06:05.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
came out;
welcomed the group;

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
addressed the points for discussion;
and at the end said:

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:09.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you brothers
for coming to this meeting

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and allowing me to fill in for the overseer.

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:14.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ll update him when he returns.”

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:17.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just covered for him
—beautiful example.

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:20.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew this man
had shouldered responsibility for decades.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:22.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not his pattern.

00:06:22.194 --> 00:06:23.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he just applied the good.

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:26.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed understanding.

00:06:26.448 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, realistically,
there will be days when it will be hard

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:34.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be known as a person of understanding.

00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:37.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if, though,
there’s a prolonged period of time

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:41.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we’re finding it
difficult to find the good,

00:06:41.588 --> 00:06:45.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak and act kindly and positively?

00:06:45.717 --> 00:06:49.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe our mate or a trusted friend
even speaks with us and says,

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:54.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your kind, positive speech
and actions are changing.”

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:57.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do?

00:06:58.063 --> 00:07:01.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, each person and their relationship
with Jehovah is unique.

00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:06.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s consider the example
of the writer of Psalm 73

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learn a valuable principle.

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:11.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer of this inspired psalm
was struggling

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:14.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
with even whether or not to serve Jehovah.

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:16.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the turmoil he’s in

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 73:14:

00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:25.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I was troubled all day long;

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:29.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
every morning I was chastised.”

00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:32.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it can be difficult

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be known as a person of understanding
when we’re in this frame of mind.

00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in verse 22,
the psalmist honestly admits:

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:44.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was unreasoning and lacked understanding.”

00:07:44.109 --> 00:07:46.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would he do?

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could he ever be called understanding again?

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 15:

00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:56.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But if I had said these things,

00:07:56.913 --> 00:07:59.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would have betrayed your people.”

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first, the psalmist held back

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
from making his perplexing thoughts public.

00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:10.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that that kind of negative speech
would affect God’s people.

00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:12.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
He likened it to a betrayal,

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:16.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if he were releasing the names
of his fellow worshippers to the enemy.

00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:20.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he likened negative speech to.

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:24.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he kept
to his spiritual routine and waited.

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:31.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then a powerful moment
took place in verse 26:

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:37.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My body and my heart may fail,

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:41.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but God is the rock of my heart

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:44.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my portion forever.”

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:49.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is—understanding.

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:54.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist knew he was not alone.

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:57.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God, the immovable Rock,

00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:02.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
was keeping him stable
in the midst of this violent windstorm

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:05.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he found himself in.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:10.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
That powerful realization plugged him back
into the Source of understanding,

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was once again able
to put the facts together,

00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:16.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
find good in a matter,

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speak and act kindly and positively.

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:23.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are in turmoil
and feel lacking in understanding,

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:30.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are in good company.

00:09:30.298 --> 00:09:33.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many faithful servants of Jehovah
have felt this way.

00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:36.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do like the psalmist,

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:40.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hold back from negative speech,
which can affect those around us.

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we speak privately
with a trusted friend,

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:48.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
we keep to our spiritual routine,
and we wait.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wait for our powerful moment

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:56.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the realization that Jehovah God

00:09:56.783 --> 00:09:59.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the Rock of our heart.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:05.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one final point:
Demonstrating understanding

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
includes demonstrating it with ourself.

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:13.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will make mistakes, and when you do,

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
your trust in Jehovah

00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:19.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
will allow you to find the good in yourself,

00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:22.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Brother Sanderson mentioned
in the opening comments.

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:27.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that will help you
to keep a positive frame of mind.

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:31.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know Jehovah God
is going to be with you in your assignments.

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:34.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
May your trust in him
—the Source of understanding—

00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:37.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to deepen.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will allow you to address situations
by putting the facts together,

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:44.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
finding good in a matter,

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:48.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speaking and acting kindly,
positively, persuasively.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you do this,
you’ll be showing that you are wise in heart

00:10:53.423 --> 00:10:57.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will be called understanding.
