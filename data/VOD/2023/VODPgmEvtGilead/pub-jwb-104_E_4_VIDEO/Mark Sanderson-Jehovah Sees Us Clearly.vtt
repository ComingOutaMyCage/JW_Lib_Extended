00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:05.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, would some power the gift give us

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to see ourselves as others see us!

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would from many a blunder free us.”

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that famous quote
from the Scottish poet Robert Burns

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
acknowledges that it is impossible

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always see ourselves as others do.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s why we need training.

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need advice.

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need counsel
to help us to improve

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to work on certain flaws

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps we just can’t see in ourselves.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what a wonderful opportunity
you students at Gilead have had

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive focused spiritual training

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:57.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
from brothers who truly love you!

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, no doubt you’ve come
to see yourself more clearly

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you have ever seen yourself before.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, that quote from Robert Burns

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be understood in a different way too.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, maybe what we
cannot see clearly in ourselves

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:21.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all of the good qualities that we possess

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the potential that we have

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be used by Jehovah in his service.

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Samuel 16:7 says:

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in seeing into your heart,

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw fit to draw you

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a dedicated relationship with him.

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:50.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since then, he’s entrusted you

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
with various assignments in his service.

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why?
Why did Jehovah do that?

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does he see in you?

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:02.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
What qualities
and what spiritual qualifications

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
does he observe?

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can’t know
all that Jehovah sees in you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we cannot see ourselves
as Jehovah sees us.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s probably why
so many of God’s servants in Bible times

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:23.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
were reluctant
to accept challenging assignments.

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:27.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just think of some examples of this

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
—people who did not see
the fine qualities in themselves

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah could see.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, take Gideon.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in Judges chapter 6, let’s look at this.

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:42.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Judges 6:14,

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Jehovah said to Gideon.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Go with the strength you have,

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will save Israel
out of Midian’s hand.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it not I who send you?”

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how did Gideon react?

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 15, Gideon said:

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pardon me, Jehovah.
How can I save Israel?

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look!
My clan is the least in Manasseh,

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am the most insignificant
in my father’s house.”

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously, Gideon

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not see himself as Jehovah saw him.

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Moses?

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Exodus chapter 4,

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah assigned him
to lead Israel out of Egypt,

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses was keenly aware
of all of his inadequacies.

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when talking with Jehovah,

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:40.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
he raised one objection after another.

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:46.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was Jehovah aware
of the inadequacies that Moses had?

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:49.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course!
Of course he was!

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also knew
that Moses’ brother, Aaron, was older

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was a better speaker.

00:03:56.048 --> 00:04:01.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah saw in Moses qualities of faith,

00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
unselfishness, and meekness

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:07.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities that made Moses

00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right choice for the job.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Jeremiah?

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:16.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah commissioned him to serve
as a prophet, do you remember what he said?

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:18.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at it.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:20.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 1

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jeremiah chapter 1—

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look at verse 6.

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:29.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah says:

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:31.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:36.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not know how to speak,
for I am just a boy.”

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Jehovah say?

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh. OK. OK, Jeremiah,
I’ll see if I can find someone else.’

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:43.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:45.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 7:

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah then said to me:
‘Do not say, “I am just a boy.”

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:54.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For you must go to all those
to whom I send you,

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you should say everything
that I command you.’”

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:02.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Jehovah so confident

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:07.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jeremiah was the right choice
for this special assignment?

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, if you look in verse 8,

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:13.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said: “I am with you.”

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, that’s the same thing
that Jehovah said to Gideon;

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s the same thing he said to Moses.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
because Jehovah was with them,

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be successful.

00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:25.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s another reason too.

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see what it says in verse 5?

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:30.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said to Jeremiah:

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:34.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before I formed you in the womb

00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:39.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I knew [isn’t that interesting? I knew] you,

00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:42.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and before you were born I sanctified you.

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:45.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made you a prophet to the nations.”

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:49.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew Jeremiah.

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:51.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw in Jeremiah certain qualities

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:56.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would make him an effective prophet
with Jehovah’s help.

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, could Jeremiah see that in himself?

00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:02.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just had to trust in Jehovah’s assessment,

00:06:05.928 --> 00:06:10.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
move forward,
and do what Jehovah asked him to do.

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:15.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have wonderful examples of this
in our modern day too.

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:19.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother John Booth
was a faithful, humble brother.

00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:23.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
He started in full-time service in 1928.

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:26.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 1935,

00:06:26.448 --> 00:06:30.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was called to work
at the factory at Bethel.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, just after working for a few days,

00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:37.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was very surprised
when Brother Knorr invited him

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:40.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go on the road
as a regional service director,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we would perhaps call
a circuit overseer today.

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:47.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr explained
there was a great need

00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:49.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Brother Booth could be a big help

00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:53.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his experience as a pioneer.

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Brother Booth replied

00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:58.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had never had
a position in the congregation.

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had never given a talk.
Can you imagine?

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:05.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had no training to do so.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s what Brother Knorr said:

00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:12.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Eloquent speakers are not what is needed,

00:07:12.202 --> 00:07:16.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just someone who loves the service
and will take the lead in it

00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:21.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will talk about service at the meetings.”

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Booth said:
“With misgivings, doubts, and fears,

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wanting to do Jehovah’s will,
I agreed to try it.”

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:33.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did it turn out?

00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:35.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Booth moved forward.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:39.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spent his whole life in full-time service,

00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:42.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
later serving for more than 20 years

00:07:42.607 --> 00:07:44.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a member of the Governing Body.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:47.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he finished his earthly course,

00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:49.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> stated:

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:53.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[He] was beloved
for his profoundly humble

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:56.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind Christian personality.”

00:07:56.997 --> 00:08:01.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, Jehovah saw something good

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:04.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Brother John Booth.

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from these examples?

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:11.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Gideon and Moses
and Jeremiah and Brother Booth,

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:15.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might feel inadequate 
for certain assignments.

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:20.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s good that we’re not overconfident
or too self-reliant.

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:24.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we don’t want to go
to the other extreme either.

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:26.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you see, we could begin to think:

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:31.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I could never be a pioneer.
I could never be a ministerial servant.

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:34.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I could never be an elder.
I could never be a Bethelite.

00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:39.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could never be a construction servant,’
and on and on and on.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re given one of those assignments
or some other one,

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:45.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could even hesitate to accept

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:47.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
—give in to fear.

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:52.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact is that we
cannot fully see ourselves

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:55.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah does.

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:58.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much better to make ourselves available

00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:02.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then move forward with the work
that we’re given to do,

00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:07.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking to Jehovah to make up 
for whatever we may lack!

00:09:08.068 --> 00:09:11.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, you students,
who are soon-to-be graduates,

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:15.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
will no doubt have a variety of assignments

00:09:15.283 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the coming years.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:19.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever those assignments are,

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:24.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
move forward with full confidence in Jehovah.

00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:26.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be with you.

00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:30.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll give you everything that you need
to be successful

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:32.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
in accomplishing the work.

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:35.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the question:

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:39.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?

00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:44.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps to some extent, yes,
but not completely.

00:09:44.187 --> 00:09:48.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be ready to listen to counsel

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to make adjustments.

00:09:50.652 --> 00:09:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
But also, when your good qualities

00:09:54.614 --> 00:09:57.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your good potential are noticed

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you receive new assignments,

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:05.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
grab hold and move forward.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may our wonderful God, Jehovah,

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:12.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
always be with you
and bless you as you do so.
