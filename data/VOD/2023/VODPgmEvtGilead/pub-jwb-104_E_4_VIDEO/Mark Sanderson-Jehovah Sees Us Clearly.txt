00:00:01 “Oh, would some power the gift give us
00:00:05 “to see ourselves as others see us!
00:00:10 It would from many a blunder free us.”
00:00:15 Well, that famous quote from the Scottish poet Robert Burns
00:00:20 acknowledges that it is impossible
00:00:23 to always see ourselves as others do.
00:00:28 Well, that’s why we need training.
00:00:30 That’s why we need advice.
00:00:32 That’s why we need counsel to help us to improve
00:00:36 and to work on certain flaws
00:00:38 that perhaps we just can’t see in ourselves.
00:00:43 Well, what a wonderful opportunity you students at Gilead have had
00:00:48 to receive focused spiritual training
00:00:53 from brothers who truly love you!
00:00:57 And now, no doubt you’ve come to see yourself more clearly
00:01:02 than you have ever seen yourself before.
00:01:06 But, you know, that quote from Robert Burns
00:01:09 can be understood in a different way too.
00:01:13 See, maybe what we cannot see clearly in ourselves
00:01:17 are all of the good qualities that we possess
00:01:21 or the potential that we have
00:01:24 to be used by Jehovah in his service.
00:01:28 First Samuel 16:7 says:
00:01:31 “Man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:01:34 but Jehovah sees into the heart.”
00:01:39 Well, in seeing into your heart,
00:01:41 Jehovah saw fit to draw you
00:01:44 into a dedicated relationship with him.
00:01:47 And since then, he’s entrusted you
00:01:50 with various assignments in his service.
00:01:52 Now, why? Why did Jehovah do that?
00:01:55 What does he see in you?
00:01:59 What qualities and what spiritual qualifications
00:02:02 does he observe?
00:02:04 Well, we can’t know all that Jehovah sees in you
00:02:09 because we cannot see ourselves as Jehovah sees us.
00:02:13 That’s probably why so many of God’s servants in Bible times
00:02:18 were reluctant to accept challenging assignments.
00:02:23 Now, just think of some examples of this
00:02:27 —people who did not see the fine qualities in themselves
00:02:32 that Jehovah could see.
00:02:34 For example, take Gideon.
00:02:36 Now, in Judges chapter 6, let’s look at this.
00:02:39 At Judges 6:14,
00:02:45 notice what Jehovah said to Gideon.
00:02:50 He said: “Go with the strength you have,
00:02:52 “and you will save Israel out of Midian’s hand.
00:02:56 Is it not I who send you?”
00:02:58 But now, how did Gideon react?
00:03:00 In verse 15, Gideon said:
00:03:04 “Pardon me, Jehovah. How can I save Israel?
00:03:07 “Look! My clan is the least in Manasseh,
00:03:10 and I am the most insignificant in my father’s house.”
00:03:15 Well, obviously, Gideon
00:03:19 could not see himself as Jehovah saw him.
00:03:23 What about Moses?
00:03:25 In Exodus chapter 4,
00:03:27 when Jehovah assigned him to lead Israel out of Egypt,
00:03:30 Moses was keenly aware of all of his inadequacies.
00:03:35 In fact, when talking with Jehovah,
00:03:37 he raised one objection after another.
00:03:41 Well, was Jehovah aware of the inadequacies that Moses had?
00:03:46 Of course! Of course he was!
00:03:49 He also knew that Moses’ brother, Aaron, was older
00:03:52 and that he was a better speaker.
00:03:56 But Jehovah saw in Moses qualities of faith,
00:04:01 unselfishness, and meekness
00:04:04 —qualities that made Moses
00:04:07 the right choice for the job.
00:04:11 What about Jeremiah?
00:04:13 When Jehovah commissioned him to serve as a prophet, do you remember what he said?
00:04:16 Let’s look at it.
00:04:18 Jeremiah chapter 1
00:04:22 —Jeremiah chapter 1—
00:04:24 and look at verse 6.
00:04:26 Jeremiah says:
00:04:29 “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!
00:04:31 I do not know how to speak, for I am just a boy.”
00:04:36 Well, what did Jehovah say?
00:04:38 ‘Oh. OK. OK, Jeremiah, I’ll see if I can find someone else.’
00:04:42 No.
00:04:43 Look in verse 7:
00:04:45 “Jehovah then said to me: ‘Do not say, “I am just a boy.”
00:04:50 “‘For you must go to all those to whom I send you,
00:04:54 and you should say everything that I command you.’”
00:04:59 Why was Jehovah so confident
00:05:02 that Jeremiah was the right choice for this special assignment?
00:05:07 Well, of course, if you look in verse 8,
00:05:09 Jehovah said: “I am with you.”
00:05:13 Now, of course, that’s the same thing that Jehovah said to Gideon;
00:05:16 it’s the same thing he said to Moses.
00:05:18 In other words, because Jehovah was with them,
00:05:21 they would be successful.
00:05:23 But there’s another reason too.
00:05:25 Do you see what it says in verse 5?
00:05:28 Jehovah said to Jeremiah:
00:05:30 “Before I formed you in the womb
00:05:34 “I knew [isn’t that interesting? I knew] you,
00:05:39 “and before you were born I sanctified you.
00:05:42 I made you a prophet to the nations.”
00:05:45 Jehovah knew Jeremiah.
00:05:49 He saw in Jeremiah certain qualities
00:05:51 that would make him an effective prophet with Jehovah’s help.
00:05:57 Well, could Jeremiah see that in himself?
00:06:00 No.
00:06:02 He just had to trust in Jehovah’s assessment,
00:06:05 move forward, and do what Jehovah asked him to do.
00:06:11 Well, we have wonderful examples of this in our modern day too.
00:06:15 Brother John Booth was a faithful, humble brother.
00:06:19 He started in full-time service in 1928.
00:06:24 Now, in 1935,
00:06:26 he was called to work at the factory at Bethel.
00:06:30 But now, just after working for a few days,
00:06:33 he was very surprised when Brother Knorr invited him
00:06:37 to go on the road as a regional service director,
00:06:40 what we would perhaps call a circuit overseer today.
00:06:43 Brother Knorr explained there was a great need
00:06:47 and that Brother Booth could be a big help
00:06:49 because of his experience as a pioneer.
00:06:53 But Brother Booth replied
00:06:55 that he had never had a position in the congregation.
00:06:58 He had never given a talk. Can you imagine?
00:07:01 And he had no training to do so.
00:07:05 But here’s what Brother Knorr said:
00:07:07 “Eloquent speakers are not what is needed,
00:07:12 “just someone who loves the service and will take the lead in it
00:07:16 and will talk about service at the meetings.”
00:07:21 Brother Booth said: “With misgivings, doubts, and fears,
00:07:26 but wanting to do Jehovah’s will, I agreed to try it.”
00:07:31 Well, how did it turn out?
00:07:33 Brother Booth moved forward.
00:07:35 He spent his whole life in full-time service,
00:07:39 later serving for more than 20 years
00:07:42 as a member of the Governing Body.
00:07:44 When he finished his earthly course,
00:07:47 The Watchtower  stated:
00:07:49 “[He] was beloved for his profoundly humble
00:07:53 and kind Christian personality.”
00:07:56 Obviously, Jehovah saw something good
00:08:01 in Brother John Booth.
00:08:04 Well, what do we learn from these examples?
00:08:06 Like Gideon and Moses and Jeremiah and Brother Booth,
00:08:11 we might feel inadequate  for certain assignments.
00:08:15 And it’s good that we’re not overconfident or too self-reliant.
00:08:20 Yet, we don’t want to go to the other extreme either.
00:08:24 If so, you see, we could begin to think:
00:08:26 ‘I could never be a pioneer. I could never be a ministerial servant.
00:08:31 ‘I could never be an elder. I could never be a Bethelite.
00:08:34 I could never be a construction servant,’ and on and on and on.
00:08:39 If we’re given one of those assignments or some other one,
00:08:42 we could even hesitate to accept
00:08:45 —give in to fear.
00:08:47 But the fact is that we cannot fully see ourselves
00:08:52 as Jehovah does.
00:08:55 How much better to make ourselves available
00:08:58 and then move forward with the work that we’re given to do,
00:09:02 looking to Jehovah to make up  for whatever we may lack!
00:09:08 Well, now, you students, who are soon-to-be graduates,
00:09:11 will no doubt have a variety of assignments
00:09:15 in the coming years.
00:09:17 Whatever those assignments are,
00:09:19 move forward with full confidence in Jehovah.
00:09:24 Jehovah will be with you.
00:09:26 He’ll give you everything that you need to be successful
00:09:30 in accomplishing the work.
00:09:32 So here’s the question:
00:09:35 Can you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?
00:09:39 Well, perhaps to some extent, yes, but not completely.
00:09:44 So be ready to listen to counsel
00:09:48 and to make adjustments.
00:09:50 But also, when your good qualities
00:09:54 and your good potential are noticed
00:09:57 and you receive new assignments,
00:10:00 grab hold and move forward.
00:10:05 And may our wonderful God, Jehovah,
00:10:08 always be with you and bless you as you do so.
