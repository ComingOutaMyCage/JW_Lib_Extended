00:00:02 During his earthly ministry,
00:00:05 Jesus expelled demons.
00:00:08 He healed the sick.
00:00:10 He fed multitudes.
00:00:13 He even raised the dead.
00:00:16 But was he known
00:00:18 as the Great Demon-Expeller,
00:00:21 the Great Healer,
00:00:23 the Great Feeder-of-Multitudes,
00:00:26 or the Great Resurrector?
00:00:29 No.
00:00:30 But he was known as the Great Teacher.
00:00:34 Why?
00:00:36 Because he primarily focused his efforts
00:00:39 on the preaching and teaching work.
00:00:42 But now, why did he do this?
00:00:45 Well, he knew physical miracles
00:00:48 would only bring temporary benefits.
00:00:52 He knew ones freed from the demons,
00:00:54 ones that were healed, fed, and even resurrected
00:00:59 would eventually grow old and die.
00:01:03 So how could he help people permanently?
00:01:07 Well, he knew he could only do it
00:01:10 by teaching them the life-saving knowledge
00:01:14 about his Father, Jehovah.
00:01:16 He well knew the truthfulness
00:01:19 of what he stated as recorded at John 17:3:
00:01:23 ‘This means everlasting life,
00:01:26 ‘their coming to know you, the only true God,
00:01:29 and the one He sent, Jesus Christ.’
00:01:33 So even though he did many amazing things,
00:01:37 he focused primarily on the preaching and teaching work,
00:01:42 becoming the greatest Teacher ever to walk this earth.
00:01:47 In fact, when officers were sent to arrest him,
00:01:51 do you remember what happened?
00:01:53 They came back empty-handed.
00:01:54 Why?
00:01:55 Well, they said: “Never has any man spoken like this.”
00:02:01 They were so awestruck by his teaching,
00:02:06 they couldn’t even bring themselves to arrest him.
00:02:09 Large crowds would stick with him for days,
00:02:12 even without eating in order to listen to his teaching.
00:02:17 In contrast to the quality of Jesus’ teaching,
00:02:21 Acts chapter 20 tells us about the apostle Paul
00:02:26 giving a long, long talk.
00:02:30 And during that talk, you’ll remember that the young man Eutychus
00:02:34 sank into a deep, deep sleep
00:02:38 and even fell out of the third-story window of a building.
00:02:42 Now, of course, Paul resurrected him,
00:02:44 but probably he felt responsible
00:02:47 for putting him to sleep like that.
00:02:52 But, no offense to Paul, I’m sure he was doing the best he could.
00:02:58 But, obviously, his teaching
00:03:00 was not on a par with that of the Great Teacher.
00:03:04 And that makes me think of what a brother said to me in a teasing way.
00:03:07 He said: “Brother Lett, I always look forward to your talks.
00:03:11 I know I’m going to wake up totally refreshed.”
00:03:18 Well, it’s really true that none of us, like Paul,
00:03:22 can begin to match the quality of teaching of the Great Teacher.
00:03:27 But what are we told at 1 Peter 2:21?
00:03:32 We are told “to follow his steps closely.”
00:03:35 We can’t do it perfectly,
00:03:37 but we’re told to do it as closely as we can.
00:03:41 So that means all of us.
00:03:43 But especially as we’re talking to you,
00:03:45 dear Gilead students, soon-to-be-graduates,
00:03:48 you must make the preaching and teaching work
00:03:52 a priority.
00:03:54 And we must do our best
00:03:56 and you must do your best to improve in your teaching.
00:03:59 And how can you do that?
00:04:01 By imitating the Great Teacher.
00:04:05 During this talk (even though much of what we will talk about
00:04:09 will concern the public ministry),
00:04:11 what we’re going to discuss (much of it)
00:04:13 would be applicable to teaching on a personal level
00:04:18 and in the congregation.
00:04:20 So especially you brothers (but all of us),
00:04:23 want to imitate Jesus’ teaching methods
00:04:27 as we shepherd Jehovah’s sheep on a personal level
00:04:31 and as we do so on a congregational level
00:04:35 from the platform.
00:04:37 Now, here’s a question:
00:04:39 How did Jesus become the Great Teacher?
00:04:44 Well, the Bible tells us that for aeons and aeons of time,
00:04:48 as “a master worker” beside Jehovah,
00:04:52 he carefully observed and he imitated his Father.
00:04:56 And he thereby acquired amazing teaching skills.
00:05:00 He learned from the greatest Teacher.
00:05:03 And no wonder he became the Great Teacher.
00:05:06 He learned from his heavenly Father,
00:05:08 and he appropriately gave credit where it belongs.
00:05:12 Go to John chapter 8, please,
00:05:16 and notice how he gave the credit for his
00:05:18 speaking and teaching where it belongs.
00:05:22 John 8 and the B  part of verse 28:
00:05:25 “I do nothing of my own initiative;
00:05:30 “but just as the Father taught me,
00:05:33 I speak these things.”
00:05:36 Yes, he imitated his Father.
00:05:39 Now we want to imitate him.
00:05:41 But what specific teaching methods
00:05:44 did he utilize and did he learn from the greatest Teacher?
00:05:48 Well, let’s discuss four.
00:05:50 Now, one, he taught with enthusiasm
00:05:55 and conviction.
00:05:57 Matthew 7:29:
00:05:59 “For he was teaching them
00:06:01 “as a person having authority,
00:06:05 and not as their scribes.”
00:06:07 So doesn’t that indicate enthusiasm, conviction,
00:06:10 and authority is what he taught?
00:06:12 So if we’re not enthusiastic about what we teach
00:06:16 in the ministry or from the platform,
00:06:19 how could we expect our listeners to be enthusiastic about it?
00:06:24 So never would we want to come across halfhearted in our teaching.
00:06:28 Just like enthusiastic teaching is contagious,
00:06:32 halfhearted teaching is contagious too, isn’t it?
00:06:35 You could perhaps liken it to yawning.
00:06:38 One person yawns in a room, and pretty soon everybody is yawning.
00:06:42 And that could be the way with halfhearted teaching.
00:06:45 But as a caution, we don’t want to be
00:06:48 theatrical in our speaking.
00:06:51 That means we wouldn’t want to use extreme gestures
00:06:54 or dramatic expressions
00:06:58 —overly theatrical or even theatrical.
00:07:01 Why?
00:07:02 Because now you end up drawing attention to yourself
00:07:05 —don’t you?— rather than to what you’re teaching.
00:07:08 And that’s emphasis in the wrong place, isn’t it?
00:07:11 But now let’s talk about a second method the Great Teacher utilized.
00:07:16 He was a good listener.
00:07:19 Where did he learn this pattern of being a good listener?
00:07:23 Well, open up to Isaiah chapter 50, please,
00:07:27 and notice what is prophetically said about Jesus
00:07:31 and where he learned to be a good listener.
00:07:35 Notice in chapter 50 and right at the end of verse 4.
00:07:39 Let’s begin there: “He [Jehovah]
00:07:42 “awakens my ear to listen
00:07:46 “like the taught ones.
00:07:48 “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear,
00:07:51 “and I was not rebellious.
00:07:54 I did not turn in the opposite direction.”
00:07:57 So Jehovah opened his ear,
00:07:59 trained him to be a good listener, and he responded well, did he not?
00:08:04 And that’s why when he became a human,
00:08:07 from childhood on,
00:08:10 he continued his pattern of being a good listener, didn’t he?
00:08:14 Do you recall the account in Luke chapter 2
00:08:17 when Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus
00:08:19 after three days when he was only 12 years old?
00:08:22 Where did they find him?
00:08:24 It says that he was “sitting in the midst of the teachers” there in the temple
00:08:28 and listening to them
00:08:31 and then also asking them questions.
00:08:34 Then when he began his career as a disciple-maker at age 30,
00:08:39 it was second nature—wasn’t it?— to be a good listener.
00:08:42 Now, think of this: Even though he had more to say
00:08:47 than any other human has ever had to say,
00:08:50 he knew the value of pausing, drawing out his audience,
00:08:55 and then really listening to them.
00:08:59 And the same is true with us.
00:09:01 You may think especially after Gilead School that you’ve got a lot to say.
00:09:06 But if we’re going to imitate the Great Teacher,
00:09:08 we have to use self-control.
00:09:10 We have to pause and draw people out
00:09:13 and then really listen to them.
00:09:16 And when we serve as an assistant, which sometimes is half the time,
00:09:19 we want to be active listeners.
00:09:23 What does that mean (to be an active listener)?
00:09:26 Well, maybe you would nod periodically in agreement.
00:09:31 Or maybe you would add some little comment, such as, “Well, that’s very interesting.”
00:09:35 You might even ask for clarification.
00:09:38 People like to clarify what they’re saying.
00:09:40 It shows you’re really interested in what’s happening.
00:09:43 So whether we’re the one presenting
00:09:46 or the one who is an assistant, we want to be an active listener.
00:09:50 There’s probably nothing more distracting
00:09:53 than having your assistant playing with the dog
00:09:57 or maybe looking down the street to see what’s happening down the street.
00:10:01 Pretty soon, your householder is looking down the street to see what’s happening.
00:10:05 Be an active listener.
00:10:08 Well, let’s get our third method the Great Teacher used.
00:10:13 He used thought-provoking questions.
00:10:17 And methods two and three do go hand in hand —don’t they?—
00:10:19 because if you ask good questions,
00:10:21 you’re likely going to have more to listen to.
00:10:25 But what if some of Jehovah’s people tend to shy away,
00:10:29 perhaps, from using questions?
00:10:32 What if they just like to present information
00:10:34 and kind of control everything?
00:10:37 Well, if you think about it, it’s probably easier just to present information
00:10:41 even though it’s not nearly as effective.
00:10:43 When you ask questions
00:10:46 and then you get a response from the householder,
00:10:50 it’s kind of like bouncing a football.
00:10:53 Now, when you bounce a basketball, it’s predictable—isn’t it?—but not a football.
00:10:58 And it’s the same way with people.
00:10:59 They come back with all kinds of responses,
00:11:02 and you’ve got to be willing and able
00:11:04 to adapt according to their responses.
00:11:07 Some don’t like that uncertainty, so they would rather just present information.
00:11:11 But as we said, that’s not going to be nearly as effective
00:11:15 as those who have learned to imitate the Great Teacher
00:11:19 and effectively teach with questions.
00:11:23 Now, you Gilead students
00:11:25 have certainly seen the value of good questions during class.
00:11:30 It made it so much more enjoyable —didn’t it?—
00:11:33 and it enhanced your learning tremendously
00:11:36 when your instructors used these good questions.
00:11:39 Why is that more effective,
00:11:43 to proficiently use questions?
00:11:45 Well, for one thing, you involve your listener
00:11:48 in the conversation.
00:11:50 And what do you enjoy more?
00:11:52 Being given a sermon or being involved in a conversation?
00:11:56 The answer is obvious, isn’t it?
00:11:57 So involve the listener. It’s more enjoyable.
00:12:00 Another thing is that you gain valuable information about your listener,
00:12:05 which you can use to really help that one.
00:12:08 Well, what are types of questions we can use?
00:12:11 You can use “what do you think” questions.
00:12:15 Jesus used them.
00:12:17 As an example, Matthew 18:12:
00:12:21 “What do you think?
00:12:23 If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays . . . ”
00:12:26 —we know the rest of the illustration.
00:12:27 But he started out with: “What do you think?”
00:12:29 And people generally like to give their opinion
00:12:32 and, in a sense, there’s no wrong answer —is there?—
00:12:35 because whatever they say, that’s what they think.
00:12:38 That’s what you asked for, right?
00:12:40 You asked, “What do you think?”
00:12:41 And people like to give their opinion.
00:12:45 It makes it enjoyable.
00:12:46 You can also use multiple-choice questions.
00:12:51 That sometimes makes it easier for the householder to answer.
00:12:55 Jesus gave an example in Matthew 17:25.
00:13:00 He said: “[Simon,] from whom do the kings of the earth
00:13:04 “receive duties or head tax?
00:13:08 From their sons or from the strangers?”
00:13:12 Many of our tracts use multiple-choice questions—don’t they?—
00:13:16 and we can effectively use those.
00:13:18 And if you think about it, the right question
00:13:21 can often enable us
00:13:24 to overcome potential conversation stoppers
00:13:27 and keep the conversation going.
00:13:29 For example, if a person says, “You people don’t believe in Jesus,”
00:13:33 we might say: “Well, may I please ask, why do you say that?
00:13:39 Did someone tell you that about us?”
00:13:42 Harmless questions can keep that conversation going
00:13:45 until you get valuable information
00:13:47 that perhaps you can use to help the person.
00:13:50 A person says, “I don’t believe in the Bible.”
00:13:53 “May I please ask why you feel that way?
00:13:58 May I ask how long you have felt that way?”
00:14:01 Keep it going.
00:14:02 One brother said that during pioneer school
00:14:05 he had those questions drilled into his head:
00:14:08 “Why do you feel that way?
00:14:10 How long have you felt that way?”
00:14:11 A woman came to the door and said, “I can’t talk; I’m pregnant.”
00:14:15 And he said, “Well, may I ask how long you’ve felt that way?”
00:14:21 Don’t do that.
00:14:24 Like we said before, you’ve got to be a good listener.
00:14:29 But then what about using thought-provoking questions
00:14:33 when conducting a Bible study?
00:14:35 As you well know, our new study book
00:14:39 is loaded with thought-provoking questions —isn’t it?—
00:14:42 and we certainly want to fully utilize them.
00:14:45 But occasionally we may need to add auxiliary questions.
00:14:50 But remember, most of what a good teacher says during a Bible study
00:14:54 is in the form of questions.
00:14:57 I know for myself, I’ve really tried hard to train myself
00:15:02 when I’m about ready to make a statement, say something.
00:15:05 ‘Wait a minute; let me change that.
00:15:07 ‘Let me change it to a question,
00:15:10 and let me draw out from the student what I was about to say.’
00:15:15 That’s going to be more effective, isn’t it?
00:15:17 It’s normally much better
00:15:21 than explaining a scripture
00:15:24 to a student to have the student explain it to you.
00:15:28 And don’t be afraid of a little silence.
00:15:32 If you ask a question and there is silence,
00:15:35 some of us think that we have to quickly fill in the gap by saying something.
00:15:39 But if they’re thinking, let them think.
00:15:43 Of course, you have to know your student.
00:15:46 If they have no clue what the answer is,
00:15:48 then don’t let them just sit there and sizzle.
00:15:52 Throw them a rope.
00:15:53 Throw them an auxiliary question.
00:15:57 But now we’re going to go to our fourth method
00:16:01 that the Great Teacher learned from the greatest Teacher:
00:16:04 He effectively used illustrations.
00:16:08 And that was certainly a powerful teaching tool indeed.
00:16:13 Matthew 13:34:
00:16:15 “Without an illustration
00:16:17 [Jesus] would not speak.”
00:16:20 But here’s a question:
00:16:22 Do you think that Jesus’ illustrations
00:16:26 were the product of spur-of-the-moment thinking?
00:16:29 Well, there’s no doubt about it that his perfect brain certainly helped
00:16:32 to be able to come up with amazing illustrations.
00:16:35 But nevertheless, the indication is
00:16:37 that he cultivated the ability
00:16:40 to effectively use illustrations.
00:16:43 If he saw a shepherd, for example, taking care of his sheep,
00:16:47 he likely meditated, ‘Now, how can I use this situation
00:16:52 to teach vital truths?’
00:16:54 He did the same when he saw, for example, a fisherman letting down his nets,
00:16:59 a farmer sowing seed,
00:17:01 or maybe builders constructing a tower.
00:17:06 ‘How can I use this
00:17:08 to make powerful illustrations that teach vital truths?’
00:17:12 Even with simple items
00:17:15 like birds, lilies, a lamp on a lampstand,
00:17:20 a wineskin, leaven, a mustard seed, salt, the young child
00:17:25 he thought, ‘How can I use these simple items
00:17:27 to teach vital truths?’
00:17:29 And it was amazing how he did that.
00:17:32 And the same is true with us.
00:17:33 All around us, if we train ourselves to think that way,
00:17:37 there are circumstances, there are situations,
00:17:41 there are even items that we can use
00:17:44 and make them into powerful illustrations.
00:17:47 And we can powerfully elevate the quality of our teaching.
00:17:51 Now, here’s an example.
00:17:53 Some time ago, a brother noticed a little baby
00:17:56 with a pacifier.
00:17:58 This pacifier had been dipped in sugar water and put in the baby’s mouth.
00:18:02 And he was thinking: ‘You know, that’s a very good illustration
00:18:06 ‘of many, many in Christendom.
00:18:09 ‘They’re satisfied with what they have,
00:18:12 ‘even though they have no real spiritual nourishment.
00:18:17 ‘But we’re looking for those who are not satisfied,
00:18:20 those who are conscious of their spiritual need.’
00:18:24 And he was able to use that in a talk.
00:18:26 What are cautions regarding the use of illustrations?
00:18:30 Well, here are just a couple.
00:18:31 An illustration should not be too long or complicated.
00:18:36 If it is, simplify it or discard it.
00:18:41 That’s what the School Guidebook  tells us.
00:18:44 Here’s another caution: To be effective,
00:18:48 the illustration must be familiar to
00:18:51 and fit your audience.
00:18:54 For example, what if you used the illustration
00:18:57 that Satan’s system is like a male platypus?
00:19:02 Now, in some parts of Australia, that might be a good illustration
00:19:06 because they know a male platypus
00:19:08 looks harmless, he looks innocent,
00:19:12 but his hind legs are armed with ankle spurs
00:19:15 connected to venom glands.
00:19:17 So he looks harmless, but he could be very dangerous.
00:19:21 But that only works if you’re dealing with people that are familiar
00:19:25 with that particular animal.
00:19:27 But skillfully selected and used,
00:19:31 illustrations are very effective.
00:19:34 They stimulate thinking,
00:19:36 they arrest and hold attention,
00:19:38 they motivate the heart and conscience of our listener,
00:19:42 and they serve as powerful memory aids.
00:19:45 A good illustration
00:19:47 is going to be remembered years later
00:19:50 along with (and this is the important thing)
00:19:52 a point that it was designed to highlight.
00:19:57 Well, there we have four teaching methods
00:20:01 utilized by the Great Teacher
00:20:03 that he learned from the greatest Teacher, as we said.
00:20:06 And we want to do our best to copy, or imitate, his way of teaching.
00:20:11 And I know you Gilead students have an enhanced desire to do that
00:20:16 in the congregation and also in your territory
00:20:20 that you’re going to be working in.
00:20:23 So let’s work hard
00:20:25 to teach with enthusiasm and conviction,
00:20:29 let’s be a good listener,
00:20:32 let’s use thought-provoking questions,
00:20:35 and let’s use effective illustrations.
00:20:39 If you work hard, you dear students, almost graduates,
00:20:43 to employ these same teaching techniques,
00:20:46 then you’re going to be a lot more skillful
00:20:49 in reaching the hearts of your listeners.
00:20:52 And there’s a lot at stake, isn’t it?
00:20:54 I mean, if you think about it, the lives of our brothers and sisters are at stake.
00:20:58 And with the “art of teaching” learned from the Great Teacher,
00:21:02 we want to help as many of them as we can
00:21:05 to make it into that new world.
00:21:07 And then also the lives of honesthearted ones in our territory
00:21:12 hang in the balance, don’t they?
00:21:14 So we want to find them before it’s too late.
00:21:18 And using the art of teaching learned from the Great Teacher,
00:21:22 we want to motivate them to come into the safety
00:21:26 of Jehovah’s organization.
00:21:29 And if you think about it, it’s good to remember
00:21:32 that what we’re doing now in the way of learning to teach
00:21:36 is really preparing us
00:21:38 for the greatest teaching campaign
00:21:41 ever in all human history —the teaching of billions
00:21:46 who will be coming back in the resurrection.
00:21:49 You could say our work now is like a warm-up, isn’t it?
00:21:52 It’s a warm-up for that greatest teaching campaign
00:21:56 that is just around the corner.
00:22:00 So please continue to observe carefully
00:22:04 the teaching of the Great Teacher,
00:22:06 and you learned a lot about that in school, no doubt about it.
00:22:08 And may Jehovah continue
00:22:11 to bless you most beloved Gilead students, almost graduates.
00:22:16 May he bless you as you apply
00:22:19 all the wonderful things you’ve learned during this school,
00:22:23 and that includes learning
00:22:25 to imitate the Great Teacher.
