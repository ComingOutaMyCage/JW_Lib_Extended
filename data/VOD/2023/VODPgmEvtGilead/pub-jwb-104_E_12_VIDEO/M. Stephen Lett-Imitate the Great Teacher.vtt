00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:05.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his earthly ministry,

00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:08.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus expelled demons.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
He healed the sick.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
He fed multitudes.

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:16.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even raised the dead.

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was he known

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the Great Demon-Expeller,

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:23.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Great Healer,

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:26.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Great Feeder-of-Multitudes,

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:29.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the Great Resurrector?

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:30.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:34.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was known as the Great Teacher.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he primarily focused his efforts

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:42.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the preaching and teaching work.

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:45.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, why did he do this?

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:48.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he knew physical miracles

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:52.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
would only bring temporary benefits.

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew ones freed from the demons,

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:59.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
ones that were healed, fed,
and even resurrected

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:03.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
would eventually grow old and die.

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:07.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how could he help people permanently?

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:10.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he knew he could only do it

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:14.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
by teaching them the life-saving knowledge

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:16.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his Father, Jehovah.

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:19.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
He well knew the truthfulness

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:23.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what he stated as recorded at John 17:3:

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:26.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This means everlasting life,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘their coming to know you, the only true God,

00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:33.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the one He sent, Jesus Christ.’

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:37.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though he did many amazing things,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
he focused primarily
on the preaching and teaching work,

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:47.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
becoming the greatest Teacher
ever to walk this earth.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:51.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
when officers were sent to arrest him,

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you remember what happened?

00:01:53.054 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
They came back empty-handed.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:55.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:55.974 --> 00:02:00.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they said:
“Never has any man spoken like this.”

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:06.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so awestruck by his teaching, 

00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:09.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
they couldn’t even
bring themselves to arrest him.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Large crowds would stick with him for days,

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:17.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
even without eating
in order to listen to his teaching.

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:21.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast
to the quality of Jesus’ teaching,

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts chapter 20
tells us about the apostle Paul

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:30.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving a long, long talk.

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:34.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during that talk, you’ll remember
that the young man Eutychus

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:38.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
sank into a deep, deep sleep

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:42.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even fell out of the third-story window
of a building.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, Paul resurrected him,

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:47.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
but probably he felt responsible

00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:50.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
for putting him to sleep like that.

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, no offense to Paul,
I’m sure he was doing the best he could.

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:00.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, obviously, his teaching

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:04.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not on a par
with that of the Great Teacher.

00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that makes me think of what
a brother said to me in a teasing way.

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:11.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Brother Lett,
I always look forward to your talks.

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:14.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know
I’m going to wake up totally refreshed.”

00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:22.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s really true that none of us,
like Paul,

00:03:22.314 --> 00:03:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
can begin to match
the quality of teaching of the Great Teacher.

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:32.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are we told at 1 Peter 2:21?

00:03:32.282 --> 00:03:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are told “to follow his steps closely.”

00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:37.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t do it perfectly,

00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:41.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’re told to do it as closely as we can.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that means all of us.

00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:45.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
But especially as we’re talking to you,

00:03:45.254 --> 00:03:48.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
dear Gilead students, soon-to-be-graduates,

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:52.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must make
the preaching and teaching work

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:54.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
a priority.

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:56.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we must do our best

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you must do your best
to improve in your teaching.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can you do that?

00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:05.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
By imitating the Great Teacher.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:09.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this talk
(even though much of what we will talk about

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
will concern the public ministry),

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’re going to discuss (much of it)

00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:18.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be applicable
to teaching on a personal level

00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:20.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the congregation.

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
So especially you brothers (but all of us),

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
want to imitate Jesus’ teaching methods

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we shepherd Jehovah’s sheep
on a personal level

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as we do so on a congregational level

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the platform.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a question:

00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:44.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus become the Great Teacher?

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:48.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible tells us
that for aeons and aeons of time,

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:52.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a master worker” beside Jehovah,

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:56.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
he carefully observed
and he imitated his Father.

00:04:56.286 --> 00:05:00.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he thereby acquired
amazing teaching skills.

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned from the greatest Teacher.

00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:06.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no wonder he became the Great Teacher.

00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:08.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned from his heavenly Father,

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:12.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he appropriately gave credit
where it belongs.

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:16.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go to John chapter 8, please,

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:18.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice how he gave the credit for his

00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:22.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking and teaching where it belongs.

00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:25.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 8 and the <i>B</i>  part of verse 28:

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I do nothing of my own initiative;

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but just as the Father taught me,

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:36.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
I speak these things.”

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:39.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he imitated his Father.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we want to imitate him.

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:44.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what specific teaching methods

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
did he utilize and did he learn
from the greatest Teacher?

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:50.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s discuss four.

00:05:50.843 --> 00:05:55.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one, he taught with enthusiasm

00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:57.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conviction.

00:05:57.683 --> 00:05:59.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 7:29:

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:01.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he was teaching them

00:06:01.687 --> 00:06:05.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a person having authority,

00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:07.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not as their scribes.”

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So doesn’t that indicate
enthusiasm, conviction,

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and authority is what he taught?

00:06:12.198 --> 00:06:16.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we’re not enthusiastic
about what we teach

00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:19.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ministry or from the platform,

00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:24.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
how could we expect our listeners
to be enthusiastic about it?

00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:28.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
So never would we want
to come across halfhearted in our teaching.

00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like enthusiastic teaching
is contagious,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
halfhearted teaching
is contagious too, isn’t it?

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could perhaps liken it to yawning.

00:06:38.517 --> 00:06:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
One person yawns in a room,
and pretty soon everybody is yawning.

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:45.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that could be the way
with halfhearted teaching.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as a caution, we don’t want to be

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
theatrical in our speaking.

00:06:51.197 --> 00:06:54.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means
we wouldn’t want to use extreme gestures

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
or dramatic expressions

00:06:58.038 --> 00:07:01.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
—overly theatrical or even theatrical.

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:02.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:05.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because now you end up drawing
attention to yourself

00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:08.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
—don’t you?—
rather than to what you’re teaching.

00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:11.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s emphasis in the wrong place,
isn’t it?

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:16.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s talk about a second method
the Great Teacher utilized.

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:19.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a good listener.

00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:23.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did he learn this pattern
of being a good listener?

00:07:23.814 --> 00:07:27.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, open up to Isaiah chapter 50, please,

00:07:27.985 --> 00:07:31.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice what is prophetically said
about Jesus

00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:35.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where he learned to be a good listener.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:39.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in chapter 50
and right at the end of verse 4.

00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:42.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin there: “He [Jehovah]

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:46.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“awakens my ear to listen

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:48.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the taught ones.

00:07:48.632 --> 00:07:51.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Sovereign Lord Jehovah
has opened my ear,

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:54.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I was not rebellious.

00:07:54.012 --> 00:07:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did not turn in the opposite direction.”

00:07:57.433 --> 00:07:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah opened his ear,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
trained him to be a good listener,
and he responded well, did he not?

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why when he became a human,

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:10.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
from childhood on,

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:14.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
he continued his pattern
of being a good listener, didn’t he?

00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:17.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall the account in Luke chapter 2

00:08:17.287 --> 00:08:19.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus

00:08:19.873 --> 00:08:22.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
after three days
when he was only 12 years old?

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did they find him?

00:08:24.294 --> 00:08:28.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that he was “sitting in the midst
of the teachers” there in the temple

00:08:28.256 --> 00:08:31.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listening to them

00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:34.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then also asking them questions.

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:39.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when he began his career
as a disciple-maker at age 30,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was second nature—wasn’t it?—
to be a good listener.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:47.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think of this:
Even though he had more to say

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
than any other human has ever had to say,

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:55.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knew the value of pausing,
drawing out his audience,

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:59.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then really listening to them.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same is true with us.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:06.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may think especially after Gilead School
that you’ve got a lot to say.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’re going to imitate
the Great Teacher,

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to use self-control.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to pause and draw people out

00:09:13.512 --> 00:09:16.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then really listen to them.

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:19.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we serve as an assistant,
which sometimes is half the time,

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:23.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to be active listeners.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean
(to be an active listener)?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe
you would nod periodically in agreement.

00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe you would add some little comment,
such as, “Well, that’s very interesting.”

00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:38.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might even ask for clarification.

00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:40.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
People like to clarify what they’re saying.

00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows you’re really interested
in what’s happening.

00:09:43.543 --> 00:09:46.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whether we’re the one presenting

00:09:46.087 --> 00:09:50.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the one who is an assistant,
we want to be an active listener.

00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:53.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s probably nothing more distracting

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:57.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
than having your assistant
playing with the dog

00:09:57.808 --> 00:10:01.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe looking down the street
to see what’s happening down the street.

00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:04.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pretty soon, your householder is looking down
the street to see what’s happening.

00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:08.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be an active listener.

00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:12.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s get our third method
the Great Teacher used.

00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used thought-provoking questions.

00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:19.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
And methods two and three do go hand in hand
—don’t they?—

00:10:19.538 --> 00:10:21.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you ask good questions,

00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:25.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re likely
going to have more to listen to.

00:10:25.586 --> 00:10:29.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if some of Jehovah’s people
tend to shy away,

00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:32.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps, from using questions?

00:10:32.218 --> 00:10:34.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if they just like to present information

00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:37.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind of control everything?

00:10:37.182 --> 00:10:41.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you think about it, it’s probably
easier just to present information

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though it’s not nearly as effective.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you ask questions

00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you get a response
from the householder,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s kind of like bouncing a football.

00:10:53.699 --> 00:10:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you bounce a basketball, it’s
predictable—isn’t it?—but not a football.

00:10:58.287 --> 00:10:59.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s the same way with people.

00:10:59.872 --> 00:11:02.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
They come back with all kinds of responses,

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve got to be willing and able

00:11:04.877 --> 00:11:07.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adapt according to their responses.

00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:11.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some don’t like that uncertainty, so they
would rather just present information.

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:15.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we said,
that’s not going to be nearly as effective

00:11:15.513 --> 00:11:19.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
as those who have learned
to imitate the Great Teacher

00:11:19.476 --> 00:11:23.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and effectively teach with questions.

00:11:23.438 --> 00:11:25.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you Gilead students

00:11:25.774 --> 00:11:30.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
have certainly seen the value
of good questions during class.

00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:33.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made it so much more enjoyable
—didn’t it?—

00:11:33.198 --> 00:11:36.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it enhanced your learning tremendously

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
when your instructors
used these good questions.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that more effective,

00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:45.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proficiently use questions?

00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:48.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
you involve your listener

00:11:48.548 --> 00:11:50.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the conversation.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you enjoy more?

00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:56.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being given a sermon
or being involved in a conversation?

00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:57.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is obvious, isn’t it?

00:11:57.765 --> 00:12:00.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So involve the listener.
It’s more enjoyable.

00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:05.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing is that you gain
valuable information about your listener,

00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:08.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
which you can use to really help that one.

00:12:08.276 --> 00:12:11.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what are types of questions we can use?

00:12:11.947 --> 00:12:15.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can use “what do you think” questions.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used them.

00:12:17.244 --> 00:12:21.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
As an example, Matthew 18:12:

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:23.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you think?

00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:26.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a man has 100 sheep
and one of them strays . . . ”

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we know the rest of the illustration.

00:12:27.755 --> 00:12:29.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he started out with: “What do you think?”

00:12:29.256 --> 00:12:32.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people generally
like to give their opinion

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in a sense, there’s no wrong answer
—is there?—

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
because whatever they say,
that’s what they think.

00:12:38.474 --> 00:12:40.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what you asked for, right?

00:12:40.184 --> 00:12:41.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
You asked, “What do you think?”

00:12:41.853 --> 00:12:45.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people like to give their opinion.

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:46.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes it enjoyable.

00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:51.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can also use multiple-choice questions.

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:55.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sometimes makes it easier
for the householder to answer.

00:12:55.534 --> 00:13:00.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus gave an example in Matthew 17:25.

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:04.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “[Simon,]
from whom do the kings of the earth

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:08.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“receive duties or head tax?

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:12.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
From their sons or from the strangers?”

00:13:12.385 --> 00:13:16.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our tracts use multiple-choice
questions—don’t they?—

00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:18.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can effectively use those.

00:13:18.766 --> 00:13:21.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it, the right question

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:24.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often enable us

00:13:24.022 --> 00:13:27.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome potential conversation stoppers

00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:29.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep the conversation going.

00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:33.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, if a person says,
“You people don’t believe in Jesus,”

00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:38.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might say: “Well, may I please ask,
why do you say that?

00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:42.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did someone tell you that about us?”

00:13:42.457 --> 00:13:45.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Harmless questions
can keep that conversation going

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:47.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
until you get valuable information

00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:50.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps you can use to help the person.

00:13:50.257 --> 00:13:52.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person says,
“I don’t believe in the Bible.”

00:13:53.677 --> 00:13:58.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May I please ask why you feel that way?

00:13:58.015 --> 00:14:01.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
May I ask how long you have felt that way?”

00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:02.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep it going.

00:14:02.937 --> 00:14:05.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother said that during pioneer school

00:14:05.273 --> 00:14:08.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had those questions drilled into his head:

00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:10.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why do you feel that way?

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long have you felt that way?”

00:14:11.988 --> 00:14:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman came to the door and said,
“I can’t talk; I’m pregnant.”

00:14:15.825 --> 00:14:18.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “Well, may I ask
how long you’ve felt that way?”

00:14:21.832 --> 00:14:23.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t do that.

00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:27.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like we said before,
you’ve got to be a good listener.

00:14:29.047 --> 00:14:33.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then what about using
thought-provoking questions

00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:35.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
when conducting a Bible study?

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you well know, our new study book

00:14:39.392 --> 00:14:42.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
is loaded with thought-provoking questions
—isn’t it?—

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we certainly want to fully utilize them.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
But occasionally
we may need to add auxiliary questions.

00:14:50.903 --> 00:14:54.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, most of what
a good teacher says during a Bible study

00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in the form of questions.

00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:02.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know for myself,
I’ve really tried hard to train myself

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’m about ready to make a statement,
say something.

00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:07.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Wait a minute; let me change that.

00:15:07.838 --> 00:15:10.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Let me change it to a question,

00:15:10.507 --> 00:15:15.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let me draw out from the student
what I was about to say.’

00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:17.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s going to be more effective, isn’t it?

00:15:17.932 --> 00:15:21.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s normally much better

00:15:21.685 --> 00:15:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
than explaining a scripture

00:15:24.814 --> 00:15:28.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a student to have
the student explain it to you.

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:32.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t be afraid of a little silence.

00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:35.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you ask a question and there is silence,

00:15:35.909 --> 00:15:39.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of us think that we have to quickly fill
in the gap by saying something.

00:15:39.871 --> 00:15:43.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if they’re thinking, let them think.

00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:46.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you have to know your student.

00:15:46.002 --> 00:15:48.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they have no clue what the answer is,

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
then don’t let them
just sit there and sizzle.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throw them a rope.

00:15:53.677 --> 00:15:57.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throw them an auxiliary question.

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:01.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we’re going
to go to our fourth method

00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Great Teacher learned
from the greatest Teacher:

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
He effectively used illustrations.

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:13.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was certainly
a powerful teaching tool indeed.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 13:34:

00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:17.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Without an illustration

00:16:17.994 --> 00:16:20.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Jesus] would not speak.”

00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:22.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s a question:

00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:26.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that Jesus’ illustrations

00:16:26.544 --> 00:16:29.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
were the product
of spur-of-the-moment thinking?

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:32.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s no doubt about it
that his perfect brain certainly helped

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:35.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to come up
with amazing illustrations.

00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:37.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
But nevertheless, the indication is

00:16:37.472 --> 00:16:40.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he cultivated the ability

00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:43.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
to effectively use illustrations.

00:16:43.228 --> 00:16:47.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he saw a shepherd, for example,
taking care of his sheep,

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:52.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
he likely meditated,
‘Now, how can I use this situation

00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:54.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach vital truths?’

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:59.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did the same when he saw, for example,
a fisherman letting down his nets,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
a farmer sowing seed,

00:17:01.873 --> 00:17:06.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe builders constructing a tower.

00:17:06.211 --> 00:17:08.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can I use this

00:17:08.797 --> 00:17:12.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make powerful illustrations
that teach vital truths?’

00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:15.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with simple items

00:17:15.345 --> 00:17:20.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
like birds, lilies, a lamp on a lampstand,

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
a wineskin, leaven, a mustard seed,
salt, the young child

00:17:25.063 --> 00:17:27.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
he thought, ‘How can I use these simple items

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach vital truths?’

00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was amazing how he did that.

00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same is true with us.

00:17:33.989 --> 00:17:37.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
All around us, if we train ourselves
to think that way,

00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:41.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are circumstances,
there are situations,

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:44.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are even items that we can use

00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:47.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them into powerful illustrations.

00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:51.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can powerfully elevate
the quality of our teaching.

00:17:51.508 --> 00:17:53.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s an example.

00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:56.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time ago,
a brother noticed a little baby

00:17:56.638 --> 00:17:58.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a pacifier.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pacifier had been dipped in sugar water
and put in the baby’s mouth.

00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:06.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was thinking:
‘You know, that’s a very good illustration

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘of many, many in Christendom.

00:18:09.777 --> 00:18:12.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They’re satisfied with what they have,

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:17.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘even though they have
no real spiritual nourishment.

00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:20.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But we’re looking for those
who are not satisfied,

00:18:20.663 --> 00:18:24.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are conscious
of their spiritual need.’

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:26.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was able to use that in a talk.

00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:30.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are cautions
regarding the use of illustrations?

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:31.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are just a couple.

00:18:31.883 --> 00:18:36.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
An illustration
should not be too long or complicated.

00:18:36.888 --> 00:18:41.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it is, simplify it or discard it.

00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:44.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the <i>School Guidebook</i>  tells us.

00:18:44.563 --> 00:18:48.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another caution: To be effective,

00:18:48.025 --> 00:18:51.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
the illustration must be familiar to

00:18:51.612 --> 00:18:54.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fit your audience.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
what if you used the illustration

00:18:57.159 --> 00:19:01.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan’s system is like a male platypus?

00:19:02.248 --> 00:19:06.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in some parts of Australia,
that might be a good illustration

00:19:06.294 --> 00:19:08.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they know a male platypus

00:19:08.963 --> 00:19:12.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks harmless, he looks innocent,

00:19:12.008 --> 00:19:15.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his hind legs are armed with ankle spurs

00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:17.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
connected to venom glands.

00:19:17.722 --> 00:19:21.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he looks harmless,
but he could be very dangerous.

00:19:21.768 --> 00:19:25.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that only works if you’re dealing
with people that are familiar

00:19:25.313 --> 00:19:27.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that particular animal.

00:19:27.774 --> 00:19:31.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
But skillfully selected and used,

00:19:31.194 --> 00:19:34.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrations are very effective.

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:36.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stimulate thinking,

00:19:36.325 --> 00:19:38.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
they arrest and hold attention,

00:19:38.994 --> 00:19:42.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
they motivate the heart and conscience
of our listener,

00:19:42.706 --> 00:19:45.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they serve as powerful memory aids.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good illustration

00:19:47.878 --> 00:19:50.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be remembered years later

00:19:50.214 --> 00:19:52.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with (and this is the important thing)

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
a point that it was designed to highlight.

00:19:57.764 --> 00:20:01.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have four teaching methods

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
utilized by the Great Teacher

00:20:03.353 --> 00:20:06.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he learned from the greatest Teacher,
as we said.

00:20:06.898 --> 00:20:11.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to do our best to copy,
or imitate, his way of teaching.

00:20:11.903 --> 00:20:16.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know you Gilead students
have an enhanced desire to do that

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation
and also in your territory

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’re going to be working in.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s work hard

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:29.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach with enthusiasm and conviction,

00:20:29.338 --> 00:20:32.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s be a good listener,

00:20:32.425 --> 00:20:35.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s use thought-provoking questions,

00:20:35.595 --> 00:20:39.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s use effective illustrations.

00:20:39.432 --> 00:20:43.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you work hard,
you dear students, almost graduates,

00:20:43.353 --> 00:20:46.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
to employ these same teaching techniques,

00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you’re going to be a lot more skillful

00:20:49.192 --> 00:20:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
in reaching the hearts of your listeners.

00:20:52.195 --> 00:20:54.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a lot at stake, isn’t it?

00:20:54.322 --> 00:20:58.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, if you think about it, the lives
of our brothers and sisters are at stake.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the “art of teaching”
learned from the Great Teacher,

00:21:02.664 --> 00:21:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to help as many of them as we can

00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make it into that new world.

00:21:07.878 --> 00:21:12.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then also the lives of honesthearted ones
in our territory

00:21:12.174 --> 00:21:14.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
hang in the balance, don’t they?

00:21:14.969 --> 00:21:18.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to find them before it’s too late.

00:21:18.973 --> 00:21:22.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
And using the art of teaching
learned from the Great Teacher,

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:26.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to motivate them
to come into the safety

00:21:26.898 --> 00:21:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,
it’s good to remember

00:21:32.237 --> 00:21:36.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what we’re doing now
in the way of learning to teach

00:21:36.157 --> 00:21:38.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really preparing us

00:21:38.743 --> 00:21:41.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the greatest teaching campaign

00:21:41.913 --> 00:21:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever in all human history
—the teaching of billions

00:21:46.418 --> 00:21:49.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will be coming back in the resurrection.

00:21:49.254 --> 00:21:52.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say our work now
is like a warm-up, isn’t it?

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:56.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a warm-up
for that greatest teaching campaign

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is just around the corner.

00:22:00.224 --> 00:22:04.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please continue to observe carefully

00:22:04.228 --> 00:22:06.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
the teaching of the Great Teacher,

00:22:06.189 --> 00:22:08.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you learned a lot about that in school,
no doubt about it.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may Jehovah continue

00:22:11.152 --> 00:22:16.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bless you most beloved
Gilead students, almost graduates.

00:22:16.032 --> 00:22:19.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
May he bless you as you apply

00:22:19.536 --> 00:22:23.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the wonderful things
you’ve learned during this school,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that includes learning

00:22:25.917 --> 00:22:28.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
to imitate the Great Teacher.
