00:00:02 Well, now we come to the true highlight
00:00:05 of our Gilead graduation program
00:00:08 —a talk by a member of the Governing Body, Brother Stephen Lett.
00:00:13 You know, 33 years ago
00:00:15 when I attended Ministerial Training School,
00:00:18 Brother Lett was one of my instructors,
00:00:21 and I’ve been learning from him ever since.
00:00:26 His theme for us today is
00:00:29 “Imitate the Great Teacher.”
00:00:34 Don’t believe a word of it!
00:00:42 During his earthly ministry,
00:00:45 Jesus expelled demons.
00:00:48 He healed the sick.
00:00:50 He fed multitudes.
00:00:53 He even raised the dead.
00:00:56 But was he known
00:00:58 as the Great Demon-Expeller,
00:01:02 the Great Healer,
00:01:04 the Great Feeder-of-Multitudes,
00:01:06 or the Great Resurrector?
00:01:09 No.
00:01:10 But he was known as the Great Teacher.
00:01:15 Why?
00:01:16 Because he primarily focused his efforts
00:01:19 on the preaching and teaching work.
00:01:22 But now, why did he do this?
00:01:25 Well, he knew physical miracles
00:01:28 would only bring temporary benefits.
00:01:32 He knew ones freed from the demons,
00:01:35 ones that were healed, fed, and even resurrected
00:01:39 would eventually grow old and die.
00:01:43 So how could he help people permanently?
00:01:47 Well, he knew he could only do it
00:01:51 by teaching them the life-saving knowledge
00:01:54 about his Father, Jehovah.
00:01:56 He well knew the truthfulness
00:01:59 of what he stated as recorded at John 17:3:
00:02:03 ‘This means everlasting life,
00:02:06 ‘their coming to know you, the only true God,
00:02:09 and the one He sent, Jesus Christ.’
00:02:13 So even though he did many amazing things,
00:02:18 he focused primarily on the preaching and teaching work,
00:02:22 becoming the greatest Teacher ever to walk this earth.
00:02:27 In fact, when officers were sent to arrest him,
00:02:31 do you remember what happened?
00:02:33 They came back empty-handed.
00:02:35 Why?
00:02:36 Well, they said: “Never has any man spoken like this.”
00:02:41 They were so awestruck by his teaching,
00:02:46 they couldn’t even bring themselves to arrest him.
00:02:49 Large crowds would stick with him for days,
00:02:53 even without eating in order to listen to his teaching.
00:02:58 In contrast to the quality of Jesus’ teaching,
00:03:01 Acts chapter 20 tells us about the apostle Paul
00:03:06 giving a long, long talk.
00:03:10 And during that talk, you’ll remember that the young man Eutychus
00:03:14 sank into a deep, deep sleep
00:03:18 and even fell out of the third-story window of a building.
00:03:22 Now, of course, Paul resurrected him,
00:03:24 but probably he felt responsible
00:03:27 for putting him to sleep like that.
00:03:32 But, no offense to Paul, I’m sure he was doing the best he could.
00:03:38 But, obviously, his teaching
00:03:40 was not on a par with that of the Great Teacher.
00:03:44 And that makes me think of what a brother said to me in a teasing way.
00:03:47 He said: “Brother Lett, I always look forward to your talks.
00:03:51 I know I’m going to wake up totally refreshed.”
00:03:58 Well, it’s really true that none of us, like Paul,
00:04:02 can begin to match the quality of teaching of the Great Teacher.
00:04:08 But what are we told at 1 Peter 2:21?
00:04:12 We are told “to follow his steps closely.”
00:04:16 We can’t do it perfectly,
00:04:18 but we’re told to do it as closely as we can.
00:04:21 So that means all of us.
00:04:23 But especially as we’re talking to you,
00:04:25 dear Gilead students, soon-to-be-graduates,
00:04:28 you must make the preaching and teaching work
00:04:32 a priority.
00:04:34 And we must do our best
00:04:36 and you must do your best to improve in your teaching.
00:04:39 And how can you do that?
00:04:41 By imitating the Great Teacher.
00:04:45 During this talk (even though much of what we will talk about
00:04:49 will concern the public ministry),
00:04:52 what we’re going to discuss (much of it)
00:04:54 would be applicable to teaching on a personal level
00:04:58 and in the congregation.
00:05:00 So especially you brothers (but all of us),
00:05:04 want to imitate Jesus’ teaching methods
00:05:07 as we shepherd Jehovah’s sheep on a personal level
00:05:12 and as we do so on a congregational level
00:05:15 from the platform.
00:05:18 Now, here’s a question:
00:05:20 How did Jesus become the Great Teacher?
00:05:24 Well, the Bible tells us that for aeons and aeons of time,
00:05:28 as “a master worker” beside Jehovah,
00:05:32 he carefully observed and he imitated his Father.
00:05:36 And he thereby acquired amazing teaching skills.
00:05:41 He learned from the greatest Teacher.
00:05:43 And no wonder he became the Great Teacher.
00:05:46 He learned from his heavenly Father,
00:05:48 and he appropriately gave credit where it belongs.
00:05:52 Go to John chapter 8, please,
00:05:56 and notice how he gave the credit for his
00:05:59 speaking and teaching where it belongs.
00:06:02 John 8 and the B  part of verse 28:
00:06:06 “I do nothing of my own initiative;
00:06:10 “but just as the Father taught me,
00:06:13 I speak these things.”
00:06:16 Yes, he imitated his Father.
00:06:19 Now we want to imitate him.
00:06:22 But what specific teaching methods
00:06:25 did he utilize and did he learn from the greatest Teacher?
00:06:29 Well, let’s discuss four.
00:06:31 Now, one, he taught with enthusiasm
00:06:35 and conviction.
00:06:37 Matthew 7:29:
00:06:39 “For he was teaching them
00:06:41 “as a person having authority,
00:06:45 and not as their scribes.”
00:06:47 So doesn’t that indicate enthusiasm, conviction,
00:06:50 and authority is what he taught?
00:06:52 So if we’re not enthusiastic about what we teach
00:06:56 in the ministry or from the platform,
00:06:59 how could we expect our listeners to be enthusiastic about it?
00:07:04 So never would we want to come across halfhearted in our teaching.
00:07:08 Just like enthusiastic teaching is contagious,
00:07:12 halfhearted teaching is contagious too, isn’t it?
00:07:15 You could perhaps liken it to yawning.
00:07:18 One person yawns in a room, and pretty soon everybody is yawning.
00:07:22 And that could be the way with halfhearted teaching.
00:07:25 But as a caution, we don’t want to be
00:07:28 theatrical in our speaking.
00:07:31 That means we wouldn’t want to use extreme gestures
00:07:34 or dramatic expressions
00:07:38 —overly theatrical or even theatrical.
00:07:41 Why?
00:07:43 Because now you end up drawing attention to yourself
00:07:45 —don’t you?— rather than to what you’re teaching.
00:07:48 And that’s emphasis in the wrong place, isn’t it?
00:07:52 But now let’s talk about a second method the Great Teacher utilized.
00:07:57 He was a good listener.
00:07:59 Where did he learn this pattern of being a good listener?
00:08:04 Well, open up to Isaiah chapter 50, please,
00:08:08 and notice what is prophetically said about Jesus
00:08:11 and where he learned to be a good listener.
00:08:15 Notice in chapter 50 and right at the end of verse 4.
00:08:19 Let’s begin there: “He [Jehovah]
00:08:22 “awakens my ear to listen
00:08:26 “like the taught ones.
00:08:28 “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear,
00:08:32 “and I was not rebellious.
00:08:34 I did not turn in the opposite direction.”
00:08:37 So Jehovah opened his ear,
00:08:40 trained him to be a good listener, and he responded well, did he not?
00:08:44 And that’s why when he became a human,
00:08:47 from childhood on,
00:08:50 he continued his pattern of being a good listener, didn’t he?
00:08:54 Do you recall the account in Luke chapter 2
00:08:57 when Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus
00:09:00 after three days when he was only 12 years old?
00:09:03 Where did they find him?
00:09:04 It says that he was “sitting in the midst of the teachers” there in the temple
00:09:08 and listening to them
00:09:11 and then also asking them questions.
00:09:14 Then when he began his career as a disciple-maker at age 30,
00:09:19 it was second nature—wasn’t it?— to be a good listener.
00:09:23 Now, think of this: Even though he had more to say
00:09:27 than any other human has ever had to say,
00:09:30 he knew the value of pausing, drawing out his audience,
00:09:35 and then really listening to them.
00:09:39 And the same is true with us.
00:09:41 You may think especially after Gilead School that you’ve got a lot to say.
00:09:46 But if we’re going to imitate the Great Teacher,
00:09:48 we have to use self-control.
00:09:50 We have to pause and draw people out
00:09:53 and then really listen to them.
00:09:56 And when we serve as an assistant, which sometimes is half the time,
00:10:00 we want to be active listeners.
00:10:03 What does that mean (to be an active listener)?
00:10:06 Well, maybe you would nod periodically in agreement.
00:10:11 Or maybe you would add some little comment, such as, “Well, that’s very interesting.”
00:10:15 You might even ask for clarification.
00:10:18 People like to clarify what they’re saying.
00:10:21 It shows you’re really interested in what’s happening.
00:10:23 So whether we’re the one presenting
00:10:26 or the one who is an assistant, we want to be an active listener.
00:10:30 There’s probably nothing more distracting
00:10:33 than having your assistant playing with the dog
00:10:38 or maybe looking down the street to see what’s happening down the street.
00:10:41 Pretty soon, your householder is looking down the street to see what’s happening.
00:10:46 Be an active listener.
00:10:49 Well, let’s get our third method the Great Teacher used.
00:10:53 He used thought-provoking questions.
00:10:57 And methods two and three do go hand in hand —don’t they?—
00:10:59 because if you ask good questions,
00:11:01 you’re likely going to have more to listen to.
00:11:05 But what if some of Jehovah’s people tend to shy away,
00:11:10 perhaps, from using questions?
00:11:12 What if they just like to present information
00:11:14 and kind of control everything?
00:11:17 Well, if you think about it, it’s probably easier just to present information
00:11:21 even though it’s not nearly as effective.
00:11:24 When you ask questions
00:11:26 and then you get a response from the householder,
00:11:30 it’s kind of like bouncing a football.
00:11:33 Now, when you bounce a basketball, it’s predictable—isn’t it?—but not a football.
00:11:38 And it’s the same way with people.
00:11:40 They come back with all kinds of responses,
00:11:42 and you’ve got to be willing and able
00:11:45 to adapt according to their responses.
00:11:47 Some don’t like that uncertainty, so they would rather just present information.
00:11:51 But as we said, that’s not going to be nearly as effective
00:11:55 as those who have learned to imitate the Great Teacher
00:11:59 and effectively teach with questions.
00:12:03 Now, you Gilead students
00:12:06 have certainly seen the value of good questions during class.
00:12:10 It made it so much more enjoyable —didn’t it?—
00:12:13 and it enhanced your learning tremendously
00:12:16 when your instructors used these good questions.
00:12:20 Why is that more effective,
00:12:23 to proficiently use questions?
00:12:25 Well, for one thing, you involve your listener
00:12:28 in the conversation.
00:12:30 And what do you enjoy more?
00:12:32 Being given a sermon or being involved in a conversation?
00:12:36 The answer is obvious, isn’t it?
00:12:38 So involve the listener. It’s more enjoyable.
00:12:40 Another thing is that you gain valuable information about your listener,
00:12:45 which you can use to really help that one.
00:12:48 Well, what are types of questions we can use?
00:12:52 You can use “what do you think” questions.
00:12:55 Jesus used them.
00:12:57 As an example, Matthew 18:12:
00:13:01 “What do you think?
00:13:03 If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays . . . ”
00:13:06 —we know the rest of the illustration.
00:13:07 But he started out with: “What do you think?”
00:13:09 And people generally like to give their opinion
00:13:12 and, in a sense, there’s no wrong answer —is there?—
00:13:15 because whatever they say, that’s what they think.
00:13:18 That’s what you asked for, right?
00:13:20 You asked, “What do you think?”
00:13:22 And people like to give their opinion.
00:13:25 It makes it enjoyable.
00:13:26 You can also use multiple-choice questions.
00:13:31 That sometimes makes it easier for the householder to answer.
00:13:35 Jesus gave an example in Matthew 17:25.
00:13:40 He said: “[Simon,] from whom do the kings of the earth
00:13:45 “receive duties or head tax?
00:13:48 From their sons or from the strangers?”
00:13:52 Many of our tracts use multiple-choice questions—don’t they?—
00:13:56 and we can effectively use those.
00:13:59 And if you think about it, the right question
00:14:01 can often enable us
00:14:04 to overcome potential conversation stoppers
00:14:07 and keep the conversation going.
00:14:09 For example, if a person says, “You people don’t believe in Jesus,”
00:14:14 we might say: “Well, may I please ask, why do you say that?
00:14:19 Did someone tell you that about us?”
00:14:22 Harmless questions can keep that conversation going
00:14:25 until you get valuable information
00:14:28 that perhaps you can use to help the person.
00:14:30 A person says, “I don’t believe in the Bible.”
00:14:33 “May I please ask why you feel that way?
00:14:38 May I ask how long you have felt that way?”
00:14:41 Keep it going.
00:14:43 One brother said that during pioneer school
00:14:45 he had those questions drilled into his head:
00:14:48 “Why do you feel that way?
00:14:50 How long have you felt that way?”
00:14:52 A woman came to the door and said, “I can’t talk; I’m pregnant.”
00:14:56 And he said, “Well, may I ask how long you’ve felt that way?”
00:15:02 Don’t do that.
00:15:05 Like we said before, you’ve got to be a good listener.
00:15:09 But then what about using thought-provoking questions
00:15:13 when conducting a Bible study?
00:15:16 As you well know, our new study book
00:15:19 is loaded with thought-provoking questions —isn’t it?—
00:15:23 and we certainly want to fully utilize them.
00:15:25 But occasionally we may need to add auxiliary questions.
00:15:31 But remember, most of what a good teacher says during a Bible study
00:15:34 is in the form of questions.
00:15:38 I know for myself, I’ve really tried hard to train myself
00:15:42 when I’m about ready to make a statement, say something.
00:15:45 ‘Wait a minute; let me change that.
00:15:48 ‘Let me change it to a question,
00:15:50 and let me draw out from the student what I was about to say.’
00:15:55 That’s going to be more effective, isn’t it?
00:15:58 It’s normally much better
00:16:01 than explaining a scripture
00:16:05 to a student to have the student explain it to you.
00:16:08 And don’t be afraid of a little silence.
00:16:12 If you ask a question and there is silence,
00:16:16 some of us think that we have to quickly fill in the gap by saying something.
00:16:20 But if they’re thinking, let them think.
00:16:23 Of course, you have to know your student.
00:16:26 If they have no clue what the answer is,
00:16:29 then don’t let them just sit there and sizzle.
00:16:32 Throw them a rope.
00:16:33 Throw them an auxiliary question.
00:16:37 But now we’re going to go to our fourth method
00:16:41 that the Great Teacher learned from the greatest Teacher:
00:16:44 He effectively used illustrations.
00:16:49 And that was certainly a powerful teaching tool indeed.
00:16:53 Matthew 13:34:
00:16:55 “Without an illustration
00:16:58 [Jesus] would not speak.”
00:17:00 But here’s a question:
00:17:03 Do you think that Jesus’ illustrations
00:17:06 were the product of spur-of-the-moment thinking?
00:17:09 Well, there’s no doubt about it that his perfect brain certainly helped
00:17:12 to be able to come up with amazing illustrations.
00:17:15 But nevertheless, the indication is
00:17:17 that he cultivated the ability
00:17:20 to effectively use illustrations.
00:17:23 If he saw a shepherd, for example, taking care of his sheep,
00:17:27 he likely meditated, ‘Now, how can I use this situation
00:17:32 to teach vital truths?’
00:17:34 He did the same when he saw, for example, a fisherman letting down his nets,
00:17:39 a farmer sowing seed,
00:17:42 or maybe builders constructing a tower.
00:17:46 ‘How can I use this
00:17:49 to make powerful illustrations that teach vital truths?’
00:17:52 Even with simple items
00:17:55 like birds, lilies, a lamp on a lampstand,
00:18:00 a wineskin, leaven, a mustard seed, salt, the young child
00:18:05 he thought, ‘How can I use these simple items
00:18:08 to teach vital truths?’
00:18:10 And it was amazing how he did that.
00:18:12 And the same is true with us.
00:18:14 All around us, if we train ourselves to think that way,
00:18:18 there are circumstances, there are situations,
00:18:21 there are even items that we can use
00:18:25 and make them into powerful illustrations.
00:18:28 And we can powerfully elevate the quality of our teaching.
00:18:31 Now, here’s an example.
00:18:33 Some time ago, a brother noticed a little baby
00:18:36 with a pacifier.
00:18:38 This pacifier had been dipped in sugar water and put in the baby’s mouth.
00:18:42 And he was thinking: ‘You know, that’s a very good illustration
00:18:46 ‘of many, many in Christendom.
00:18:50 ‘They’re satisfied with what they have,
00:18:53 ‘even though they have no real spiritual nourishment.
00:18:57 ‘But we’re looking for those who are not satisfied,
00:19:00 those who are conscious of their spiritual need.’
00:19:04 And he was able to use that in a talk.
00:19:06 What are cautions regarding the use of illustrations?
00:19:10 Well, here are just a couple.
00:19:12 An illustration should not be too long or complicated.
00:19:17 If it is, simplify it or discard it.
00:19:21 That’s what the School Guidebook  tells us.
00:19:24 Here’s another caution: To be effective,
00:19:28 the illustration must be familiar to
00:19:31 and fit your audience.
00:19:34 For example, what if you used the illustration
00:19:37 that Satan’s system is like a male platypus?
00:19:42 Now, in some parts of Australia, that might be a good illustration
00:19:46 because they know a male platypus
00:19:49 looks harmless, he looks innocent,
00:19:52 but his hind legs are armed with ankle spurs
00:19:55 connected to venom glands.
00:19:57 So he looks harmless, but he could be very dangerous.
00:20:01 But that only works if you’re dealing with people that are familiar
00:20:05 with that particular animal.
00:20:08 But skillfully selected and used,
00:20:11 illustrations are very effective.
00:20:14 They stimulate thinking,
00:20:16 they arrest and hold attention,
00:20:19 they motivate the heart and conscience of our listener,
00:20:22 and they serve as powerful memory aids.
00:20:25 A good illustration
00:20:28 is going to be remembered years later
00:20:30 along with (and this is the important thing)
00:20:32 a point that it was designed to highlight.
00:20:37 Well, there we have four teaching methods
00:20:41 utilized by the Great Teacher
00:20:43 that he learned from the greatest Teacher, as we said.
00:20:47 And we want to do our best to copy, or imitate, his way of teaching.
00:20:52 And I know you Gilead students have an enhanced desire to do that
00:20:56 in the congregation and also in your territory
00:21:00 that you’re going to be working in.
00:21:03 So let’s work hard
00:21:05 to teach with enthusiasm and conviction,
00:21:09 let’s be a good listener,
00:21:12 let’s use thought-provoking questions,
00:21:15 and let’s use effective illustrations.
00:21:19 If you work hard, you dear students, almost graduates,
00:21:23 to employ these same teaching techniques,
00:21:26 then you’re going to be a lot more skillful
00:21:29 in reaching the hearts of your listeners.
00:21:32 And there’s a lot at stake, isn’t it?
00:21:34 I mean, if you think about it, the lives of our brothers and sisters are at stake.
00:21:38 And with the “art of teaching” learned from the Great Teacher,
00:21:42 we want to help as many of them as we can
00:21:45 to make it into that new world.
00:21:48 And then also the lives of honesthearted ones in our territory
00:21:52 hang in the balance, don’t they?
00:21:55 So we want to find them before it’s too late.
00:21:59 And using the art of teaching learned from the Great Teacher,
00:22:02 we want to motivate them to come into the safety
00:22:07 of Jehovah’s organization.
00:22:09 And if you think about it, it’s good to remember
00:22:12 that what we’re doing now in the way of learning to teach
00:22:16 is really preparing us
00:22:18 for the greatest teaching campaign
00:22:22 ever in all human history —the teaching of billions
00:22:26 who will be coming back in the resurrection.
00:22:29 You could say our work now is like a warm-up, isn’t it?
00:22:32 It’s a warm-up for that greatest teaching campaign
00:22:36 that is just around the corner.
00:22:40 So please continue to observe carefully
00:22:44 the teaching of the Great Teacher,
00:22:46 and you learned a lot about that in school, no doubt about it.
00:22:49 And may Jehovah continue
00:22:51 to bless you most beloved Gilead students, almost graduates.
00:22:56 May he bless you as you apply
00:22:59 all the wonderful things you’ve learned during this school,
00:23:03 and that includes learning
00:23:06 to imitate the Great Teacher.
00:23:12 Well, we sincerely thank you, Brother Lett,
00:23:15 for those very practical comments about learning to be a good teacher.
00:23:19 It was very, very much appreciated.
00:23:26 Well, now is the time for us to present the diplomas.
00:23:30 And Brother Kenneth Flodin,
00:23:31 a helper to the Teaching Committee, is going to assist.
00:23:34 He’s going to do the hard part —mentioning all the names.

00:28:09 What a beautiful class!
00:28:12 And don’t you think Brother Flodin did well with all of those names?
00:28:22 Well, it gives me very great pleasure to introduce you now
00:28:26 to the graduates of the 153rd class of Gilead.
00:28:50 Brother Janne Kauppinen is going to read a letter from the class.
00:29:01 “To the Governing Body:
00:29:05 “Dear brothers,
00:29:08 “at the end of five memorable months,
00:29:12 “we feel moved to echo
00:29:14 “the words of 1 John 4:16:
00:29:17 “‘We have come to know and believe the love that God has for us.’
00:29:23 “One way we experienced this love was by your fine example
00:29:27 “as well as that of your helpers.
00:29:30 “We did not expect and will never forget
00:29:33 “you sacrificing your precious time and energy
00:29:37 “to provide us lectures, interviews, and even tours.
00:29:41 “As a result, we learned firsthand
00:29:44 “from your love, humility, and burning zeal for Jehovah.
00:29:51 “Our course of intensive Bible study
00:29:54 “has deepened our appreciation
00:29:56 “for the timely and upbuilding spiritual food
00:29:59 “available to all of God’s people.
00:30:03 “We are also deeply grateful to you
00:30:05 “for providing us with selfless and skillful instructors.
00:30:10 “These ‘gifts in men’ imparted their souls to us each day
00:30:15 “and regularly made our hearts burn with appreciation.
00:30:22 “Carefully considering the entire Bible chronologically
00:30:26 “has given us a deeper understanding of how Jehovah thinks.
00:30:31 “It has also increased our sensitivity to how he feels.
00:30:37 “Our in-depth consideration of Jesus’ ministry
00:30:40 “made us eyewitnesses to God’s love being revealed through him.
00:30:46 “We learned that the opposite of love is selfishness.
00:30:50 “We can only show genuine, unselfish concern for others
00:30:54 “with the help of holy spirit.
00:30:56 “Such selfless love empowers us
00:30:59 “to bring out the best in ourselves and others.
00:31:03 “We experienced this in action
00:31:06 “through the warm hospitality and overwhelming kindness
00:31:10 “shown by the United States Bethel family,
00:31:12 “who ‘abound in love for one another’
00:31:15 “and for all.
00:31:17 “This beautiful family has a permanent place in each of our hearts.
00:31:26 “Thank you for the priceless gift of Gilead training.
00:31:32 “As we leave Patterson, we are resolved to live
00:31:35 “by the words of 1 John 4:11:
00:31:39 “‘If this is how God loved us,
00:31:41 “then we are also under obligation to love one another.’
00:31:48 “We are determined to never forget what we saw and heard.
00:31:57 “Gilead —excuse me—
00:31:59 “Gilead has changed our desire and ability
00:32:03 “to serve Jehovah and our brothers better each day,
00:32:07 “stabilizing Jehovah’s organization
00:32:09 “one precious sheep at a time.
00:32:12 “We love you, dear brothers.
00:32:18 Your brothers and sisters,
153rd Gilead Class.”
00:32:35 Well, at the outset of our program,
00:32:37 we discussed the initial reluctance
00:32:41 of Gideon and Moses
00:32:45 and Jeremiah and Brother Booth
00:32:48 to accept assignments.
00:32:51 But in the final analysis, they all followed through
00:32:55 and they did what Jehovah commissioned them to do.
00:33:00 Well, we want to imitate them.
00:33:03 We want to trust that if Jehovah is allowing us to serve,
00:33:08 even if we might feel very, very inadequate,
00:33:12 he sees something good in us.
00:33:15 And he’ll make up for any lack that we feel.
00:33:20 But here’s a caution:
00:33:23 Never go to the other extreme.
00:33:26 Never become overconfident
00:33:29 and step beyond the authority that you may be given.
00:33:35 Now, in this regard, there’s an interesting account
00:33:37 that I want to just very briefly share with you.
00:33:41 It’s in 2 Kings chapter 14
00:33:47 —2 Kings chapter 14.
00:33:51 Now, as you’re turning there,
00:33:54 in this account, we read about King Amaziah of Judah.
00:33:58 Now, he had experienced
00:34:00 a great victory over the Edomites,
00:34:03 and now he wanted to go to war against Israel.
00:34:08 But King Jehoash sent him a few words of advice.
00:34:14 And I want you to just read these words, these few words,
00:34:17 and especially draw attention to one sentence.
00:34:20 So would you read it with me?
00:34:21 At 2 Kings 14:10,
00:34:25 he said: “True, you have struck down Edom,
00:34:30 so your heart has become arrogant.”
00:34:33 Now, here’s the point.
00:34:34 Now, here’s the sentence I want you to draw attention to:
00:34:37 “Enjoy your glory  but stay in your own house.”
00:34:43 Isn’t that a great line?
00:34:45 I’m going to read it one more time.
00:34:47 “Enjoy your glory,
00:34:50 “but stay in your own house.
00:34:52 “Why should you provoke disaster and fall,
00:34:56 bringing Judah down with you?”
00:34:59 Well, what’s the point?
00:35:00 You see, Jehoash said to Amaziah: ‘Enjoy the victory.
00:35:04 ‘Yeah, you won a victory. Enjoy it.
00:35:06 ‘Don’t get a big head.
00:35:08 ‘Don’t push it.
00:35:10 Stay in your own house.’
00:35:12 Some Bible translations say “stay at home.”
00:35:16 Well, as it turned out—
00:35:17 Well, you know, you’re Gilead graduates; you know how it turned out.
00:35:21 Amaziah did not listen to that advice.
00:35:25 He went on to fight against Israel,
00:35:27 and as a result, he suffered a humiliating defeat.
00:35:32 What’s the lesson?
00:35:34 You have had a wonderful spiritual victory today.
00:35:39 This is no doubt going to be one of the happiest days of your entire life
00:35:44 —graduating from Gilead School.
00:35:48 Well, it’s right that you should enjoy this day.
00:35:51 You should find so much pleasure in it
00:35:53 and feel satisfaction in what you’ve accomplished.
00:35:58 But as you experience this joy
00:36:00 and in the future as you experience the joy
00:36:03 of taking on new assignments that will come to you,
00:36:07 enjoy the moment.
00:36:09 But stay in your place.
00:36:11 Never go beyond the limits of your responsibility
00:36:16 or the authority that you’ve been given.
00:36:19 No assignment ever gives us the license
00:36:22 for us to think that we are somehow superior
00:36:24 to our brothers or to act in that way.
00:36:27 See, no doubt one of the qualities
00:36:29 that Jehovah saw in all of you is your humility
00:36:34 —your ability to consider others as superior to you
00:36:39 and to treat them in that way.
00:36:42 Keep that quality, and even strengthen it.
00:36:47 You see, some who disregarded cautions like this
00:36:51 and who succumbed to pride
00:36:53 have, like Amaziah, eventually suffered a painful defeat.
00:36:58 So, yes, this has been an especially happy day,
00:37:03 and you have many reasons to rejoice in it.
00:37:06 But as you go and care for your respective assignments,
00:37:10 remember to keep your place.
00:37:13 And then you’ll have reason to rejoice,
00:37:16 not just on this day, your graduation day,
00:37:20 but every day as you carry out your ministry
00:37:24 as the graduates of the 153rd class of Gilead.
