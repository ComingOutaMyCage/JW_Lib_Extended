00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:05.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we come to the true highlight

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:08.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Gilead graduation program

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a talk by a member of the Governing Body,
Brother Stephen Lett.

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, 33 years ago

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I attended Ministerial Training School,

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lett was one of my instructors,

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve been learning from him ever since.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
His theme for us today is

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imitate the Great Teacher.”

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:36.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t believe a word of it!

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:45.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his earthly ministry,

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus expelled demons.

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:50.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
He healed the sick.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
He fed multitudes.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even raised the dead.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was he known

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:02.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the Great Demon-Expeller,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Great Healer,

00:01:04.044 --> 00:01:06.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Great Feeder-of-Multitudes,

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:09.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the Great Resurrector?

00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:10.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was known as the Great Teacher.

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:16.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:19.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he primarily focused his efforts

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:22.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the preaching and teaching work.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, why did he do this?

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he knew physical miracles

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:32.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
would only bring temporary benefits.

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew ones freed from the demons,

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:39.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
ones that were healed, fed,
and even resurrected

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
would eventually grow old and die.

00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:47.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how could he help people permanently?

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:51.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he knew he could only do it

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:54.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
by teaching them the life-saving knowledge

00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:56.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his Father, Jehovah.

00:01:56.932 --> 00:01:59.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
He well knew the truthfulness

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what he stated as recorded at John 17:3:

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:06.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This means everlasting life,

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:09.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘their coming to know you, the only true God,

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:13.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the one He sent, Jesus Christ.’

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:18.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though he did many amazing things,

00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:22.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
he focused primarily
on the preaching and teaching work,

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:27.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
becoming the greatest Teacher
ever to walk this earth.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:31.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
when officers were sent to arrest him,

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you remember what happened?

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
They came back empty-handed.

00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:36.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:41.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they said:
“Never has any man spoken like this.”

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:46.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so awestruck by his teaching, 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
they couldn’t even
bring themselves to arrest him.

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:53.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Large crowds would stick with him for days,

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:58.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
even without eating
in order to listen to his teaching.

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:01.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast
to the quality of Jesus’ teaching,

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:06.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts chapter 20
tells us about the apostle Paul

00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:10.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving a long, long talk.

00:03:10.298 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during that talk, you’ll remember
that the young man Eutychus

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:18.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
sank into a deep, deep sleep

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even fell out of the third-story window
of a building.

00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:24.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, Paul resurrected him,

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:27.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
but probably he felt responsible

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
for putting him to sleep like that.

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:37.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, no offense to Paul,
I’m sure he was doing the best he could.

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:40.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, obviously, his teaching

00:03:40.412 --> 00:03:44.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not on a par
with that of the Great Teacher.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that makes me think of what
a brother said to me in a teasing way.

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:51.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Brother Lett,
I always look forward to your talks.

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know
I’m going to wake up totally refreshed.”

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s really true that none of us,
like Paul,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
can begin to match
the quality of teaching of the Great Teacher.

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are we told at 1 Peter 2:21?

00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:16.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are told “to follow his steps closely.”

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:18.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t do it perfectly,

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’re told to do it as closely as we can.

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:23.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that means all of us.

00:04:23.748 --> 00:04:25.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
But especially as we’re talking to you,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
dear Gilead students, soon-to-be-graduates,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must make
the preaching and teaching work

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:34.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
a priority.

00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:36.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we must do our best

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:39.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you must do your best
to improve in your teaching.

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:41.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can you do that?

00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:45.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
By imitating the Great Teacher.

00:04:45.312 --> 00:04:49.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this talk
(even though much of what we will talk about

00:04:49.316 --> 00:04:52.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
will concern the public ministry),

00:04:52.194 --> 00:04:54.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’re going to discuss (much of it)

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:58.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be applicable
to teaching on a personal level

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the congregation.

00:05:00.744 --> 00:05:04.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
So especially you brothers (but all of us),

00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:07.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
want to imitate Jesus’ teaching methods

00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:12.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we shepherd Jehovah’s sheep
on a personal level

00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:15.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as we do so on a congregational level

00:05:15.635 --> 00:05:18.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the platform.

00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:20.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a question:

00:05:20.098 --> 00:05:24.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus become the Great Teacher?

00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:28.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible tells us
that for aeons and aeons of time,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a master worker” beside Jehovah,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
he carefully observed
and he imitated his Father.

00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:41.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he thereby acquired
amazing teaching skills.

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:43.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned from the greatest Teacher.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no wonder he became the Great Teacher.

00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned from his heavenly Father,

00:05:48.877 --> 00:05:52.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he appropriately gave credit
where it belongs.

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:56.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go to John chapter 8, please,

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice how he gave the credit for his

00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:02.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking and teaching where it belongs.

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 8 and the <i>B</i>  part of verse 28:

00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:10.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I do nothing of my own initiative;

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but just as the Father taught me,

00:06:13.736 --> 00:06:16.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
I speak these things.”

00:06:16.822 --> 00:06:19.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he imitated his Father.

00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:21.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we want to imitate him.

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what specific teaching methods

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:29.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
did he utilize and did he learn
from the greatest Teacher?

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s discuss four.

00:06:31.087 --> 00:06:35.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one, he taught with enthusiasm

00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:37.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conviction.

00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:39.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 7:29:

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:41.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he was teaching them

00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a person having authority,

00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:47.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not as their scribes.”

00:06:47.854 --> 00:06:50.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
So doesn’t that indicate
enthusiasm, conviction,

00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:52.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
and authority is what he taught?

00:06:52.442 --> 00:06:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we’re not enthusiastic
about what we teach

00:06:56.947 --> 00:06:59.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ministry or from the platform,

00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:04.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
how could we expect our listeners
to be enthusiastic about it?

00:07:04.246 --> 00:07:08.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
So never would we want
to come across halfhearted in our teaching.

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like enthusiastic teaching
is contagious,

00:07:12.963 --> 00:07:15.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
halfhearted teaching
is contagious too, isn’t it?

00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:18.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could perhaps liken it to yawning.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
One person yawns in a room,
and pretty soon everybody is yawning.

00:07:22.848 --> 00:07:25.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that could be the way
with halfhearted teaching.

00:07:25.643 --> 00:07:28.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as a caution, we don’t want to be

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:31.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
theatrical in our speaking.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means
we wouldn’t want to use extreme gestures

00:07:34.652 --> 00:07:38.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
or dramatic expressions

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
—overly theatrical or even theatrical.

00:07:41.867 --> 00:07:43.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:45.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because now you end up drawing
attention to yourself

00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:48.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
—don’t you?—
rather than to what you’re teaching.

00:07:48.416 --> 00:07:52.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s emphasis in the wrong place,
isn’t it?

00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:57.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s talk about a second method
the Great Teacher utilized.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a good listener.

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:04.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did he learn this pattern
of being a good listener?

00:08:04.057 --> 00:08:08.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, open up to Isaiah chapter 50, please,

00:08:08.228 --> 00:08:11.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice what is prophetically said
about Jesus

00:08:11.898 --> 00:08:15.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where he learned to be a good listener.

00:08:15.402 --> 00:08:19.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in chapter 50
and right at the end of verse 4.

00:08:19.948 --> 00:08:22.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin there: “He [Jehovah]

00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“awakens my ear to listen

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the taught ones.

00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:32.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Sovereign Lord Jehovah
has opened my ear,

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I was not rebellious.

00:08:34.254 --> 00:08:37.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did not turn in the opposite direction.”

00:08:37.674 --> 00:08:40.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah opened his ear,

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:44.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
trained him to be a good listener,
and he responded well, did he not?

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why when he became a human,

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:50.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
from childhood on,

00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:54.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
he continued his pattern
of being a good listener, didn’t he?

00:08:54.275 --> 00:08:57.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall the account in Luke chapter 2

00:08:57.528 --> 00:09:00.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus

00:09:00.114 --> 00:09:03.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
after three days
when he was only 12 years old?

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did they find him?

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:08.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that he was “sitting in the midst
of the teachers” there in the temple

00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:11.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listening to them

00:09:11.542 --> 00:09:14.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then also asking them questions.

00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:19.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when he began his career
as a disciple-maker at age 30,

00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:23.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was second nature—wasn’t it?—
to be a good listener.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:27.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think of this:
Even though he had more to say

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
than any other human has ever had to say,

00:09:30.896 --> 00:09:35.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knew the value of pausing,
drawing out his audience,

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:39.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then really listening to them.

00:09:39.488 --> 00:09:41.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same is true with us.

00:09:41.698 --> 00:09:46.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may think especially after Gilead School
that you’ve got a lot to say.

00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:48.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’re going to imitate
the Great Teacher,

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to use self-control.

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to pause and draw people out

00:09:53.752 --> 00:09:56.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then really listen to them.

00:09:56.463 --> 00:10:00.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we serve as an assistant,
which sometimes is half the time,

00:10:00.217 --> 00:10:03.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to be active listeners.

00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:06.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean
(to be an active listener)?

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:11.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe
you would nod periodically in agreement.

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:15.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe you would add some little comment,
such as, “Well, that’s very interesting.”

00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:18.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might even ask for clarification.

00:10:18.653 --> 00:10:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
People like to clarify what they’re saying.

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:23.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows you’re really interested
in what’s happening.

00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:26.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whether we’re the one presenting

00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:30.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the one who is an assistant,
we want to be an active listener.

00:10:30.456 --> 00:10:33.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s probably nothing more distracting

00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:38.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
than having your assistant
playing with the dog

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:41.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe looking down the street
to see what’s happening down the street.

00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:44.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pretty soon, your householder is looking down
the street to see what’s happening.

00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:49.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be an active listener.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s get our third method
the Great Teacher used.

00:10:53.605 --> 00:10:57.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used thought-provoking questions.

00:10:57.359 --> 00:10:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
And methods two and three do go hand in hand
—don’t they?—

00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you ask good questions,

00:11:01.905 --> 00:11:05.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re likely
going to have more to listen to.

00:11:05.826 --> 00:11:10.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if some of Jehovah’s people
tend to shy away,

00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:12.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps, from using questions?

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:14.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if they just like to present information

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind of control everything?

00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:21.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you think about it, it’s probably
easier just to present information

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though it’s not nearly as effective.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you ask questions

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:30.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you get a response
from the householder,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s kind of like bouncing a football.

00:11:33.938 --> 00:11:38.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you bounce a basketball, it’s
predictable—isn’t it?—but not a football.

00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:40.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s the same way with people.

00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:42.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
They come back with all kinds of responses,

00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:45.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve got to be willing and able

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:47.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adapt according to their responses.

00:11:47.452 --> 00:11:51.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some don’t like that uncertainty, so they
would rather just present information.

00:11:51.498 --> 00:11:55.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we said,
that’s not going to be nearly as effective

00:11:55.752 --> 00:11:59.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
as those who have learned
to imitate the Great Teacher

00:11:59.714 --> 00:12:03.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and effectively teach with questions.

00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:06.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you Gilead students

00:12:06.012 --> 00:12:10.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
have certainly seen the value
of good questions during class.

00:12:10.392 --> 00:12:13.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made it so much more enjoyable
—didn’t it?—

00:12:13.437 --> 00:12:16.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it enhanced your learning tremendously

00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:20.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
when your instructors
used these good questions.

00:12:20.068 --> 00:12:23.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that more effective,

00:12:23.364 --> 00:12:25.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proficiently use questions?

00:12:25.741 --> 00:12:28.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
you involve your listener

00:12:28.786 --> 00:12:30.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the conversation.

00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:32.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you enjoy more?

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being given a sermon
or being involved in a conversation?

00:12:36.377 --> 00:12:38.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is obvious, isn’t it?

00:12:38.003 --> 00:12:40.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
So involve the listener.
It’s more enjoyable.

00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:45.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing is that you gain
valuable information about your listener,

00:12:45.303 --> 00:12:48.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
which you can use to really help that one.

00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:52.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what are types of questions we can use?

00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:55.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can use “what do you think” questions.

00:12:55.438 --> 00:12:57.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used them.

00:12:57.482 --> 00:13:01.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
As an example, Matthew 18:12:

00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:03.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you think?

00:13:03.571 --> 00:13:06.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a man has 100 sheep
and one of them strays . . . ”

00:13:06.408 --> 00:13:07.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we know the rest of the illustration.

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:09.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he started out with: “What do you think?”

00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:12.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people generally
like to give their opinion

00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in a sense, there’s no wrong answer
—is there?—

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:18.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
because whatever they say,
that’s what they think.

00:13:18.712 --> 00:13:20.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what you asked for, right?

00:13:20.422 --> 00:13:22.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
You asked, “What do you think?”

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people like to give their opinion.

00:13:25.594 --> 00:13:26.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes it enjoyable.

00:13:26.928 --> 00:13:31.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can also use multiple-choice questions.

00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:35.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sometimes makes it easier
for the householder to answer.

00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:40.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus gave an example in Matthew 17:25.

00:13:40.484 --> 00:13:45.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “[Simon,]
from whom do the kings of the earth

00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:48.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“receive duties or head tax?

00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:52.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
From their sons or from the strangers?”

00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:56.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our tracts use multiple-choice
questions—don’t they?—

00:13:56.292 --> 00:13:59.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can effectively use those.

00:13:59.003 --> 00:14:01.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it, the right question

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:04.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often enable us

00:14:04.258 --> 00:14:07.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome potential conversation stoppers

00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:09.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep the conversation going.

00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:14.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, if a person says,
“You people don’t believe in Jesus,”

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might say: “Well, may I please ask,
why do you say that?

00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:22.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did someone tell you that about us?”

00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:25.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Harmless questions
can keep that conversation going

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:28.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
until you get valuable information

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:30.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps you can use to help the person.

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person says,
“I don’t believe in the Bible.”

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:38.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May I please ask why you feel that way?

00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:41.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
May I ask how long you have felt that way?”

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep it going.

00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:45.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother said that during pioneer school

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:48.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had those questions drilled into his head:

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why do you feel that way?

00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:52.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long have you felt that way?”

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:56.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman came to the door and said,
“I can’t talk; I’m pregnant.”

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:59.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “Well, may I ask
how long you’ve felt that way?”

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t do that.

00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like we said before,
you’ve got to be a good listener.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:13.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then what about using
thought-provoking questions

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
when conducting a Bible study?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you well know, our new study book

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:23.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
is loaded with thought-provoking questions
—isn’t it?—

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we certainly want to fully utilize them.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:30.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
But occasionally
we may need to add auxiliary questions.

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:34.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, most of what
a good teacher says during a Bible study

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:38.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in the form of questions.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:42.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know for myself,
I’ve really tried hard to train myself

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’m about ready to make a statement,
say something.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Wait a minute; let me change that.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:50.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Let me change it to a question,

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:55.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let me draw out from the student
what I was about to say.’

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:58.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s going to be more effective, isn’t it?

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s normally much better

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
than explaining a scripture

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a student to have
the student explain it to you.

00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:12.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t be afraid of a little silence.

00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:16.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you ask a question and there is silence,

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:20.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of us think that we have to quickly fill
in the gap by saying something.

00:16:20.106 --> 00:16:23.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if they’re thinking, let them think.

00:16:23.818 --> 00:16:26.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you have to know your student.

00:16:26.237 --> 00:16:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they have no clue what the answer is,

00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
then don’t let them
just sit there and sizzle.

00:16:32.285 --> 00:16:33.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throw them a rope.

00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:37.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throw them an auxiliary question.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we’re going
to go to our fourth method

00:16:41.753 --> 00:16:44.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Great Teacher learned
from the greatest Teacher:

00:16:44.714 --> 00:16:49.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
He effectively used illustrations.

00:16:49.135 --> 00:16:53.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was certainly
a powerful teaching tool indeed.

00:16:53.264 --> 00:16:55.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 13:34:

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Without an illustration

00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:00.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Jesus] would not speak.”

00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:03.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s a question:

00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:06.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that Jesus’ illustrations

00:17:06.778 --> 00:17:09.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
were the product
of spur-of-the-moment thinking?

00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:12.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s no doubt about it
that his perfect brain certainly helped

00:17:12.743 --> 00:17:15.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to come up
with amazing illustrations.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
But nevertheless, the indication is

00:17:17.706 --> 00:17:20.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he cultivated the ability

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:23.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
to effectively use illustrations.

00:17:23.462 --> 00:17:27.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he saw a shepherd, for example,
taking care of his sheep,

00:17:27.841 --> 00:17:32.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
he likely meditated,
‘Now, how can I use this situation

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:34.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach vital truths?’

00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:39.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did the same when he saw, for example,
a fisherman letting down his nets,

00:17:39.854 --> 00:17:42.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
a farmer sowing seed,

00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:46.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe builders constructing a tower.

00:17:46.444 --> 00:17:49.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can I use this

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make powerful illustrations
that teach vital truths?’

00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:55.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with simple items

00:17:55.578 --> 00:18:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
like birds, lilies, a lamp on a lampstand,

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:05.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
a wineskin, leaven, a mustard seed,
salt, the young child

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:08.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
he thought, ‘How can I use these simple items

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:10.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach vital truths?’

00:18:10.135 --> 00:18:12.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was amazing how he did that.

00:18:12.887 --> 00:18:14.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same is true with us.

00:18:14.222 --> 00:18:18.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
All around us, if we train ourselves
to think that way,

00:18:18.018 --> 00:18:21.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are circumstances,
there are situations,

00:18:21.521 --> 00:18:25.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are even items that we can use

00:18:25.025 --> 00:18:28.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them into powerful illustrations.

00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:31.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can powerfully elevate
the quality of our teaching.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s an example.

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time ago,
a brother noticed a little baby

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a pacifier.

00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:42.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pacifier had been dipped in sugar water
and put in the baby’s mouth.

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:46.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was thinking:
‘You know, that’s a very good illustration

00:18:46.922 --> 00:18:50.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘of many, many in Christendom.

00:18:50.009 --> 00:18:53.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They’re satisfied with what they have,

00:18:53.095 --> 00:18:57.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘even though they have
no real spiritual nourishment.

00:18:57.266 --> 00:19:00.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But we’re looking for those
who are not satisfied,

00:19:00.895 --> 00:19:04.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are conscious
of their spiritual need.’

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was able to use that in a talk.

00:19:06.526 --> 00:19:10.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are cautions
regarding the use of illustrations?

00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:12.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are just a couple.

00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:17.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
An illustration
should not be too long or complicated.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it is, simplify it or discard it.

00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:24.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the <i>School Guidebook</i>  tells us.

00:19:24.794 --> 00:19:28.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another caution: To be effective,

00:19:28.256 --> 00:19:31.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
the illustration must be familiar to

00:19:31.843 --> 00:19:34.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fit your audience.

00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:37.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
what if you used the illustration

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan’s system is like a male platypus?

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:46.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in some parts of Australia,
that might be a good illustration

00:19:46.525 --> 00:19:49.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they know a male platypus

00:19:49.194 --> 00:19:52.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks harmless, he looks innocent,

00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his hind legs are armed with ankle spurs

00:19:55.576 --> 00:19:57.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
connected to venom glands.

00:19:57.953 --> 00:20:01.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he looks harmless,
but he could be very dangerous.

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:05.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that only works if you’re dealing
with people that are familiar

00:20:05.544 --> 00:20:08.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that particular animal.

00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:11.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
But skillfully selected and used,

00:20:11.425 --> 00:20:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrations are very effective.

00:20:14.303 --> 00:20:16.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stimulate thinking,

00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:19.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
they arrest and hold attention,

00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:22.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
they motivate the heart and conscience
of our listener,

00:20:22.937 --> 00:20:25.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they serve as powerful memory aids.

00:20:25.982 --> 00:20:28.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good illustration

00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:30.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be remembered years later

00:20:30.445 --> 00:20:32.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with (and this is the important thing)

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
a point that it was designed to highlight.

00:20:37.994 --> 00:20:41.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have four teaching methods

00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:43.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
utilized by the Great Teacher

00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:47.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he learned from the greatest Teacher,
as we said.

00:20:47.128 --> 00:20:52.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to do our best to copy,
or imitate, his way of teaching.

00:20:52.134 --> 00:20:56.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know you Gilead students
have an enhanced desire to do that

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation
and also in your territory

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’re going to be working in.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s work hard

00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:09.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach with enthusiasm and conviction,

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:12.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s be a good listener,

00:21:12.655 --> 00:21:15.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s use thought-provoking questions,

00:21:15.824 --> 00:21:19.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s use effective illustrations.

00:21:19.662 --> 00:21:23.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you work hard,
you dear students, almost graduates,

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:26.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
to employ these same teaching techniques,

00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:29.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you’re going to be a lot more skillful

00:21:29.422 --> 00:21:32.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
in reaching the hearts of your listeners.

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:34.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a lot at stake, isn’t it?

00:21:34.552 --> 00:21:38.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, if you think about it, the lives
of our brothers and sisters are at stake.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the “art of teaching”
learned from the Great Teacher,

00:21:42.894 --> 00:21:45.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to help as many of them as we can

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make it into that new world.

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:52.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then also the lives of honesthearted ones
in our territory

00:21:52.403 --> 00:21:55.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
hang in the balance, don’t they?

00:21:55.198 --> 00:21:59.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to find them before it’s too late.

00:21:59.202 --> 00:22:02.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
And using the art of teaching
learned from the Great Teacher,

00:22:02.998 --> 00:22:07.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to motivate them
to come into the safety

00:22:07.127 --> 00:22:09.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,
it’s good to remember

00:22:12.466 --> 00:22:16.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what we’re doing now
in the way of learning to teach

00:22:16.386 --> 00:22:18.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really preparing us

00:22:18.972 --> 00:22:22.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the greatest teaching campaign

00:22:22.142 --> 00:22:26.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever in all human history
—the teaching of billions

00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:29.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will be coming back in the resurrection.

00:22:29.483 --> 00:22:32.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say our work now
is like a warm-up, isn’t it?

00:22:32.528 --> 00:22:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a warm-up
for that greatest teaching campaign

00:22:36.699 --> 00:22:40.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is just around the corner.

00:22:40.453 --> 00:22:44.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please continue to observe carefully

00:22:44.457 --> 00:22:46.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
the teaching of the Great Teacher,

00:22:46.417 --> 00:22:49.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you learned a lot about that in school,
no doubt about it.

00:22:49.128 --> 00:22:51.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may Jehovah continue

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:56.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bless you most beloved
Gilead students, almost graduates.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
May he bless you as you apply

00:22:59.764 --> 00:23:03.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the wonderful things
you’ve learned during this school,

00:23:03.518 --> 00:23:06.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that includes learning

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:09.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
to imitate the Great Teacher.

00:23:12.319 --> 00:23:15.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we sincerely thank you, Brother Lett,

00:23:15.405 --> 00:23:19.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those very practical comments
about learning to be a good teacher.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very, very much appreciated.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now is the time
for us to present the diplomas.

00:23:30.212 --> 00:23:31.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Kenneth Flodin,

00:23:31.964 --> 00:23:34.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,
is going to assist.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to do the hard part
—mentioning all the names.

00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:43.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first couple here is
Brother and Sister Agostinho,

00:23:43.183 --> 00:23:45.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re going back to the Angola branch.

00:23:58.866 --> 00:24:02.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is Brother Ansong
going back to the Britain branch.

00:24:10.169 --> 00:24:13.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have diplomas
for both Brother and Sister Arto

00:24:13.339 --> 00:24:15.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
going to the Spain branch.

00:24:22.182 --> 00:24:25.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Brown
are being assigned

00:24:25.894 --> 00:24:27.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Japan branch.

00:24:36.655 --> 00:24:39.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother and Sister Devine
are going to remain here in the United States

00:24:39.825 --> 00:24:41.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve at the branch.

00:24:50.502 --> 00:24:53.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Kandji
return to the Cameroon branch.

00:25:00.846 --> 00:25:03.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is Brother and Sister Kauppinen,

00:25:03.057 --> 00:25:05.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ll be returning
and serving at the Finland branch.

00:25:13.317 --> 00:25:16.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Knaus
return to the Canada branch.

00:25:23.911 --> 00:25:25.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
These people look familiar.

00:25:26.664 --> 00:25:29.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Kunda return to Zambia.

00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:38.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And two more familiar ones here.

00:25:38.134 --> 00:25:41.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Lee go back to Micronesia.

00:25:48.979 --> 00:25:52.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Lin
will be going back to the Taiwan branch.

00:26:00.365 --> 00:26:05.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we have Brother and Sister Mabunda
going back to Mozambique.

00:26:11.835 --> 00:26:16.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother and Sister Matanda
will be returning to Zimbabwe.

00:26:17.633 --> 00:26:21.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Matanda had a medical situation,

00:26:21.053 --> 00:26:23.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sadly, he’s not able to be with us today.

00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:26.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he will be getting his diploma, OK?

00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:40.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mazmanyan
will return to Armenia.

00:26:47.747 --> 00:26:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Moraru
will be going back to Romania.

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:02.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is Brother Mukumbi
returning to Zimbabwe.

00:27:08.602 --> 00:27:11.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother and Sister Peter
are going to return to Fiji

00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:13.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve at the branch there.

00:27:20.113 --> 00:27:25.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Roch are going
to return to the Czech-Slovak branch.

00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:32.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is Brother and Sister Saladino.

00:27:32.668 --> 00:27:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re going to remain in the United States
and serve at the branch.

00:27:44.138 --> 00:27:48.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Simon
are going to return, spiritually well-fed,

00:27:48.768 --> 00:27:50.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Hungary branch.

00:27:58.194 --> 00:28:00.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Brother Vanbastolaer.

00:28:00.613 --> 00:28:02.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going back to Tahiti.

00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:12.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful class!

00:28:12.083 --> 00:28:15.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t you think Brother Flodin did well
with all of those names?

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it gives me very great pleasure
to introduce you now

00:28:26.598 --> 00:28:31.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the graduates
of the 153rd class of Gilead.

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:55.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Janne Kauppinen
is going to read a letter from the class.

00:29:01.592 --> 00:29:05.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To the Governing Body:

00:29:05.555 --> 00:29:08.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dear brothers,

00:29:08.182 --> 00:29:12.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the end of five memorable months,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we feel moved to echo

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:17.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the words of 1 John 4:16:

00:29:17.942 --> 00:29:22.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘We have come to know and believe
the love that God has for us.’

00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:27.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One way we experienced this love
was by your fine example

00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:30.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as well as that of your helpers.

00:29:30.872 --> 00:29:33.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We did not expect and will never forget

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:37.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you sacrificing
your precious time and energy

00:29:37.129 --> 00:29:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to provide us lectures,
interviews, and even tours.

00:29:41.758 --> 00:29:44.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a result,
we learned firsthand

00:29:44.803 --> 00:29:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from your love, humility,
and burning zeal for Jehovah.

00:29:51.351 --> 00:29:54.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our course of intensive Bible study

00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:56.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has deepened our appreciation

00:29:56.732 --> 00:29:59.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the timely and upbuilding spiritual food

00:29:59.902 --> 00:30:02.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“available to all of God’s people.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are also deeply grateful to you

00:30:05.866 --> 00:30:10.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for providing us
with selfless and skillful instructors.

00:30:10.538 --> 00:30:15.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These ‘gifts in men’
imparted their souls to us each day

00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:19.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and regularly made our hearts burn
with appreciation.

00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:26.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Carefully considering
the entire Bible chronologically

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:31.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has given us a deeper understanding
of how Jehovah thinks.

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:36.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It has also increased
our sensitivity to how he feels.

00:30:37.273 --> 00:30:40.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our in-depth consideration
of Jesus’ ministry

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“made us eyewitnesses to God’s love
being revealed through him.

00:30:46.658 --> 00:30:50.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We learned
that the opposite of love is selfishness.

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:54.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We can only show
genuine, unselfish concern for others

00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:56.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the help of holy spirit.

00:30:56.877 --> 00:30:59.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such selfless love empowers us

00:30:59.379 --> 00:31:03.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to bring out the best
in ourselves and others.

00:31:03.675 --> 00:31:06.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We experienced this in action

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through the warm hospitality
and overwhelming kindness

00:31:10.057 --> 00:31:12.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“shown by the United States Bethel family,

00:31:12.976 --> 00:31:15.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who ‘abound in love for one another’

00:31:15.729 --> 00:31:17.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and for all.

00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:22.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This beautiful family
has a permanent place in each of our hearts.

00:31:26.407 --> 00:31:30.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you for the priceless gift
of Gilead training.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we leave Patterson,
we are resolved to live

00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:39.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the words of 1 John 4:11:

00:31:39.128 --> 00:31:41.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If this is how God loved us,

00:31:41.589 --> 00:31:45.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then we are also under obligation
to love one another.’

00:31:48.012 --> 00:31:53.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are determined to never forget
what we saw and heard.

00:31:57.272 --> 00:31:59.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gilead
—excuse me—

00:31:59.774 --> 00:32:03.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gilead has changed our desire and ability

00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:07.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to serve Jehovah
and our brothers better each day,

00:32:07.783 --> 00:32:09.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“stabilizing Jehovah’s organization

00:32:09.951 --> 00:32:12.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one precious sheep at a time.

00:32:12.954 --> 00:32:15.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We love you, dear brothers.

00:32:18.544 --> 00:32:23.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your brothers and sisters,
153rd Gilead Class.”

00:32:35.394 --> 00:32:37.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at the outset of our program,

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discussed the initial reluctance

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:45.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Gideon and Moses

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:48.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jeremiah and Brother Booth

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:51.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept assignments.

00:32:51.452 --> 00:32:55.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the final analysis,
they all followed through

00:32:55.581 --> 00:32:59.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they did
what Jehovah commissioned them to do.

00:33:00.503 --> 00:33:03.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to imitate them.

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:08.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to trust
that if Jehovah is allowing us to serve,

00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:12.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we might feel very, very inadequate,

00:33:12.474 --> 00:33:15.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
he sees something good in us.

00:33:15.101 --> 00:33:19.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’ll make up for any lack that we feel.

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:23.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s a caution:

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:26.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never go to the other extreme.

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:29.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never become overconfident

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:34.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and step beyond
the authority that you may be given.

00:33:35.247 --> 00:33:37.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in this regard,
there’s an interesting account

00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:41.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I want
to just very briefly share with you.

00:33:41.754 --> 00:33:45.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s in 2 Kings chapter 14

00:33:47.551 --> 00:33:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Kings chapter 14.

00:33:51.013 --> 00:33:54.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you’re turning there,

00:33:54.266 --> 00:33:58.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this account,
we read about King Amaziah of Judah.

00:33:58.312 --> 00:34:00.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he had experienced

00:34:00.314 --> 00:34:03.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
a great victory over the Edomites,

00:34:03.901 --> 00:34:08.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now
he wanted to go to war against Israel.

00:34:08.823 --> 00:34:13.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
But King Jehoash
sent him a few words of advice.

00:34:14.704 --> 00:34:17.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I want you to just read these words,
these few words,

00:34:17.749 --> 00:34:20.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially draw attention
to one sentence.

00:34:20.043 --> 00:34:21.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
So would you read it with me?

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:24.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Kings 14:10,

00:34:25.882 --> 00:34:30.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said:
“True, you have struck down Edom,

00:34:30.762 --> 00:34:33.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
so your heart has become arrogant.”

00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:34.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the point.

00:34:34.432 --> 00:34:37.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the sentence
I want you to draw attention to:

00:34:37.727 --> 00:34:41.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Enjoy your glory
 but stay in your own house.”

00:34:43.442 --> 00:34:45.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a great line?

00:34:45.193 --> 00:34:47.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to read it one more time.

00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Enjoy your glory,

00:34:50.073 --> 00:34:52.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but stay in your own house.

00:34:52.826 --> 00:34:56.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why should you provoke disaster and fall,

00:34:56.413 --> 00:34:58.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing Judah down with you?”

00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:00.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:35:00.709 --> 00:35:04.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Jehoash said to Amaziah:
‘Enjoy the victory.

00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:06.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yeah, you won a victory.
Enjoy it.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t get a big head.

00:35:08.092 --> 00:35:10.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t push it.

00:35:10.094 --> 00:35:12.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay in your own house.’

00:35:12.304 --> 00:35:14.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some Bible translations say “stay at home.”

00:35:16.225 --> 00:35:17.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as it turned out—

00:35:17.685 --> 00:35:21.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know, you’re Gilead graduates;
you know how it turned out.

00:35:21.772 --> 00:35:25.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amaziah did not listen to that advice.

00:35:25.193 --> 00:35:27.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went on to fight against Israel,

00:35:27.737 --> 00:35:31.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a result,
he suffered a humiliating defeat.

00:35:32.367 --> 00:35:33.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:35:34.827 --> 00:35:39.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have had
a wonderful spiritual victory today.

00:35:39.874 --> 00:35:44.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is no doubt going to be
one of the happiest days of your entire life

00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:48.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
—graduating from Gilead School.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s right
that you should enjoy this day.

00:35:51.011 --> 00:35:53.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should find so much pleasure in it

00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:58.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel satisfaction
in what you’ve accomplished.

00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:00.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as you experience this joy

00:36:00.854 --> 00:36:03.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the future as you experience the joy

00:36:03.523 --> 00:36:07.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
of taking on new assignments
that will come to you,

00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:09.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoy the moment.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
But stay in your place.

00:36:11.824 --> 00:36:16.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never go beyond the limits
of your responsibility

00:36:16.036 --> 00:36:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the authority that you’ve been given.

00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:22.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
No assignment ever gives us the license

00:36:22.042 --> 00:36:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to think that we are somehow superior

00:36:24.712 --> 00:36:27.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our brothers or to act in that way.

00:36:27.882 --> 00:36:29.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, no doubt one of the qualities

00:36:29.967 --> 00:36:34.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah saw in all of you
is your humility

00:36:34.889 --> 00:36:39.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
—your ability to consider others
as superior to you

00:36:39.227 --> 00:36:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to treat them in that way.

00:36:42.438 --> 00:36:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep that quality,
and even strengthen it.

00:36:47.026 --> 00:36:51.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
some who disregarded cautions like this

00:36:51.322 --> 00:36:53.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who succumbed to pride

00:36:53.533 --> 00:36:57.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
have, like Amaziah,
eventually suffered a painful defeat.

00:36:58.913 --> 00:37:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yes,
this has been an especially happy day,

00:37:03.919 --> 00:37:06.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you have many reasons to rejoice in it.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as you go
