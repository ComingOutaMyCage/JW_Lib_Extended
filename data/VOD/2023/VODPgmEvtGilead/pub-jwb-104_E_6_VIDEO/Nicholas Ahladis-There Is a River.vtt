00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:06.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, earthquakes
have been in the news quite a bit recently.

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:10.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re going to read
about an earthquake in Psalm 46,

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:15.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
which describes one
that has never happened in recorded history

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 46, starting with verse 1.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says there:
“God is our refuge and strength,

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a help that is readily found
in times of distress.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why we will not fear,
though the earth undergoes change

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or, some translations say,
“though the earth quakes”],

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:44.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“though the mountains topple
into the depths of the sea,

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“though its waters roar and foam over,

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
though the mountains rock
on account of its turbulence.”

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s no evidence
that this poetic description

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
of mountains toppling into the sea

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally happened in ancient Israel.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
But clearly the world around the psalmist

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
seemed to be collapsing somehow.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
What catastrophic situation
is being referred to?

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i>
has explained that this psalm

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to fit the time of King Hezekiah

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:20.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jerusalem
was being threatened by Sennacherib,

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king of Assyria.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know those threats were not empty.

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sennacherib had conquered
surrounding nations.

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had also conquered
the fortified cities around Jerusalem

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were protecting the city.

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’d actually overrun the villages
right up to Nob,

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Nob was within sight of Jerusalem
—one mile (1.5 km) away.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, as you know,
Assyria was famous for its cruelty.

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve found palace walls
from Sennacherib’s time

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
that show shocking scenes of brutality

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward conquered peoples.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can understand why

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
the psalmist felt the world was collapsing.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
The description is so ominous and bleak.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suddenly, in verse 4,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tone of the psalm changes completely.

00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is a river the streams of which

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“make the city of God rejoice,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the holy grand tabernacle of the Most High.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is in the city; it cannot be overthrown.

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:32.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
God will come to its aid
at the break of dawn.”

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the psalmist’s thoughts
go from catastrophe and chaos

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:39.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
to peace and confidence.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 4 speaks
about “a river” in “the city of God.”

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no river flowing in Jerusalem.

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is this referring to?

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, some suggest that it refers
to Hezekiah’s Tunnel,

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was built
in order to bring water into the city.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:59.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the poetic structure of the psalm

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually parallels the river

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the holy tabernacle of Jehovah

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:09.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the holy tabernacle of the Most High—
and the pure worship carried on there.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s interesting that when Hezekiah

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
received the threats from Sennacherib,

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Scriptures say in 2 Kings 19

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Hezekiah
took the letters from the Assyrians,

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
he went into the temple,
he spread them out before Jehovah,

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he prayed fervently.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jehovah
sent a reassuring message through Isaiah:

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have heard your prayer to me
concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria. . . .

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will not come into [the] city

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or shoot an arrow there or [bring] a shield

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
or . . . siege rampart against it.”

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the sons of Korah,
who recorded this psalm,

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:53.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have seen Hezekiah going into the temple

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:56.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then heard
Jehovah’s response through Isaiah.

00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this would give them
complete confidence in the outcome.

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:03.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all know what happened next.

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:05.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
The huge Assyrian army

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:09.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
was vanquished overnight by an angel.

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it could be that verse 5 alludes to this,

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:16.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says: “God will come to its aid
at the break of dawn.”

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does this psalm teach us?

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the psalmist’s example

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:25.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
of focusing on pure worship and His Word,

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is likened to a river in this psalm,

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:31.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows that we can experience peace

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when the world around us
seems to be collapsing.

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist declared: “God is in the city.”

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was its Ruler—not Sennacherib!

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:44.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades, Judah had been wayward

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:47.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and God was not in Jerusalem.

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:49.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Hezekiah renovated the temple

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restored pure worship there.

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:56.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
That pure worship
was like a river of blessing

00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:58.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
that connected the people to Jehovah

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave powerful evidence
that God was in the city.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our <i>Pure Worship</i>  book
associates the river of Psalm 46

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the river that flowed

00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:13.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s sanctuary in Ezekiel’s vision.

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:15.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you might recall that that river

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:20.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
became wider and deeper
the further it flowed.

00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:22.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Pure Worship</i>  book says about it:

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:26.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like the visionary river that Ezekiel saw,

00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:30.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
the flow of pure truths
has expanded rapidly.”

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:33.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today the flow of that river
includes Bibles,

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:36.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible-based publications, and videos

00:05:36.648 --> 00:05:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
in over a thousand languages.

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:42.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezekiel said that the river got so deep

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a person had to swim.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the last five months,

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
you students have felt like Ezekiel.

00:05:50.078 --> 00:05:54.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your course has immersed you
and sometimes taken you underwater.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was
from the flood of Bible knowledge

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:03.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
you received
through your study, your lectures,

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:05.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also the interaction

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the students and your instructors.

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:13.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you may have felt
like you were even drowning sometimes.

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:15.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Hezekiah and those with him,

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve also been
in the confines of a secure city

00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:23.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s worship prevails.

00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:26.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
During these months,
the world has been dealing

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the aftermath of the pandemic
and wars and other disasters.

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you were like the psalmist:

00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:36.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
The earth could quake,
the mountains could topple;

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:39.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you enjoyed a special period of peace

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:41.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you were focused on that river.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re going back out into the trenches

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:48.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the rest of us, so to speak.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:53.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you will serve
where there’s economic turmoil

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:56.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
or violence or other disasters,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you may personally face health trials,
even persecution.

00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the lesson of Gilead
and the lesson of Psalm 46

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:06.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
can serve you well.

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:11.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you stay focused on “the river,”
Jehovah’s pure worship,

00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:14.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can remain confident and joyful

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:17.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of what challenges life brings.

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:20.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
An ancient Greek writer said:

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:24.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No man ever steps in the same river twice.

00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:29.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
For it’s not the same river,
and he’s not the same man.”

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:32.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true that our lives
are constantly changing

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and new challenges suddenly crop up?

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:38.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s river of blessings

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:41.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
just keeps flowing and is constantly renewed.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
It supplies life-giving water

00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:46.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all circumstances.

00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:50.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is so even when
the figurative mountains of this world

00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:53.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
are toppling and the world is in chaos.

00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:58.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister in the war zone
in eastern Ukraine wrote:

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What we needed most was spiritual food.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were overwhelmed with joy
when we received the JW Boxes

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(after the Internet failed)
and spiritual food

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:12.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“became available again.

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:15.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Despite many challenges and difficulties,

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:17.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when we meet with fellow believers,

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our problems
are not the main subject of discussion.

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:25.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“More often, we share
how Jehovah supports us,

00:08:25.317 --> 00:08:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
what has strengthened us,
and what we’re thankful for.”

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:31.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can sense her calmness.

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:34.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
These friends are living examples

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:36.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how focusing on “the river”

00:08:36.453 --> 00:08:41.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
can preserve our peace
even in times of disaster.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:45.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, returning to Psalm 46,

00:08:45.837 --> 00:08:48.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can paraphrase verses 8 and 9,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
which may have occurred when the angel

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:54.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
destroyed the Assyrian army.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:58.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: ‘Jehovah has done
astonishing things on the earth

00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:00.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—bringing an end to wars,

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:05.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
breaking the bow and the spear,
and burning the military wagons.’

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can just imagine the astonishing scene:

00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:11.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
going out into the Assyrian camp

00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing the entire army devastated.

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:17.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean for us?

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:20.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we hate the war and violence
that plagues this world

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:24.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and affects our dear brothers,
and we long for it to end.

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:29.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
But until then, understanding that Jehovah
is still in the city

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:34.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
—still in control of his people—
gives us complete confidence.

00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:38.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
No humans, no attack
of an Assyrianlike government,

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
can stop the flow of that river
or shake the city.

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the psalmist concludes in verse 11

00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:51.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the reassuring echo of verse 1:

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:54.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies is with us;

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:59.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of Jacob is a secure refuge for us.”

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:04.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know what
your individual future holds after Gilead

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what assignments you’ll receive,

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:10.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you can be confident
that Jehovah “is in the city.”

00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:12.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s in control.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:15.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember the lesson of Gilead:

00:10:15.177 --> 00:10:17.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay focused on “the river”

00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:21.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the river
that “make[s] the city of God rejoice,”

00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:25.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
the river that will flow throughout eternity.
