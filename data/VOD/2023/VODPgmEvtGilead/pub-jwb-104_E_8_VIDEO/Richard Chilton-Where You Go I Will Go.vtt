00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do the following have in common?

00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:07.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Build an ark.

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Choose 300 men.

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
March around the city seven times.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow this route to the Red Sea.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you figure it out?

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:24.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was providing
his people with direction.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the case of these examples,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes that direction could appear to be,

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:34.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s say, a bit unusual.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not too hard for us
to imagine Noah responding,

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you want me to build a massive ark?”

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Gideon asking,

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just 300 men

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against an army of 135,000

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:51.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
—are you sure?”

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Joshua replying:

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:57.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“March around Jericho seven times

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and just blow our horns?

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s it?”

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Moses saying,

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are we headed to the Red Sea

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I believe
there is a much more direct route

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Promised Land?”

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all could have responded in such ways,

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
but did they?

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s allow the Bible
to help us find the answer

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Genesis chapter 6.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Genesis 6:22,

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that “Noah did according

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to all that God had commanded him.

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:42.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did just so.”

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in the examples we’ve mentioned,

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
they all “did just so.”

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
The direction might not have been
what they expected,

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they humbly made the mental turn,
so to speak,

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they followed the divine guidance
wherever it was taking them.

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because they did,

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
they saved not only themselves

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all those that were with them.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, the one leading them was Jehovah.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by their responsive actions,

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were, in effect, saying to him:

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where you go I will go.”

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what about you dear graduates
here before us today?

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like those faithful ones of old,

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:42.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are not alone in navigating your way.

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is where he has always been

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
—at the helm, guiding his people.

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:54.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only difference is that today

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:56.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is providing direction

00:02:56.447 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his “faithful and discreet slave,”

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is
because of our limited understanding

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at times the direction may appear to be

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
a bit unusual.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nonetheless,
you have followed that direction,

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what it was,
no matter where it was taking you.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for that we want to say, “Thank you.”

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:29.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we want to thank
all of you in our listening audience

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being responsive
toward the direction provided.

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we thank, especially,
you dear Gilead graduates before us today.

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:40.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why?

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because during the five months
that we have spent with you,

00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:46.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw you.

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw how you closely followed
the direction of the faithful slave.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
You “did just so.”

00:03:55.422 --> 00:04:00.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
when presenting your student assignments,

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
you did so in English,

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:06.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though, for most of you,
that was not your mother tongue.

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:10.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when COVID protocols were set in place,

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:12.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw you follow all of them,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they might
have been inconvenient,

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:18.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to keep you
and your classmates healthy.

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:22.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you were given counsel,

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only from your instructors
but from each other,

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:29.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
you expressed gratitude for it

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:32.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and immediately went to work at applying it.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw you grow in your love for one another,

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God’s organization,

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah, and for his Son, Jesus.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:47.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this was a direct result

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your sensitivity

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the direction of the faithful slave.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about after you leave this place?

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if you are assigned back
to your country of origin,

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
you won’t be the same person that left

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:12.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and things may not be the way
you remember them either.

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we have full confidence

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:20.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
that whatever future changes come your way,

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will continue echoing the sentiments

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Moabitess Ruth.

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:32.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall when she was faced with numerous,
intimidating changes

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
what she said to Naomi.

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:39.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her words are recorded for us
in Ruth chapter 1, the book bearing her name,

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 16 and 17:

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ruth said:

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not plead with me to abandon you,

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:51.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to turn back from accompanying you;

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for where you go

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will go,

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:01.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and where you spend the night,
I will spend the night.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Your people will be my people,
and your God my God.

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:10.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Where you die I will die,

00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:13.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and there I will be buried.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:18.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘May Jehovah do so to me
and add to it if anything but death

00:06:18.357 --> 00:06:23.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
should separate me from you.’”

00:06:24.613 --> 00:06:28.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what did all of this
actually mean for Ruth?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant leaving what was familiar to her.

00:06:33.538 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant adopting a people

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:39.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
with beliefs different from hers.

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:41.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant following customs

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could result in her becoming
the wife of someone

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:49.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
she did not choose or did not even know,
for that matter.

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:53.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant never returning
to what she had left behind.

00:06:55.143 --> 00:06:57.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Ruth said to Naomi:

00:06:57.354 --> 00:07:00.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where you go I will go,”

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
she meant with no clauses,
no exceptions, no bargaining.

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was without question.

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:10.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Ruth, these were not just words;

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:13.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was her mindset.

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:17.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the same mindset that Noah,

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:22.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon, Joshua, and Moses had.

00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:25.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like them, if we endeavor

00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:30.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always see the one behind the direction,

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:34.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be able to move
in heart harmony with the chariot

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:39.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not under it,
not behind it, right alongside it.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:44.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, this thought brings back to my mind

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fond memory.

00:07:46.695 --> 00:07:49.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall that when my wife and I
lived in South Africa,

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:54.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
I once observed a flock of birds in motion.

00:07:54.578 --> 00:07:57.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
What species?
I do not know.

00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m sure
they numbered into the thousands.

00:08:01.376 --> 00:08:04.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as they swirled and turned

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a group in unison,

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:10.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was a beautiful,
magnificent sight to behold.

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:15.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s interesting is that scientists think

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:20.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that each bird focuses,
not on the entire flock,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on just a few
of its most nearest neighbors in flight.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
When those near them turn,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
they turn.

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one does this,
creating a sort of harmonious wave effect.

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:40.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:45.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we display
by our speech and actions the mindset:

00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:51.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah,
where you and your slave go I will go,’

00:08:52.302 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
we motivate others near us to do the same.

00:08:57.641 --> 00:09:01.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a change in theocratic direction comes

00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we make the turn,

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:09.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
then our spiritual brothers and sisters
make the turn with us.

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Jehovah’s people turn in sync,
in mid-flight, so to speak,

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a beautiful thing
in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:23.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Noah, Gideon,

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:27.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua, Moses, and Ruth

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
set the pattern for all of us,

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:34.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
now dear graduates,

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:36.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is your turn

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set the pattern for others.

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:43.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you continue to follow closely

00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
the direction provided by Jehovah

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:49.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his faithful slave,

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:53.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
others will see his blessing upon you.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:57.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see how
he is keeping you safe and secure.

00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:02.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see your joy and contentment.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And out of a keen desire
to have that same experience,

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
they too will be motivated to say:

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:13.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where you go I will go.”
