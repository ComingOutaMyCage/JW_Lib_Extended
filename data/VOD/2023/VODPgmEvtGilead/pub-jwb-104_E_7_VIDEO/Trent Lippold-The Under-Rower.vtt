00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is famously the object

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the subject of a Bible account.

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:12.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
We easily sympathize with him

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:17.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we can understand
his emotions and feelings at the time.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, his response

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that which provides a powerful life lesson

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our service to God.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re introduced to him
in the book of Mark chapter 14

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark chapter 14, beginning in verse 50.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 50 picks up the account

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we read of the 11 faithful apostles:

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they all abandoned him and fled.

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, a certain young man

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wearing only a fine linen garment
over his naked body

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“began to follow him nearby,

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they tried to seize him,

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he left his linen garment behind
and got away naked.”

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young man in this verse

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
is understood to be John Mark,

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice John Mark’s outstanding quality.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:21.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostles all fled,

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says John Mark followed “nearby.”

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
What tremendous courage of this young man!

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the great men, the apostles, fled,

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark stayed and he followed nearby.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, interestingly,
we know that Peter eventually also followed.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice this about Peter in verse 54:

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:50.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Peter, from a good distance, followed.”

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark followed nearby.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this we see
not only the courage of John Mark,

00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we also see his devotion to Jesus.

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what extent he knew Jesus

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
or had interactions with Jesus,
we don’t know.

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he did have some.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his devotion and courage for his Master
is unquestionable here.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures also describe Mark, John Mark,

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a strengthening aid”
and “a great comfort.”

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were the observations of him
later in his life.

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do know from the Scriptures
that John Mark

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked in the background
for some very big personalities

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the apostle Paul, the apostle Peter,

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:35.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Barnabas.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark initially caught the attention
of the apostles

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
—of Paul and Barnabas—
when he was in Jerusalem.

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul, or Saul at the time, and Barnabas

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
came there in 46 C.E.

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they took John Mark with them
to the exciting assignment of Antioch,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Christianity was beginning to flourish,

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and John Mark was brought along with them.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:03.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, in the year 47 C.E.,

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:06.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark was selected
to go with Barnabas and Saul

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the first missionary tour.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s described for us
in the book of Acts chapter 13.

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:18.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 13:4, 5, it says:

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So these men [that is, Barnabas and Saul],

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sent out by the holy spirit,
went down to Seleucia,

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they arrived in Salamis,
they began proclaiming the word of God

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:33.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the synagogues of the Jews.

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also had John as an attendant.”

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he is described here as “an attendant.”

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote says “an assistant.”

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer of Acts used
a very interesting word here for “attendant,”

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:53.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s a Greek word that literally means
“an under-rower.”

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:57.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
An under-rower was a man
who worked below the decks

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:01.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a large Roman naval vessel.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would be below deck,
he would have to row in unison

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in cooperation) with his fellow rowers,

00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:12.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would have to follow the pace
set by the captain.

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would this term be used
for John Mark in this instance?

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a clue comes from verse 4,
where it says:

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:21.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They sailed away to Cyprus.”

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the metaphor of an under-rower

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:27.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
now takes on greater meaning.

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Incidentally, the same term
is used by the apostle Paul

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:33.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he refers to himself
as a servant of God,

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an attendant, in 1 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would that be significant?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why use it in 1 Corinthians?

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in one of the bays next to Corinth,

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:47.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
the large ships of the Roman navy
took port there.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, again, the metaphor

00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:52.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the under-rower
would take on great meaning.

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the infamous event

00:04:56.859 --> 00:05:00.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
occurred in Acts chapter 15

00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:05.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the event John Mark was an object of.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:09.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in Acts chapter 15,

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:12.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning in verse 37, it says:

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Barnabas was determined
to take along John, who was called Mark.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul, however, was not in favor
of taking him along with them,

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:24.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seeing that he had departed
from them in Pamphylia

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and had not gone with them to the work.

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this there was a sharp burst of anger,

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:32.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they separated from each other;

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:36.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Barnabas took Mark along
and sailed away to Cyprus.”

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:41.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Denied an opportunity, denied a privilege,

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does Mark do?

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says he “sailed away
[with Barnabas] to Cyprus.”

00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:53.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark kept active in Jehovah’s service.

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do that?

00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:59.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark was not so concerned

00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:01.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a lost privilege

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he failed to appreciate
the opportunities that were in front of him.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, while he’s sailing away and working,
what’s Paul doing?

00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:16.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 40 says: “Paul selected Silas.”

00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 41 says:
“He went through Syria and Cilicia,

00:06:19.483 --> 00:06:21.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthening the congregations.”

00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:26.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you carry on in chapter 16,
we find him arriving

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:28.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Derbe and Lystra,

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:31.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 1 says

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:33.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
he met Timothy, a disciple.

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 3, what happens?

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:40.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul expressed a desire
for Timothy to join him

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:44.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark’s replacement.

00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:50.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, as Paul now begins
to travel with Timothy,

00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:52.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that the apostle Paul writes

00:06:52.683 --> 00:06:55.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Thessalonians within a year.

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:58.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at 1 Thessalonians 1:1,

00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:03.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s greeting is
from Paul, Silas, and Timothy.

00:07:03.318 --> 00:07:05.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Thessalonians too is

00:07:05.487 --> 00:07:08.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Paul, Silas, and Timothy.

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:13.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how Mark is feeling at this point.

00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:15.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Five years later,
he writes to the Corinthians.

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:18.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, again,
now it’s from Paul and Timothy.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:24.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
During all this time,
where Timothy is rising, what’s Mark doing?

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:27.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s rowing.

00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:30.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark is continually,
faithfully serving Jehovah.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:33.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eleven years later,
in the years 60 C.E. to 61 C.E.,

00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:36.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul was in Rome, who was with him?

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:38.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark.

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Paul
wrote letters to various congregations,

00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:44.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
he describes John Mark.

00:07:44.943 --> 00:07:48.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in one of the letters
in sending greetings (this is in Colossians),

00:07:48.613 --> 00:07:52.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
he makes reference to the fact
that he had wanted to send John Mark

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:56.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a personal representative
to the congregations.

00:07:57.414 --> 00:08:00.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that indicates to us
what kind of man Mark was

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what reputation he had.

00:08:03.378 --> 00:08:07.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
A personal representative
was someone who was deeply trusted,

00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:12.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would have to represent Paul
before the congregations that he would visit.

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:15.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the reputation of John Mark.

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:19.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, there’s no record in the Scriptures
of the challenges

00:08:19.603 --> 00:08:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
that John Mark faced in his ministry.

00:08:21.938 --> 00:08:26.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no shipwrecks, no beatings,
no hunger, no left-for-dead for John Mark.

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:30.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is one challenge that he faced
that is shared with us.

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:33.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is his difficulty, or the challenge,

00:08:33.575 --> 00:08:37.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the apostle Paul—his brother.

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, clearly, there were no hard feelings
between these two men,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though there was a difference.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
in Paul’s final words chronologically

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the book of 2 Timothy chapter 4
in reference to John Mark,

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
he tells Timothy: ‘Bring Mark.

00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:55.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is helpful’

00:08:56.723 --> 00:08:59.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the under-rower, John Mark.

00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly,
for all that we know about Timothy,

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:05.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are no words recorded

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Timothy’s in the Scriptures.

00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:12.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, John Mark wrote a Gospel.

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:14.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a typical under-rower,

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:17.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
he never mentioned his name.

00:09:17.452 --> 00:09:20.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we put the pieces together

00:09:20.497 --> 00:09:22.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what is shared
of John Mark in the Scriptures,

00:09:22.749 --> 00:09:24.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
we get a portrait of a man

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was (1) zealous for promoting
the good news in the worldwide field

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:33.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (2) happy to serve others.

00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:37.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
This alone is worthy of our imitation.

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:39.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is more.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your future, you may be the object

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
caught up in a Paul-and-Barnabas moment.

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:50.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may face changed circumstances

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of health or family issues.

00:09:54.614 --> 00:09:59.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may be the one who has to work
in the shadow of a Timothy.

00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:01.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
A door may close for you

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:04.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be closed for you.

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:09.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Mark, do not be so concerned
about lost privileges

00:10:09.713 --> 00:10:12.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you fail to appreciate the opportunities

00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:15.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are right in front of you.

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:18.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you, like Mark,
keep your heart

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your hands strong.

00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:22.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep them on the oars.

00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:24.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work in unison.

00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:28.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cooperate with your brothers and sisters
for the Master.

00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:33.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you, like Mark, be the under-rower.
