A very favorite part
of our Gilead graduation program

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
is <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we get to know a few of our students
a little bit more intimately.

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re looking forward to hearing that now

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it’s presented by Brother Mark Noumair.

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eighty years!

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those reaching this milestone in life are
described as having “special mightiness.”

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does that apply just to people?

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 153rd class

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
marks the 80th anniversary
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
During that span, the school
has survived a world war,

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
country bans, legal threats, mob threats,

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even a global pandemic.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’ve done more than just survive.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to this edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Kings 13:18, 19,

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Elisha told King Jehoash

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘take the arrows and strike the ground.’

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was to indicate his zeal and enthusiasm
for Jehovah’s work.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, the king’s zeal was lacking.

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:43.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about those taking the lead
in Jehovah’s organization today?

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:47.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have they been striking the ground
with hearts full of zeal and persistence?

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they have, and Gilead School

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives irrefutable evidence of this.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
As World War II raged,

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s spirit led our brothers
to see the need

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
for increased divine education
before the end of this system.

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
The organization’s president, Nathan Knorr,

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:10.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
directed the start of Gilead School
in South Lansing, New York.

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in 1943,

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:15.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithful men such as Albert Schroeder,

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:18.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russell Kurzen, Maxwell Friend,

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frederick Franz, and Eduardo Keller

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
instructed the first classes of students

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
eager to go where people
needed to hear the good news.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:31.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then, Gilead’s location has changed

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instructors have changed,
but one thing hasn’t changed:

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead graduates have used
their theocratic education

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen their brothers and sisters
wherever they’ve been assigned.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this world continues its downward spiral,

00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead continues to thrive and adapt

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:55.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it meets the needs
of Jehovah’s growing organization.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so with that,

00:02:57.197 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s welcome our students and learn how

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:03.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gilead legacy has impacted them.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please welcome our first guests,

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Kunda from Zambia.

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so happy to have you with us on
<i>The Inside Story,</i> Kena and Chila.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long have you been serving in Zambia?

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
And tell us about your assignments
at the branch office.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:36.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been serving at the branch
for five years now, and we’re both assigned

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Local Design/Construction Department,
LDC.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful, and here we see
a picture of these smiling faces.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you both are.

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:46.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who are the three others in the picture?

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those three are three field representatives,

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this was during a Kingdom Hall build
that we visited.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:54.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really enjoyed that assignment.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously, you did.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at those smiling faces.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s building Kingdom Halls.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:01.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kena, you’re working with LDC.

00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many Kingdom halls are needed in Zambia?

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:08.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the next five years,
we need a thousand new Kingdom Halls.

00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:09.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
A thousand Kingdom Halls.

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that fast growth of Kingdom publishers,

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s something that’s marvelous to see.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, what is the ratio there in Zambia?

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:23.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently, there are
a little over 190,000 publishers in Zambia,

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that would make it approximately
1 Witness to 99 people.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
One to 99—that is just wonderful!

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you contribute to that?

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can think of two factors:

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:36.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, anyone who visits Zambia

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
remembers it for its warmhearted people.

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are very humble and welcome
good conversations about the Bible.

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:44.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:47.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then, that is something
that is very attractive

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the truth is attractive to them—
humble, warmhearted people.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, many people mention that to me
that have visited Zambia as well.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
So good.

00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:57.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else?

00:04:57.234 --> 00:05:01.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second factor is that the government
is favorable toward Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing the preaching work to flourish.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:05.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:11.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been highly regarded
as a stabilizing influence on society,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this in turn moves
many honesthearted ones to learn the truth.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:18.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the training Jehovah gives his people,
wouldn’t you say?

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:22.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
The training, the divine education
that God’s people have been given

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now that translates into how they teach

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they interact with people.

00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:29.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you say that?

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:31.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:33.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, thanks to that divine education,

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:38.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people apply
that knowledge in their lives, others see it,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all praise and glory goes to Jehovah.

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:41.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful!

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:42.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
So warmhearted people,

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:45.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
a stabilizing influence
in the community, growth

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:49.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Kingdom work and Kingdom growth
is happening in Zambia.

00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:53.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something else
that’s dear to all our hearts

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:55.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has had an impact on the Kingdom growth.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what would that be, Chila?

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:01.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  series
with Caleb and Sophia.

00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:05.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
These videos have taught valuable principles
to young ones very effectively.

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:09.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like that
—valuable principles for young ones.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as these young ones
are learning these Bible principles

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:16.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and that’s instilled
in their little hearts and minds),

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they grow up, what’s the result?

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:21.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it’s just wonderful to see how

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:24.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization is using
the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend </i> series

00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the young ones,
because it’s laying a foundation for them

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:30.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become mature Christians
when they grow up.

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:34.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they have a pattern of making decisions
that reflect Jehovah’s thinking.

00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:38.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
They grow up and become pioneers and elders
in the congregation.

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent, and were you speaking
about one in particular?

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we have a good example of that
with Jamin.

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:48.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is one of many young ones in Zambia

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
who enjoys using
the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  series.

00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:53.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, and here we see a picture.

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:54.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you explain that picture?

00:06:54.226 --> 00:06:57.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jamin is closest to his dad on the left.

00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:00.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both his parents are regular pioneers,

00:07:00.357 --> 00:07:04.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they got his name from the video
<i>Warning Examples for Our Day.</i>

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:05.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s Jamin again.

00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:08.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he’s about six years old now.

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can see
he looks very ready for the ministry.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:11.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does.

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:13.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he enjoys using the videos

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he’s able to even recite them
from the heart.

00:07:16.498 --> 00:07:20.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he goes as far as even imitating Sophia

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:23.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and taking some publications
with him to school.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he does so good to the extent

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:27.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even when he’s packing the publications,

00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:30.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has a friend in mind
whom he wants to give it to.

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s that evangelizing spirit
at a young age that’s taking root in Zambia

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>
series—excellent.

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:41.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Missionary spirit, here we go—wonderful.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when you think
about the legacy of Gilead School

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:46.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the missionary spirit there in Zambia

00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:49.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
(this is the 80th anniversary of the school),

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
the impact
in Zambia became very obvious early on.

00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:57.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the first Gilead missionaries

00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:00.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arrive in Zambia were (in 1948) 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Harry Arnott and John Ferguson.

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see their pictures here.

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:08.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were in the eighth class of Gilead

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:11.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with Stanley Jones and Harold King.

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:15.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
In those early days,
those early classes of Gilead,

00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:18.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
11 percent were of the anointed,

00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:21.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that led
to a stabilizing influence as well

00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:24.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the global field with Gilead graduates.

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:26.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we went to the Gilead archives,

00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we found some
of Brother Ferguson’s handwritten letters.

00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:33.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s one (in that letter)

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:36.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he mentions that in 1948
when he arrived,

00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:41.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were only 15,000 publishers in Zambia.

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back then,
the country was called Northern Rhodesia.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:47.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was his prayer that <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:08:47.172 --> 00:08:51.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be translated
into the local language of Cibemba,

00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:53.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he prayed for more missionaries to come.

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful spirit!

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that prayer answered?

00:08:56.848 --> 00:08:59.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly answered those prayers.

00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:02.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we have all the study publications

00:09:02.104 --> 00:09:04.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
translated not just into Cibemba

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:06.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
but into 12 other local languages.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:07.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, to date, some 58 Gilead graduates
have been assigned to Zambia.

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
So more publications, more translation,

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:18.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
more Gilead graduates sent in.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a legacy now that the Gilead School

00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:23.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
has had in Zambia!

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:27.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that those missionaries helped us
in more ways than just the preaching work.

00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:29.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why do you say that?

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:32.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around 1968, there was a ban on the work

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:36.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resulted in the deportation
of the initial group of missionaries,

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:40.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this was followed by a wave
of persecution and opposition.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
That made it a challenge to organize
the work for the local brothers.

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:47.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, at one point,
it seemed like the work was stagnating.

00:09:47.357 --> 00:09:50.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1986, something exciting happened.

00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:51.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:54.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Missionaries were allowed back into Zambia.

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:55.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember that too.

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were missionaries in East Africa,

00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:00.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the lifting of the ban in Zambia
was big news.

00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:03.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it excited us
over in East Africa as well.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayed for the brothers in Zambia,

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:09.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we’re so happy that things
were able to move forward.

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:13.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
That showed that the work
continued to pick up after that in 1986.

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened after 1986?

00:10:16.052 --> 00:10:18.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, there was a great increase
in new publishers.

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:21.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the missionaries helped the new ones
to progress to maturity,

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
stabilizing them.

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:26.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
In speaking to the local brothers
that served during that time,

00:10:26.813 --> 00:10:29.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
they especially appreciated
how the missionaries

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:32.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped them organize the work
from the branch office.

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:34.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from there

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:38.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
they helped the field thrive
and experience incredible growth.

00:10:38.241 --> 00:10:41.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re saying the local brothers
and the missionaries worked together

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:44.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that it would have brought
positive results?

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:45.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:46.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:50.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the local brothers respond when
the missionaries came in to work with them?

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:53.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say that was the best part.

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:56.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local publishers
came to love the missionaries.

00:10:56.134 --> 00:10:58.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so kind and humble
right from the start.

00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:02.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
It opened their eyes to the fact
that we’re all one and the same.

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:05.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to see the missionaries

00:11:05.435 --> 00:11:09.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
try and say a greeting in the local language,
it was nice to see.

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:12.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to see them progress
from just a greeting

00:11:12.692 --> 00:11:14.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to holding a long conversation

00:11:14.903 --> 00:11:19.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to even giving a public talk
in my local language—that was heartwarming.

00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:21.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
That must have been wonderful
to hear and to see.

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:22.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the missionaries also

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:27.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t rush their time
with the local publishers,

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:30.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this helped them to learn more
about the culture.

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:34.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, accepting a meal invitation
after an assembly—

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:35.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would be tired,
and they’d be hungry too.

00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:42.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this was not a quick meal
at a restaurant.

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:44.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant going home and cooking,

00:11:44.307 --> 00:11:45.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting the food prepared, . . .

00:11:45.517 --> 00:11:46.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:47.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . getting the chicken ready.

00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:49.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:11:49.688 --> 00:11:53.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it meant you ate late,
and they had to go home late.

00:11:53.483 --> 00:11:56.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the highlight of this

00:11:56.152 --> 00:11:58.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the encouragement that they gave us.

00:11:58.196 --> 00:11:58.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
They encouraged us to pursue spiritual goals.

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:04.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could see the love that they had for us,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
but most important, we could feel it.

00:12:06.413 --> 00:12:07.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:08.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you agree, Kena?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:11.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
I experienced that at a young age.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:16.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one time, my family
had a missionary couple over for lunch,

00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:18.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Finch.

00:12:18.675 --> 00:12:21.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a good meal, a wonderful time.

00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:25.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what we remembered from that day
was something totally different.

00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:30.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few days after they left,
the Finches sent us a small thank you card.

00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
They expressed appreciation for the time

00:12:32.188 --> 00:12:34.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and shared a Scriptural thought too.

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:38.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
That they took the time to do this
touched all of us deeply.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, my father used that card
as an object lesson in teaching us children

00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:44.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to show gratitude
when others do kind things for us.

00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:46.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:49.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s these little acts of love,
these little stitches of love,

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:51.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make this close-knit bond

00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a loving brotherhood there in Zambia.

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:56.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, there’s Brother and Sister Finch
there with you.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:01.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see from the smile
that they have become fully Zambian now.

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy to serve with them at the branch 

00:13:04.387 --> 00:13:07.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue learning
many valuable lessons from them.

00:13:07.098 --> 00:13:07.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good, excellent.

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:11.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what if we now show the audience
a short video clip

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:13.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Zambia and what’s happening there
and the work?

00:13:13.855 --> 00:13:14.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to do that?

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:15.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:15.315 --> 00:13:16.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:17.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, let’s watch.

00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:20.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Located in southern Africa,

00:13:20.862 --> 00:13:23.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zambia is about a quarter
of a million square miles (647,000 sq km)

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:27.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a little larger than the state of Texas
in the United States.

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:31.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zambia is home to beautiful forests,

00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:33.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mighty Zambezi River,

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:36.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
magnificent waterfalls,
and abundant wildlife.

00:13:38.296 --> 00:13:40.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and because of our mild climate,

00:13:40.548 --> 00:13:42.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy a rich variety of foods.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the real beauty of Zambia
lies in its people.

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:51.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can find Jehovah’s people
almost everywhere you go.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the ministry
continues to be ripe for harvesting.

00:13:56.106 --> 00:13:59.943 line:10% position:50% align:center
If you called on a person in the morning

00:13:59.943 --> 00:14:01.903 line:10% position:50% align:center
and a Witness comes in the afternoon,

00:14:01.903 --> 00:14:04.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
in other countries
they’ll let you know that that’s happened.

00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:07.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in Zambia,
they’ll just listen a second time.

00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:10.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
When going from house to house,

00:14:10.578 --> 00:14:13.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes a person will invite you,

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:17.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
not into their house,
but to sit under the mango tree.

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:21.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
They bring their tins,
their buckets, or whatever,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you sit there,
and then you can speak with them.

00:14:24.843 --> 00:14:28.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes they
even will collect their Bible from inside

00:14:28.847 --> 00:14:32.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they see you because they know
you’re there to discuss the Bible.

00:14:32.308 --> 00:14:34.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’re very lovable people.

00:14:35.478 --> 00:14:37.814 line:10% position:50% align:center
The simple, friendly approach

00:14:37.814 --> 00:14:40.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the brothers and sisters have to the ministry

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:42.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their strong belief

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everyone
is a potential friend of Jehovah

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:49.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that helps them to make
spiritual progress with people.

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:52.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can everyone in Zambia
be a Jehovah’s Witness?

00:14:52.954 --> 00:14:55.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I think it’s a good goal to have.

00:14:56.124 --> 00:15:00.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zealous proclaimers
come in all shapes and sizes.

00:15:00.044 --> 00:15:02.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to see Jamin in action?

00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:11.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to be like Jamin when I grow up.

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:12.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:14.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:15.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jamin is one of many young ones

00:15:15.977 --> 00:15:19.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Zambia right now
who are making Jehovah’s heart so happy.

00:15:20.648 --> 00:15:24.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you travel to Zambia,
what will you find?

00:15:25.528 --> 00:15:27.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will see a great crowd of loyal

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hardworking Kingdom proclaimers.

00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:33.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while we are all different colors
and ages and sizes,

00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:36.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are one big happy family

00:15:36.623 --> 00:15:39.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
thanks to our happy God, Jehovah.

00:15:46.174 --> 00:15:48.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was just a beautiful video clip.

00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:49.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:51.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Kena,

00:15:51.095 --> 00:15:54.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother and sister at the end with
Brother and Sister Finch, they look like you.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Mom and Dad, and that’s them

00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:01.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
meeting the Finches after almost 25 years.

00:16:02.232 --> 00:16:04.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful reunion that must have been!

00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:05.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
And are they with us today?

00:16:06.653 --> 00:16:09.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, in fact, they are
somewhere in the audience.

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:12.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.
I bet they’re very proud of you both.

00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:17.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thank you for sharing your comments
with us with <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:16:17.664 --> 00:16:20.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just watching this video helps us to see why

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:24.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
the love and the joy of the Zambian people

00:16:24.003 --> 00:16:25.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
come through very, very loud and clear.

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with that, we say thank you.

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:31.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, please welcome

00:16:31.302 --> 00:16:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eric and Megan Lee from Micronesia.

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:51.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so happy to have you,
Eric and Megan, on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:16:51.906 --> 00:16:54.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
So tell us, before coming to Gilead,

00:16:54.826 --> 00:16:58.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
you were serving in the Micronesia branch,

00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is located
on the beautiful island of Guam.

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:06.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how long have you been serving there,
and what’s your work like at Bethel?

00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’ve been serving there
for the last ten years.

00:17:09.632 --> 00:17:11.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last eight of those years, Megan and I

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:14.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been serving
at the branch office together.

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:16.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I currently work
in the Service Department.

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.
And what about you, Megan?

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:19.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your work assignment?

00:17:19.893 --> 00:17:22.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work in the Translation Department,

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:27.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we support the work of six remote
translation offices throughout Micronesia.

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.
I bet that’s a lot of work.

00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:30.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for doing it.

00:17:30.737 --> 00:17:33.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on our screen,
we have a very interesting picture.

00:17:33.364 --> 00:17:36.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eric, what is happening here?
Tell us about it.

00:17:36.576 --> 00:17:40.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the two of us
when we visited the island of Pohnpei.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were sent there
to help teach a Bethel Service School.

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is when we first arrived
on the island at the airport.

00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:50.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were greeted by the brothers and sisters,

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they gave us what you see
on the top of our heads.

00:17:52.717 --> 00:17:53.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:56.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Locally, those are called <i>mwarmwars</i>.

00:17:56.471 --> 00:18:00.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re handwoven
by the brothers and sisters,

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:02.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re often given to guests
when they first arrive.

00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:05.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, that’s a lot of work to make those,

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:07.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it shows the hospitality and love.

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:09.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice, thank you.

00:18:10.068 --> 00:18:12.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, Megan,

00:18:12.695 --> 00:18:15.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand you were born on Guam.

00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what was it like growing up
on the island of Guam?

00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell us about it.

00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it is a small island,
so no matter where you are,

00:18:23.831 --> 00:18:26.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch office is never far away.

00:18:26.334 --> 00:18:31.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was definitely a special privilege
to be able to grow up so close to Bethel.

00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:33.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
How far would the branch have been
from where you were raised?

00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:35.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe a little less than 15 minutes.

00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
So was Bethel in your backyard?

00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:38.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very close.

00:18:38.304 --> 00:18:40.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.
So how did that impact you?

00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:43.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very special to be so close

00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:45.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a center of spiritual activity

00:18:45.603 --> 00:18:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
where so many brothers and sisters
are working hard full-time for Jehovah.

00:18:48.898 --> 00:18:50.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:53.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually,
my sister started commuting to Bethel,

00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:56.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she invited me to join her,
so we were able to do that together.

00:18:56.614 --> 00:19:00.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent, so you commuted to Bethel
with your sister.

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:01.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who’s older, you or her?

00:19:01.577 --> 00:19:02.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is.

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:04.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is.
OK, very nice.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a privilege to be together
commuting there

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:09.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Bethel in Guam!

00:19:09.168 --> 00:19:10.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about you, Eric?

00:19:10.628 --> 00:19:12.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell us about yourself.

00:19:12.046 --> 00:19:13.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about your family?

00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:15.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, my mom was born on Guam.

00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:18.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her side of the family is from there,

00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:21.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she grew up in Washington State.

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:23.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where she met my father.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:27.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
But something interesting happened
to my mom before she was married.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:33.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after she graduated high school
she took a trip to Guam,

00:19:33.192 --> 00:19:36.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she was impressed
by the need that was there,

00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
so much so that she had this strong desire

00:19:40.116 --> 00:19:43.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go back to Guam someday
in order to preach there.

00:19:43.244 --> 00:19:45.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
We call that the missionary spirit.

00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:46.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she wanted to go back.

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:48.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
So tell us what happened.

00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:52.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, my parents were married,
and they served at Brooklyn Bethel.

00:19:52.712 --> 00:19:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1979, they attended Gilead School.

00:19:56.132 --> 00:19:57.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, interesting.

00:19:58.009 --> 00:20:02.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had graduated from the 67th class of
Gilead, and then my mom’s dream came true.

00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:04.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got their assignment?

00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:06.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their assignment was Guam.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, beautiful. 
Excellent.

00:20:07.977 --> 00:20:10.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they absolutely loved that assignment.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then some years later,
my siblings and I came along.

00:20:14.067 --> 00:20:16.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.
So then what happened?

00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:21.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after some years,
we moved back to Washington State.

00:20:21.282 --> 00:20:23.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even though we left Guam,

00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
something never changed for my parents.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their love for the people of Guam
never changed.

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:32.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
So although they were geographically located

00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:37.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
outside of Guam in the United States,
here in Washington, their heart

00:20:37.131 --> 00:20:38.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
was still in Guam.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did that influence you as a young man?

00:20:41.928 --> 00:20:43.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sure did.

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:45.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
They still had that missionary spirit,

00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they wanted to encourage us
to reach out and do more.

00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:53.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one time, as an entire family,
we visited Guam.

00:20:53.523 --> 00:20:56.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
During that trip, I fell in love with Guam.

00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did?

00:20:57.026 --> 00:20:58.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved it so much

00:20:58.236 --> 00:21:02.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when I turned 19,
I decided to move to Guam by myself.

00:21:02.824 --> 00:21:04.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at a convenient time,

00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:08.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rest of my family ended up
moving out to Guam as well.

00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:11.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in fact, both my parents
are still serving there now.

00:21:11.707 --> 00:21:12.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
So your mother and father

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their love for the people in Guam

00:21:18.631 --> 00:21:23.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
evidently influenced you, because you fell
in love with the people in Guam too . . .

00:21:23.052 --> 00:21:24.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sure did.

00:21:24.053 --> 00:21:26.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . especially with someone very special.

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:28.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:30.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we see here, Eric?

00:21:30.476 --> 00:21:32.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a picture of my family

00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:37.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
just outside the Kingdom Hall
that we attended when we were young.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s my parents, my older sister,

00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:44.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
my two younger brothers, and that is me
standing in the back.

00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have another picture too.

00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:50.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is again, all of us,
but when we’re a little more grown up.

00:21:50.663 --> 00:21:54.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were together on Guam at a convention.

00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:57.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now your parents
are still in Guam serving there.

00:21:57.879 --> 00:22:00.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what a good example
they must have set, though,

00:22:00.631 --> 00:22:02.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you and the family and the siblings,

00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:04.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how encouraged they must have been

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:07.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you too had that missionary spirit!

00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:08.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:22:08.723 --> 00:22:12.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell us how many publishers there are
in Micronesia at this time.

00:22:12.935 --> 00:22:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have about 1,200 publishers.

00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:18.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s throughout all
the islands in Micronesia.

00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:21.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know that number
may not sound like much,

00:22:21.235 --> 00:22:23.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
but actually it is
a really impressive number.

00:22:23.863 --> 00:22:25.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what makes it impressive?

00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:30.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I think it’s the fact that new ones
face a definite challenge

00:22:30.828 --> 00:22:32.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
before they come in the truth.

00:22:32.872 --> 00:22:36.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
The communities in Micronesia
are very small.

00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:37.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re very close-knit,

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:41.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people really depend on one another
for everyday life.

00:22:41.714 --> 00:22:44.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when someone becomes a Witness,

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:48.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
they can be viewed by their community
as an outsider

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:51.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they lose that connection
to that support system

00:22:51.515 --> 00:22:53.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they’ve had for so long.

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:56.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s a real test of faith for them
to trust that Jehovah

00:22:56.854 --> 00:22:59.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
can and will take care of them.

00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:00.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it must not be easy.

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:04.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sure isn’t easy for many of them.

00:23:04.153 --> 00:23:08.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
But despite those challenges,
many honesthearted ones

00:23:08.032 --> 00:23:11.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
courageously take a stand
to join Jehovah’s people.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:12.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:23:12.954 --> 00:23:15.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when they do that, 
they receive a wonderful blessing.

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
They end up becoming
like a family to one another.

00:23:19.418 --> 00:23:23.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when there is that time of need,
they are right there to help them.

00:23:23.256 --> 00:23:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:23:24.507 --> 00:23:26.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s something that’s very touching to see.

00:23:26.384 --> 00:23:30.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the love of Micronesia
is obvious and evident.

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:33.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can you relate another example

00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:36.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Christian love there in Micronesia?

00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:41.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
One that very quickly comes to mind
for both of us is the island of Kosrae.

00:23:41.232 --> 00:23:42.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kosrae.

00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:44.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we don’t hear often about Kosrae.

00:23:44.986 --> 00:23:46.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about it?

00:23:46.445 --> 00:23:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a very small island
that has just one congregation

00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:52.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
of about eight publishers,

00:23:52.326 --> 00:23:54.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet they’re so faithful and loyal to Jehovah.

00:23:54.912 --> 00:23:56.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interesting.
Eight publishers.

00:23:56.789 --> 00:24:00.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is interested
in this small group, 

00:24:00.293 --> 00:24:03.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like in Noah’s day,
they were just eight.

00:24:03.004 --> 00:24:05.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kosrae has about eight.

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how is Jehovah’s interest shown in them?

00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:12.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s very clear
from the translation work that’s being done.

00:24:12.388 --> 00:24:15.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization provides publications

00:24:15.391 --> 00:24:18.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are translated
into their local language.

00:24:18.185 --> 00:24:20.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just so incredible to see. 

00:24:20.479 --> 00:24:23.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because what other organization
would do that besides Jehovah’s?

00:24:23.858 --> 00:24:25.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:24:25.443 --> 00:24:29.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is proof that he’s reassuring them
that he sees them and that he loves them.

00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, they must be thrilled with that.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing
that very important point.

00:24:34.994 --> 00:24:37.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we have?

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:39.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a paradisaic assignment,

00:24:39.707 --> 00:24:41.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it does come with some challenges.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you say, the courage
to stand up for one’s beliefs

00:24:47.256 --> 00:24:52.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the island just having a few publishers
—these are challenges.

00:24:52.053 --> 00:24:53.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Am I missing anything?

00:24:54.388 --> 00:24:59.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, something else that comes to mind
is that some of these islands are so remote,

00:24:59.268 --> 00:25:02.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of that,
they don’t always have very good Internet.

00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:04.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that means it can be a challenge to get

00:25:04.648 --> 00:25:07.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spiritual food
to our brothers and sisters at times.

00:25:07.193 --> 00:25:10.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would they meet that challenge?

00:25:10.154 --> 00:25:12.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a huge help has been the JW Box.

00:25:12.907 --> 00:25:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see a picture of it here.

00:25:15.284 --> 00:25:17.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
The JW Box is a small device.

00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can actually fit in your hand.

00:25:20.456 --> 00:25:23.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the JW Box can connect to the Internet

00:25:23.292 --> 00:25:27.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and download almost anything
that’s available on jw.org.

00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:28.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:32.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, once it downloads
publications and videos,

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:37.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters can connect
their personal devices to the JW Box.

00:25:37.181 --> 00:25:40.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they have access
to all of this spiritual food

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:43.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
without them ever needing to connect
to the Internet themselves.

00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:45.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that is a wonderful provision,

00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:47.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we thank
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
for making sure the brothers in Kosrae
are spiritually nourished.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:25:52.947 --> 00:25:55.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Gilead legacy continues

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:57.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
on there in Micronesia.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was started back there in 1954

00:26:00.454 --> 00:26:03.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the first Gilead-trained missionaries
came to Micronesia.

00:26:03.707 --> 00:26:05.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we see a picture of them.

00:26:05.126 --> 00:26:08.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is Sam Wiger and his wife, Virginia.

00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:12.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at that time, there were only
about 12 publishers in Guam.

00:26:12.883 --> 00:26:16.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
But ‘never despise
the day of small beginnings,’

00:26:16.262 --> 00:26:20.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
because with their arrival,
the Gilead legacy was set in motion.

00:26:20.724 --> 00:26:24.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now the Micronesia branch territory

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:27.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
spreads over a large area with many islands.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and some of these islands
you can’t reach by plane.

00:26:31.068 --> 00:26:34.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can only take a boat to get there.

00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:37.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the branch office
has organized preaching campaigns

00:26:37.116 --> 00:26:41.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
where boats of Witnesses go to these
different islands and preach there.

00:26:41.412 --> 00:26:44.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s actually what we see
in this picture here.

00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:48.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by boat, the brothers reach this island.

00:26:48.043 --> 00:26:49.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what are we seeing?

00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:51.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this a congregation meeting?

00:26:51.922 --> 00:26:55.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a few days of preaching on the island,

00:26:55.134 --> 00:26:59.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was their last day,
and they invited all the interested ones

00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:01.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come together to this group meeting.

00:27:01.724 --> 00:27:04.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what they did
was they had a group Bible study.

00:27:04.643 --> 00:27:08.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they focused on teaching
these interested ones

00:27:08.522 --> 00:27:11.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to study the
<i>Bible Teach </i> book on their own.

00:27:11.233 --> 00:27:11.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:27:11.942 --> 00:27:14.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way, when the brothers and sisters left,

00:27:14.069 --> 00:27:16.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could still feed themselves spiritually.

00:27:16.697 --> 00:27:18.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that is so encouraging.

00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:20.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:27:20.618 --> 00:27:22.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s a beautiful island, true.

00:27:22.453 --> 00:27:24.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s the precious people

00:27:24.288 --> 00:27:29.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the island that are really benefiting
from Jehovah’s provisions.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should we do?

00:27:30.628 --> 00:27:32.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we take a trip

00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:34.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Micronesian islands
and visit the brothers

00:27:34.673 --> 00:27:36.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how they’re doing?

00:27:36.008 --> 00:27:37.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to do that?

00:27:37.092 --> 00:27:37.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d love that.

00:27:37.927 --> 00:27:40.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.
Then let’s pay attention to the video.

00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:44.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Located in the western Pacific Ocean,

00:27:44.683 --> 00:27:48.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micronesia is one
of three major island regions,

00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:50.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with Polynesia and Melanesia.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word Micronesia means “small islands”

00:27:54.527 --> 00:27:57.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and includes some 2,000 scattered islands.

00:27:57.321 --> 00:28:01.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, the islands are so tiny
that their combined landmass

00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:04.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
is only about 1,055 square miles,

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 2,730 square kilometers,
not much larger than

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:13.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of Rhode Island,
the smallest state in the United States.

00:28:13.045 --> 00:28:16.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch is located on the island of Guam

00:28:16.048 --> 00:28:19.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is referred to as the Micronesia branch.

00:28:19.301 --> 00:28:20.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most people think

00:28:20.594 --> 00:28:24.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Paradise when they come to Micronesia,
but it’s the spiritual paradise

00:28:24.723 --> 00:28:27.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is truly breathtaking.

00:28:27.643 --> 00:28:29.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:31.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters are hardworking 

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loyal for Jehovah’s name.

00:28:34.984 --> 00:28:39.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, on the island of Kosrae,

00:28:39.697 --> 00:28:42.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may be a small group,
but they are sending up

00:28:42.866 --> 00:28:46.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
a great shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:28:46.704 --> 00:28:49.248 line:10% position:50% align:center
What I love about our assignment in Kosrae

00:28:49.248 --> 00:28:50.874 line:10% position:50% align:center
is that the people

00:28:50.874 --> 00:28:53.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
really have a love for the Bible.

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:54.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very easy

00:28:54.795 --> 00:28:57.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have Bible studies

00:28:57.673 --> 00:28:59.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
or long conversations with people.

00:28:59.883 --> 00:29:02.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it makes it very easy to talk

00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:03.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
to them about spiritual things.

00:29:03.929 --> 00:29:06.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes the ministry very enjoyable.

00:29:06.974 --> 00:29:10.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
In case you saw a family resemblance,

00:29:10.436 --> 00:29:12.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wasn’t just our sister in the truth.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was Megan’s real sister.

00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:19.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of them and all those exerting 

00:29:19.862 --> 00:29:23.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
themselves vigorously to reach
honesthearted people in remote areas.

00:29:23.741 --> 00:29:26.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t forget time zones.

00:29:26.076 --> 00:29:27.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:29.496 line:10% position:50% align:center
The circuit we’re currently in

00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:32.541 line:10% position:50% align:center
is made up of four different time zones,

00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:35.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
eight different islands, 
and from east to west,

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:39.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a distance
of about 2,500 miles (4,000 km).

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in our circuit, there are
actually seven different languages.

00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:44.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a lot of work.

00:29:44.428 --> 00:29:48.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each week we pack our bags
and then move on to the next island.

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:51.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
The friends are never alone,
no matter how far out they might be

00:29:51.894 --> 00:29:54.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
or how few publishers might be there.

00:29:54.229 --> 00:29:56.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see generosity.

00:29:56.815 --> 00:29:58.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see contentment.

00:29:58.525 --> 00:30:00.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see zeal.

00:30:00.402 --> 00:30:02.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is taking care of them.

00:30:03.447 --> 00:30:07.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
On these islands, the precious resources

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:09.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
are definitely Jehovah’s people.

00:30:09.036 --> 00:30:10.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:11.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micronesia may be remote,

00:30:11.997 --> 00:30:15.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
but once you’re here, you’re home.

00:30:17.878 --> 00:30:19.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eric, that was beautiful.

00:30:19.338 --> 00:30:21.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Once you’re here, you’re home.”

00:30:21.507 --> 00:30:23.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for making it your home too.

00:30:23.217 --> 00:30:25.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to meet your sister like that—

00:30:25.094 --> 00:30:27.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re proud of her.
You said you were.

00:30:27.346 --> 00:30:30.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re proud of her too and proud of you.

00:30:30.182 --> 00:30:33.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that circuit overseer couple—they’re
doing a great work, aren’t they, there?

00:30:33.394 --> 00:30:34.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sure are.

00:30:34.395 --> 00:30:36.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
That self-sacrificing spirit—we could say

00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:40.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Gilead, or the missionary,
legacy continues there in Micronesia.

00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:42.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:46.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s very clear
that Jehovah is blessing

00:30:46.156 --> 00:30:49.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers in Micronesia
—the work is thriving.

00:30:49.576 --> 00:30:50.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Megan and Eric,

00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:54.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s just a pleasure to have you with us
not just in class

00:30:54.498 --> 00:30:56.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as part of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:30:56.583 --> 00:30:58.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we wish you the best

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the days ahead.

00:30:59.628 --> 00:31:00.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:31:02.047 --> 00:31:04.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you think?

00:31:04.007 --> 00:31:06.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can a school have “special mightiness”?

00:31:06.552 --> 00:31:10.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can if Jehovah backs it.

00:31:10.055 --> 00:31:13.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what he has done
for Gilead School.

00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:16.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Repeatedly, it has been made clear

00:31:16.395 --> 00:31:19.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is blessing
the Governing Body’s efforts

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote and to support divine education
throughout the earth.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why all this education?

00:31:27.489 --> 00:31:29.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the words of Brother Knorr:

00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:33.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We want to move
to higher levels of understanding

00:31:33.537 --> 00:31:36.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we get deeper
into the thoughts of Jehovah

00:31:36.957 --> 00:31:39.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he . . . expressed them in his Word.”

00:31:39.877 --> 00:31:43.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, nothing can stop divine education,

00:31:43.672 --> 00:31:46.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing will ever slow it down.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world says 80 years
is probably the time to slow down.

00:31:50.554 --> 00:31:54.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to Jehovah’s people,
80 is just getting started.

00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:58.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until the next time on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:32:26.548 --> 00:32:30.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Noumair,
and those who participated with you.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was just outstanding!

00:32:31.887 --> 00:32:36.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine 80 years
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?

00:32:36.475 --> 00:32:40.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, we just remembered
the other day that the brothers,

00:32:40.062 --> 00:32:44.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they initiated Gilead, thought they
would only have enough resources

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to have the school for five years.

00:32:47.736 --> 00:32:50.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing to think what
Jehovah has accomplished!
