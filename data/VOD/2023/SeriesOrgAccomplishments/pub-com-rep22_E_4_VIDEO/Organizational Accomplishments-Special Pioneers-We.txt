00:00:14 When the apostle Paul was busy preaching
00:00:16 in the bustling city of Corinth,
00:00:19 the account at Acts 18:5 says
00:00:22 that “Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word,”
00:00:27 or as the study note in the New World Translation  puts it,
00:00:30 “fully absorbed in preaching the word.”
00:00:35 Those words well describe
00:00:37 the thousands of brothers and sisters
00:00:40 serving today as special pioneers.
00:00:44 Just like Paul, they are “fully absorbed” in their ministry.
00:00:50 They spend about 100 hours in service every month.
00:00:54 With limited time for secular work,
00:00:57 they receive a modest allowance to help with their expenses.
00:01:02 Most of us are familiar with regular and auxiliary pioneers.
00:01:06 Perhaps you serve as one.
00:01:09 But what makes this special pioneer arrangement unique?
00:01:14 In this report,
00:01:15 let’s look at the important role special pioneers have played
00:01:19 and continue to play
00:01:21 in supporting and expanding the disciple-making work
00:01:25 and consider what we can do
00:01:28 to support these dear faithful ones.
00:01:32 The special pioneer arrangement
00:01:34 began more than 85 years ago.
00:01:39 At the 1937 convention in Columbus, Ohio,
00:01:44 Brother Rutherford explained that a group
00:01:47 of about 200 pioneers
00:01:49 were being chosen to serve
00:01:52 as special pioneers.
00:01:55 Their assignment was to take the lead in using
00:01:59 one of the most powerful preaching tools
00:02:02 of the era—the portable phonograph.
00:02:06 Part of the prophecy shows that the people of this day
00:02:09 who are of goodwill toward God and who want to do right
00:02:12 will give heed to his warning given by his Witnesses.
00:02:16 By this time, brothers had been using phonographs
00:02:19 to play short Bible messages for a few years
00:02:23 but usually only after being invited inside someone’s home.
00:02:29 The newly appointed special pioneers
00:02:31 were to spearhead
00:02:33 a new use of the phonograph,
00:02:36 presenting the recorded messages
00:02:38 right on the householder’s doorstep
00:02:41 after just a few words of introduction.
00:02:46 Before long, tens of thousands of phonographs
00:02:49 were in use in the field.
00:02:52 Special pioneers also took the lead
00:02:54 in following up with interested persons and conducting Bible studies,
00:02:59 and they focused mainly
00:03:00 on preaching in big cities.
00:03:03 But within a few years,
00:03:04 the scope was expanded.
00:03:06 Their assignment would now include
00:03:07 remote territories.
00:03:10 As a result of the tireless work
00:03:13 of those intrepid special pioneers,
00:03:15 hundreds of new congregations were formed.
00:03:19 Today, that initial group
00:03:21 of 200 special pioneers
00:03:22 has grown to more than 27,000
00:03:26 and they continue to play a key role in opening up
00:03:28 new territories all over the world.
00:03:34 Some who served faithfully for many years at Bethel
00:03:37 or in other forms of special full-time service, such as the circuit work,
00:03:41 are assigned as special pioneers.
00:03:44 Their experience and zeal are a real benefit to their congregations.
00:03:49 Well, after serving at Bethel for over 30 years,
00:03:53 Laurie and I received the call
00:03:54 from the branch office
00:03:55 that we were being reassigned
00:03:57 as special pioneers to the field.
00:03:59 And when we met with them,
00:04:01 it was a little emotional.
00:04:03 We knew there was a good possibility.
00:04:05 However, it was Jehovah’s direction.
00:04:08 We took a picture with them afterward.
00:04:11 We have that as a really nice memory aid
00:04:14 of the new chapter of our life.
00:04:16 When they moved in, it seemed like they adopted
00:04:19 all the young ones in the congregation.
00:04:22 And in doing so,
00:04:24 they have actually improved their zeal
00:04:28 and participation in the ministry as well.
00:04:31 Jehovah is using us in a way that allows us
00:04:34 to be able to assist the congregation
00:04:36 and, at the same time, this congregation
00:04:39 is taking care and strengthening and helping us.
00:04:42 And when we get the focus off of ourselves
00:04:45 and onto them and to those that are in the field,
00:04:49 immediately Jehovah blesses us with joy.
00:04:52 They have taken that mindset
00:04:55 of working hard for Jehovah at Bethel
00:04:59 and now, really, transitioning to working hard for Jehovah
00:05:03 in the Macedonia Congregation.
00:05:07 Do you have special pioneers in your congregation or circuit?
00:05:11 If so, spend time with them.
00:05:14 Parents, help your young ones come to know them.
00:05:19 All of us can let them know
00:05:21 how much we appreciate their example of faith.
00:05:25 Special pioneers are willing to serve wherever they are needed
00:05:29 in their own country or, in some cases, in other lands.
00:05:34 So how does someone become a special pioneer?
00:05:37 Well, in most cases,
00:05:39 it begins when a regular pioneer attends the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:05:44 Based on the needs of the field,
00:05:46 some graduates of the school are appointed as temporary special pioneers
00:05:50 for up to three years.
00:05:53 Afterward, some might continue as special pioneers
00:05:57 or be invited to serve as field missionaries.
00:06:01 When I first heard that I was assigned as a temporary special pioneer,
00:06:05 I was shocked.
00:06:07 I was a little bit scared, very overwhelmed, but mostly excited.
00:06:11 I’ve really enjoyed being available for the friends
00:06:14 —being available for different service times,
00:06:16 for phone calls, or things like that.
00:06:18 It’s just really been nice to support the congregation with more of my time.
00:06:23 I would call it the experience
00:06:25 that we never knew we wanted
00:06:28 because I never, never thought
00:06:31 that it could be a goal of ours.
00:06:34 We never thought we would do it.
00:06:36 We didn’t understand or know too much about it.
00:06:39 Because it’s called special pioneering, I think in our heads,
00:06:42 before we were like: ‘Oh, special people do that.
00:06:44 ‘They’re just really incredible at the ministry.
00:06:46 So that’s who special pioneer.’
00:06:49 So to get this assignment, we realized, “Oh, regular people
00:06:52 can be special pioneers.”
00:06:55 So, really, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:06:58 has become an essential doorway
00:07:01 for those wanting to be used more fully by Jehovah’s organization.
00:07:05 The School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:07:07 was like a power station that gave us strength
00:07:09 to continue in our ministry.
00:07:12 The two months of training really helped me to be more fluent in the “pure language.”
00:07:16 And I felt newfound strength when I returned to preach
00:07:19 in the foreign-language field after graduation.
00:07:22 Not only does it provide you with the training,
00:07:25 but it helps you to be able to get even closer to Jehovah,
00:07:28 more than you had ever imagined before.
00:07:31 Because it’s the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:07:33 we imagined we were going to be practicing preaching every day,
00:07:36 but the school just helped us with our relationship with Jehovah.
00:07:40 We felt so built up.
00:07:42 We would go anywhere.
00:07:43 Naturally, many would prefer to choose their own assignment.
00:07:48 However, when we put ourselves in Jehovah’s hands through his organization,
00:07:53 we receive valuable training
00:07:55 and find the best place to grow spiritually.
00:07:59 We feel great joy in foreign-language service where we express
00:08:03 Jehovah’s love and goodness to foreigners
00:08:06 who have been through so much in this tough world.
00:08:10 I am really happy because although I am physically in Korea,
00:08:14 it feels like I’m doing missionary work.
00:08:16 I love my assignment very, very much.
00:08:19 There’s just a tremendous amount of joy and blessings
00:08:22 that come about in serving others.
00:08:24 Special pioneering is really the best life ever
00:08:29 —just to be able to give your all
00:08:31 to Jehovah in every way.
00:08:34 I’m excited to see where Jehovah wants me next.
00:08:43 As we’ve just seen, with many recent SKE graduates
00:08:47 being assigned to the work,
00:08:49 special pioneering isn’t out of reach for young couples
00:08:53 or single ones—even those in their 20’s.
00:08:58 And there is a real need for more to serve
00:09:00 in this special capacity.
00:09:04 So you younger brothers and sisters,
00:09:07 could you set special pioneering as a goal?
00:09:11 It can give you the training and experience you’ll need
00:09:15 to be more useful to Jehovah.
00:09:18 You would find it to be a wonderful career.
00:09:22 Of course, not all of us can be special pioneers,
00:09:27 but we can support them and their efforts.
00:09:31 Their steadfastness, determination,
00:09:33 and zeal make them a real treasure.
00:09:38 To all of our special pioneers,
00:09:40 we echo the words of the apostle Paul
00:09:43 to the Thessalonians when he wrote:
00:09:46 “We continually remember your faithful work,
00:09:49 your loving labor, and your endurance.”
