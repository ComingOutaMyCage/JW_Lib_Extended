00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:16.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul was busy preaching

00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:19.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the bustling city of Corinth,

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
the account at Acts 18:5 says

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Paul began to be
intensely occupied with the word,”

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
or as the study note
in the <i>New World Translation</i>  puts it,

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:34.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fully absorbed in preaching the word.”

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:37.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words well describe

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:40.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
the thousands of brothers and sisters

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:44.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving today as special pioneers.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like Paul,
they are “fully absorbed” in their ministry.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spend about 100 hours
in service every month.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
With limited time for secular work,

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:01.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
they receive a modest allowance
to help with their expenses.

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:06.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us are familiar
with regular and auxiliary pioneers.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you serve as one.

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what makes
this special pioneer arrangement unique?

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:15.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this report,

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:19.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s look at the important role
special pioneers have played

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:21.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to play

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:25.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
in supporting and expanding
the disciple-making work

00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:28.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consider what we can do

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:31.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support these dear faithful ones.

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:34.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
The special pioneer arrangement

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
began more than 85 years ago.

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:44.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the 1937 convention in Columbus, Ohio,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford explained that a group

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
of about 200 pioneers

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:52.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
were being chosen to serve

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:55.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
as special pioneers.

00:01:55.687 --> 00:01:59.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their assignment
was to take the lead in using

00:01:59.024 --> 00:02:02.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the most powerful preaching tools

00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:06.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the era—the portable phonograph.

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:09.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part of the prophecy shows
that the people of this day

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:12.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are of goodwill toward God
and who want to do right

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give heed to his warning
given by his Witnesses.

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:19.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
By this time,
brothers had been using phonographs

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:23.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to play short Bible messages for a few years

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
but usually only after being invited
inside someone’s home.

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:31.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
The newly appointed special pioneers

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
were to spearhead

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new use of the phonograph,

00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:38.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
presenting the recorded messages

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:41.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
right on the householder’s doorstep

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:45.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
after just a few words of introduction.

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:49.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before long, tens of thousands of phonographs

00:02:49.787 --> 00:02:52.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in use in the field.

00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:54.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Special pioneers also took the lead

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:58.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
in following up with interested persons
and conducting Bible studies,

00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:00.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they focused mainly

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:03.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
on preaching in big cities.

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:04.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
But within a few years,

00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:06.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scope was expanded.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their assignment would now include

00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:09.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
remote territories.

00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:13.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of the tireless work

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those intrepid special pioneers,

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:17.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
hundreds of new congregations were formed.

00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:21.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, that initial group

00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:22.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 200 special pioneers

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
has grown to more than 27,000

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they continue to play
a key role in opening up

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
new territories all over the world.

00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:37.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some who served faithfully
for many years at Bethel

00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:41.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in other forms of special
full-time service, such as the circuit work,

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:44.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
are assigned as special pioneers.

00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:48.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their experience and zeal
are a real benefit to their congregations.

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:53.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after serving
at Bethel for over 30 years,

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:54.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laurie and I received the call

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:55.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the branch office

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we were being reassigned

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
as special pioneers to the field.

00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:01.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we met with them,

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was a little emotional.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:05.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew there was a good possibility.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, it was Jehovah’s direction.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We took a picture with them afterward.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have that as a really nice memory aid

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the new chapter of our life.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they moved in,
it seemed like they adopted

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the young ones in the congregation.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in doing so,

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:28.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have actually improved their zeal

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
and participation in the ministry as well.

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:34.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is using us in a way that allows us

00:04:34.109 --> 00:04:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to assist the congregation

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:39.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, at the same time, this congregation

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:42.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
is taking care
and strengthening and helping us.

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we get the focus off of ourselves

00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:49.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and onto them
and to those that are in the field,

00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:52.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
immediately Jehovah blesses us with joy.

00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have taken that mindset

00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:59.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
of working hard for Jehovah at Bethel

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:03.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now, really, transitioning
to working hard for Jehovah

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Macedonia Congregation.

00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have special pioneers
in your congregation or circuit?

00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:14.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, spend time with them.

00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, help your young ones
come to know them.

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:21.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us can let them know

00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:24.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much we appreciate
their example of faith.

00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:29.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Special pioneers are willing
to serve wherever they are needed

00:05:29.502 --> 00:05:34.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their own country or, in some cases,
in other lands.

00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:37.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does someone
become a special pioneer?

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:39.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in most cases,

00:05:39.763 --> 00:05:44.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
it begins when a regular pioneer attends
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:05:44.852 --> 00:05:46.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on the needs of the field,

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
some graduates of the school
are appointed as temporary special pioneers

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:53.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
for up to three years.

00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:57.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Afterward, some might continue
as special pioneers

00:05:57.198 --> 00:06:00.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be invited to serve as field missionaries.

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:05.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I first heard that I was assigned
as a temporary special pioneer,

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:07.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was shocked.

00:06:07.126 --> 00:06:11.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a little bit scared,
very overwhelmed, but mostly excited.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve really enjoyed
being available for the friends

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:16.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being available for different service times,

00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:18.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
for phone calls, or things like that.

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just really been nice to support
the congregation with more of my time.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would call it the experience

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we never knew we wanted

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:31.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I never, never thought

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:34.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it could be a goal of ours.

00:06:34.364 --> 00:06:36.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never thought we would do it.

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:39.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t understand
or know too much about it.

00:06:39.453 --> 00:06:42.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because it’s called special pioneering,
I think in our heads,

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:44.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we were like:
‘Oh, special people do that.

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They’re just really incredible
at the ministry.

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s who special pioneer.’

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to get this assignment,
we realized, “Oh, regular people

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be special pioneers.”

00:06:55.261 --> 00:06:58.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, really,
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:06:58.557 --> 00:07:01.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
has become an essential doorway

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:05.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those wanting to be used
more fully by Jehovah’s organization.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
The School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:09.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
was like a power station that gave us strength

00:07:09.986 --> 00:07:12.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue in our ministry.

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:16.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two months of training really helped me
to be more fluent in the “pure language.”

00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:19.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I felt newfound strength
when I returned to preach

00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:22.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the foreign-language field
after graduation.

00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:25.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only does it provide
you with the training,

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it helps you to be able to get
even closer to Jehovah,

00:07:28.756 --> 00:07:31.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than you had ever imagined before.

00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:33.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because it’s
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:36.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
we imagined we were
going to be practicing preaching every day,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the school just helped us
with our relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:42.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt so built up.

00:07:42.104 --> 00:07:43.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would go anywhere.

00:07:43.856 --> 00:07:48.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally, many would prefer to choose
their own assignment.

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:53.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when we put ourselves
in Jehovah’s hands through his organization,

00:07:53.491 --> 00:07:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
we receive valuable training

00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:59.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find the best place to grow spiritually.

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel great joy
in foreign-language service where we express

00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:06.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love and goodness to foreigners

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:10.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have been through so much
in this tough world.

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:14.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am really happy
because although I am physically in Korea,

00:08:14.764 --> 00:08:16.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
it feels like I’m doing missionary work.

00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:19.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love my assignment very, very much.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s just a tremendous
amount of joy and blessings

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
that come about in serving others.

00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:29.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Special pioneering
is really the best life ever

00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just to be able to give your all

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:34.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah in every way.

00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:38.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m excited to see where Jehovah
wants me next.

00:08:43.587 --> 00:08:47.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve just seen,
with many recent SKE graduates

00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:49.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
being assigned to the work,

00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
special pioneering isn’t out of reach
for young couples

00:08:53.556 --> 00:08:57.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
or single ones—even those in their 20’s.

00:08:58.311 --> 00:09:00.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is a real need for more to serve

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:04.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this special capacity.

00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you younger brothers and sisters,

00:09:07.363 --> 00:09:10.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
could you set special pioneering as a goal?

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can give you the training
and experience you’ll need

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:18.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be more useful to Jehovah.

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:21.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
You would find it to be a wonderful career.

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:27.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, not all of us
can be special pioneers,

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can support them and their efforts.

00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:33.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their steadfastness, determination,

00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:38.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and zeal make them a real treasure.

00:09:38.188 --> 00:09:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
To all of our special pioneers,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
we echo the words of the apostle Paul

00:09:43.318 --> 00:09:46.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Thessalonians when he wrote:

00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We continually remember your faithful work,

00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:53.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
your loving labor, and your endurance.”
