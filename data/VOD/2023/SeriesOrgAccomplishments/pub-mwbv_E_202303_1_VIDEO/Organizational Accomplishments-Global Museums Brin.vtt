At Deuteronomy 32:7,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses urged the Israelites to pause

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflect on their spiritual heritage.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Remember the days of old;

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider the years of past generations.”

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our museums at world headquarters
help us to do just that

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to learn about our history

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consider how Jehovah has blessed

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and guided his people
through these last days.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, with the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
visits to the museums had to be put on hold.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the work of the Museum Department
has kept right on going!

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:01.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Museum Department
has been busier than ever.

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this report, we will provide an update

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the work to create beautiful new museums

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
at dozens of branches.

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
These museums will help
our brothers and sisters worldwide

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
to explore the history of the Bible

00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our rich spiritual heritage.

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each museum project starts

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a branch office

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
writes the Coordinators’ Committee

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
to request approval to develop a new museum.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:43.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once approved,
the Coordinators’ Committee

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides direction
about the type of museum to develop.

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:48.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
The museum might present

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:50.923 line:10% position:50% align:center
the history of the Bible

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.342 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the languages of the branch territory

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.511 line:10% position:50% align:center
or a history museum showing

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.554 line:10% position:50% align:center
how the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.598 line:10% position:50% align:center
developed in the branch territory

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:03.018 line:10% position:50% align:center
or displays that give

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.104 line:10% position:50% align:center
a behind-the-scenes look

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:07.523 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Bethel operations in the local branch.

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme chosen for our museum was

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This Is the Heritage of Jehovah’s Servants.”

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were helped to see the benefits
of dividing the exhibition by time periods,

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:20.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
since it both aids in teaching
and lends to the theme.

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so grateful for the help we’ve received

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Coordinators’ Committee
and the Museum Department.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
An increased appreciation for everything
that Jehovah has done for his people

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be seen in the eyes of the visitors.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
If all these projects are coordinated
through the Museum Department,

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
does that mean they’ll all be the same?

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is most definitely no.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
When developing exhibits,

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Museum Department

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t use a cookie-cutter,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
or one-size-fits-all, approach.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:53.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
We want the visitors to the exhibit

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:55.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
to experience the local history

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.614 line:10% position:50% align:center
and culture of the branch territory

00:02:57.614 --> 00:02:59.366 line:10% position:50% align:center
and to be encouraged by it.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:00.367 line:10% position:50% align:center
So even though we do have

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.786 line:10% position:50% align:center
a set of standard exhibit components we use,

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:04.538 line:10% position:50% align:center
we work very closely

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:05.706 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the local exhibit team

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:06.915 line:10% position:50% align:center
to make sure that each exhibit

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:08.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
is unique and enjoyable.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible museum that opened
at the Argentina branch in 2019

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a good example of how museum content

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
is tailored to the local branch territory.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:24.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the mid-19th century

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the beginning of the 20th century,

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:28.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Argentina received millions of immigrants

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all over Europe.

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:34.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many of them brought with them
their Bibles in their native languages

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the same Bibles with which
some of them later learned the truth.

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why it is so significant
that our new Bible exhibition contains

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
copies in Italian, Armenian,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Hebrew, among others.

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Argentina, there are also many people

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
who speak different indigenous languages.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore,
the history of the Bible in this country

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not be complete
if we did not include in our exhibition

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
modern translations into these languages,

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:06.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Wichí, Toba,

00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:09.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilagá, and Mocoví, among others.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:14.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Museum Department was also working

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a new museum at the Scandinavia branch.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was also a Bible museum
but with a very unique story.

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:29.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our exhibition
on how the Bible and God’s name

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been preserved in Scandinavia,

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:34.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show Bibles

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all the Scandinavian languages

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
that use the name Jehovah

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is, in Greenlandic, Icelandic,

00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:46.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faeroese, Danish, Norwegian,

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:49.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Swedish, (yes) even in Saami.

00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:54.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two oldest complete Bibles we have

00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:59.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the <i>Gustav Vasa Bible</i>  from 1541

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:03.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the <i>Christian III Bible</i>  from 1550.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:10.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly,
these Bibles do not contain Jehovah’s name.

00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:14.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
But interestingly, the 1550 Bible

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:17.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a handwritten note that in Latin

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
explains the meaning of the name Jehovah.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Branch Committee is so grateful

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
to world headquarters

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the direction given in 2019
while preparing

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:35.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible exhibit at the France branch.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:39.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Museum Department

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:42.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
kindly offered to display an original copy

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 1535 French Olivétan Bible.

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:51.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
This rare Bible is one
of the most significant Bibles on display.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only is it
the first Bible to be translated

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the original languages into French

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it also contains
the divine name, Jehovah.

00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see,

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
our museums worldwide are providing

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
faith-strengthening divine education.

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:17.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes much work to do so.

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a real team effort.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Coordinators’ Committee
provides direction on the content

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:28.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
while Museum Department personnel
provide training

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:31.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
and support
for the local branch exhibit teams.

00:06:31.912 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
And once concepts are approved,

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:37.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Worldwide Design/Construction Department

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:39.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Regional Design/Construction Department

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
get involved
in organizing the construction work.

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:48.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Museum Department helped us

00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:50.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
to select a suitable location

00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:51.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would meet the standards

00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:52.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a real museum.

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:56.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Worldwide Design/Construction Department

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
reviewed the construction process and budget.

00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:01.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
With their assistance, we built a museum

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really is a powerful tool

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:07.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to instill love for Jehovah and his Word.

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:12.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past,
we have had various exhibits at the branch,

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:15.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this exhibit isn’t like anything

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:17.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have experienced.

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:22.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Branch Committee
and the entire Bethel family

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:23.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
were so impressed

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how Jehovah
has made this project possible.

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:32.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
The story of our museums
would not be complete

00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
without mentioning
another important contributor—you!

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:40.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
—because many of the rare Bibles

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:43.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and historical items
that are featured in our museums

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:47.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
were donated by you brothers and sisters.

00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:50.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for your generosity.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you would like to share an item with us,

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:55.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
please feel free to contact

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:57.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Museum Department

00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:00.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
at world headquarters in Warwick.

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:01.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
If possible,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
please include a photograph of your item.

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:08.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is blessing the work being done

00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:11.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide these inspiring museums

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:14.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:18.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of September 2021,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
10 museums have already opened

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:25.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have more than 35 under development

00:08:25.317 --> 00:08:29.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the process of being built.
