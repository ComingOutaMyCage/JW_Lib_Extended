00:00:13 At Deuteronomy 32:7,
00:00:16 Moses urged the Israelites to pause
00:00:20 and reflect on their spiritual heritage.
00:00:23 He said:
00:00:24 “Remember the days of old;
00:00:27 consider the years of past generations.”
00:00:31 Our museums at world headquarters help us to do just that
00:00:35 —to learn about our history
00:00:38 and consider how Jehovah has blessed
00:00:41 and guided his people through these last days.
00:00:45 Of course, with the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:00:48 visits to the museums had to be put on hold.
00:00:54 But the work of the Museum Department has kept right on going!
00:00:59 In fact,
00:01:01 the Museum Department has been busier than ever.
00:01:06 In this report, we will provide an update
00:01:09 on the work to create beautiful new museums
00:01:13 at dozens of branches.
00:01:15 These museums will help our brothers and sisters worldwide
00:01:20 to explore the history of the Bible
00:01:23 and our rich spiritual heritage.
00:01:30 Each museum project starts
00:01:33 when a branch office
00:01:34 writes the Coordinators’ Committee
00:01:36 to request approval to develop a new museum.
00:01:40 Once approved, the Coordinators’ Committee
00:01:43 provides direction about the type of museum to develop.
00:01:47 The museum might present
00:01:48 the history of the Bible
00:01:50 in the languages of the branch territory
00:01:53 or a history museum showing
00:01:55 how the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:57 developed in the branch territory
00:02:01 or displays that give
00:02:03 a behind-the-scenes look
00:02:05 at Bethel operations in the local branch.
00:02:07 The theme chosen for our museum was
00:02:10 “This Is the Heritage of Jehovah’s Servants.”
00:02:13 We were helped to see the benefits of dividing the exhibition by time periods,
00:02:17 since it both aids in teaching and lends to the theme.
00:02:20 We’re so grateful for the help we’ve received
00:02:23 from the Coordinators’ Committee and the Museum Department.
00:02:26 An increased appreciation for everything that Jehovah has done for his people
00:02:31 can be seen in the eyes of the visitors.
00:02:35 If all these projects are coordinated through the Museum Department,
00:02:39 does that mean they’ll all be the same?
00:02:42 The answer is most definitely no.
00:02:45 When developing exhibits,
00:02:46 the Museum Department
00:02:47 doesn’t use a cookie-cutter,
00:02:49 or one-size-fits-all, approach.
00:02:51 We want the visitors to the exhibit
00:02:53 to experience the local history
00:02:55 and culture of the branch territory
00:02:57 and to be encouraged by it.
00:02:59 So even though we do have
00:03:00 a set of standard exhibit components we use,
00:03:02 we work very closely
00:03:04 with the local exhibit team
00:03:05 to make sure that each exhibit
00:03:06 is unique and enjoyable.
00:03:09 The Bible museum that opened at the Argentina branch in 2019
00:03:14 is a good example of how museum content
00:03:18 is tailored to the local branch territory.
00:03:22 From the mid-19th century
00:03:24 to the beginning of the 20th century,
00:03:26 Argentina received millions of immigrants
00:03:28 from all over Europe.
00:03:30 And many of them brought with them their Bibles in their native languages
00:03:34 —the same Bibles with which some of them later learned the truth.
00:03:39 That is why it is so significant that our new Bible exhibition contains
00:03:44 copies in Italian, Armenian,
00:03:47 and Hebrew, among others.
00:03:51 In Argentina, there are also many people
00:03:53 who speak different indigenous languages.
00:03:56 Therefore, the history of the Bible in this country
00:03:58 would not be complete if we did not include in our exhibition
00:04:02 modern translations into these languages,
00:04:04 such as Wichí, Toba,
00:04:06 Pilagá, and Mocoví, among others.
00:04:12 The Museum Department was also working
00:04:14 on a new museum at the Scandinavia branch.
00:04:18 This was also a Bible museum but with a very unique story.
00:04:26 In our exhibition on how the Bible and God’s name
00:04:29 have been preserved in Scandinavia,
00:04:33 we show Bibles
00:04:34 in all the Scandinavian languages
00:04:37 that use the name Jehovah
00:04:39 —that is, in Greenlandic, Icelandic,
00:04:43 Faeroese, Danish, Norwegian,
00:04:46 Swedish, (yes) even in Saami.
00:04:51 The two oldest complete Bibles we have
00:04:56 are the Gustav Vasa Bible  from 1541
00:04:59 and the Christian III Bible  from 1550.
00:05:05 Sadly, these Bibles do not contain Jehovah’s name.
00:05:10 But interestingly, the 1550 Bible
00:05:14 has a handwritten note that in Latin
00:05:17 explains the meaning of the name Jehovah.
00:05:26 Our Branch Committee is so grateful
00:05:28 to world headquarters
00:05:30 for the direction given in 2019 while preparing
00:05:33 the Bible exhibit at the France branch.
00:05:37 The Museum Department
00:05:39 kindly offered to display an original copy
00:05:42 of the 1535 French Olivétan Bible.
00:05:47 This rare Bible is one of the most significant Bibles on display.
00:05:55 Not only is it the first Bible to be translated
00:05:58 from the original languages into French
00:06:02 but it also contains the divine name, Jehovah.
00:06:07 As you can see,
00:06:09 our museums worldwide are providing
00:06:12 faith-strengthening divine education.
00:06:15 It takes much work to do so.
00:06:17 It’s a real team effort.
00:06:20 The Coordinators’ Committee provides direction on the content
00:06:24 while Museum Department personnel provide training
00:06:28 and support for the local branch exhibit teams.
00:06:31 And once concepts are approved,
00:06:34 the Worldwide Design/Construction Department
00:06:37 and Regional Design/Construction Department
00:06:39 get involved in organizing the construction work.
00:06:46 The Museum Department helped us
00:06:48 to select a suitable location
00:06:50 that would meet the standards
00:06:51 of a real museum.
00:06:53 The Worldwide Design/Construction Department
00:06:56 reviewed the construction process and budget.
00:06:59 With their assistance, we built a museum
00:07:01 that really is a powerful tool
00:07:04 to instill love for Jehovah and his Word.
00:07:08 In the past, we have had various exhibits at the branch,
00:07:12 but this exhibit isn’t like anything
00:07:15 we have experienced.
00:07:19 Our Branch Committee and the entire Bethel family
00:07:22 were so impressed
00:07:23 to see how Jehovah has made this project possible.
00:07:28 The story of our museums would not be complete
00:07:32 without mentioning another important contributor—you!
00:07:37 —because many of the rare Bibles
00:07:40 and historical items that are featured in our museums
00:07:43 were donated by you brothers and sisters.
00:07:47 Thank you for your generosity.
00:07:51 If you would like to share an item with us,
00:07:54 please feel free to contact
00:07:55 the Museum Department
00:07:57 at world headquarters in Warwick.
00:08:00 If possible,
00:08:01 please include a photograph of your item.
00:08:05 Jehovah is blessing the work being done
00:08:08 to provide these inspiring museums
00:08:11 to the worldwide brotherhood.
00:08:15 As of September 2021,
00:08:18 10 museums have already opened
00:08:21 and we have more than 35 under development
00:08:25 or in the process of being built.
00:08:29 Some of the next to open will be
00:08:31 at the Belgium, Britain,
00:08:33 Central America, Czech-Slovak,
00:08:36 Finland, Italy,
00:08:39 Japan, and Nigeria branches.
00:08:43 These museums
00:08:44 are powerful teaching tools
00:08:47 that bring our history and the history of the Bible to life.
00:08:52 So as soon as conditions allow it,
00:08:55 please come and explore our museums for yourself.
00:09:00 When you do, we feel confident you’ll be moved to say
00:09:05 as did the psalmist
00:09:06 at Psalm 77:11-13:
00:09:11 “I will remember the works of Jah;
00:09:14 “I will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago.
00:09:19 “And I will meditate on all your activity . . .
00:09:23 What god is as great as you?”
