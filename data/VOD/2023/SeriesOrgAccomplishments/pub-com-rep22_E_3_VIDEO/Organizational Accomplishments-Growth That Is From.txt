00:00:13 Under the leadership of Jesus,
00:00:15 the harvest work is being accomplished.
00:00:19 An important part
00:00:20 of supporting the harvest work
00:00:22 is constructing facilities that are used to educate
00:00:25 and care for the great influx
00:00:27 of those “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
00:00:33 Therefore, an adjustment had to be made to meet the organization’s growing needs.
00:00:40 Back in 2013,
00:00:42 the Governing Body concluded
00:00:44 that the existing arrangements
00:00:46 for providing facilities
00:00:48 would not be able to keep pace
00:00:51 with the needs of the organization.
00:00:54 Thus, we formed
00:00:56 the Worldwide Design/Construction Department
00:01:00 with the objective of consolidating
00:01:03 all of this work into one department
00:01:06 under the direction of the Publishing Committee.
00:01:10 We had several goals for this new department.
00:01:13 The first was producing more facilities
00:01:17 in the most efficient and economical manner.
00:01:21 Second, we asked them
00:01:23 to look for ways to simplify and streamline the work
00:01:27 so that projects could be delivered
00:01:30 in the shortest possible time.
00:01:34 Third, we wanted them to provide solutions
00:01:37 that were flexible
00:01:39 and could provide the best overall value for the organization.
00:01:44 That would help us to adapt quickly
00:01:48 as our needs change.
00:01:51 In addition to Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch offices,
00:01:55 we need remote translation offices,
00:01:58 media studios,
00:02:00 and theocratic school facilities around the world.
00:02:05 Over the past ten years,
00:02:07 how has the Worldwide Design/Construction Department,
00:02:10 or WDC, been able to keep pace
00:02:13 with the accelerating needs
00:02:15 of the preaching and teaching work?
00:02:18 Our work especially benefits from the continued application
00:02:22 of a basic Bible principle
00:02:24 found at Colossians 2:19:
00:02:26 “The whole body is supplied
00:02:29 “and harmoniously joined together . . .
00:02:32 and made to grow with the growth that is from God.”
00:02:37 By remaining “harmoniously joined together,”
00:02:40 communicating and collaborating with one another in unity,
00:02:44 we are in a better position to respond to
00:02:47 and support Christ’s headship.
00:02:50 Doing so enables us to experience
00:02:53 “the growth that is from God.”
00:02:56 Let’s now go behind the scenes of a few recent projects
00:03:01 to see how a more flexible approach,
00:03:03 along with early and ongoing collaboration,
00:03:07 is leading to better results
00:03:09 —an evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.
00:03:13 We have been renting about 65 apartments
00:03:16 for the needs of the France branch.
00:03:19 But, sadly,
00:03:21 their quality was not consistent
00:03:23 and it involved much work to manage.
00:03:26 So our Branch Committee
00:03:28 considered developing new residences on Bethel properties
00:03:33 instead of renting.
00:03:35 Currently, at the Central America branch,
00:03:37 we translate into approximately 80 languages.
00:03:41 Because we need to do translation work into so many languages,
00:03:45 we currently require 66
00:03:48 new remote translation offices.
00:03:50 But getting these offices
00:03:52 requires a lot of work.
00:03:55 And at the same time, we needed to keep supplying Kingdom Halls,
00:03:59 which are urgently needed in the region.
00:04:01 So the amount of work involved
00:04:03 in addressing both needs seemed too great.
00:04:07 Here in Brazil, we have a great need
00:04:10 for more men and women that can help support
00:04:12 the congregations and in the field.
00:04:15 Thankfully, we have many young brothers and sisters
00:04:18 that want to expand their service to Jehovah and have applied for SKE.
00:04:23 As a matter of fact, we receive between
00:04:24 2,000 and 2,500 applications per year.
00:04:28 The need for another permanent school became very obvious.
00:04:32 When the WDC receives direction from the Governing Body, we pray
00:04:36 for guidance, do our research, and consult
00:04:39 with local brothers.
00:04:41 Then we proceed with an eye on where Jehovah’s spirit
00:04:45 is leading a project
00:04:47 or even redirecting it.
00:04:49 With what results?
00:04:50 In the end, following the recommendation of world headquarters,
00:04:55 we ended up purchasing residential apartments
00:04:58 built by property developers that we could easily sell
00:05:01 should our future needs change.
00:05:05 The Governing Body gave its approval
00:05:07 to have a group specializing in providing these
00:05:10 remote translation offices.
00:05:15 The Project Development Group
00:05:17 communicates with the WDC.
00:05:20 The WDC then communicates
00:05:23 with different groups at world headquarters:
00:05:26 the Service Committee, the Writing Committee,
00:05:29 the Publishing Committee, and the Translation Services Department.
00:05:34 The Project Development Group also works closely
00:05:37 with the local translation team, the Purchasing Department,
00:05:41 the Legal Department, the Service Department,
00:05:45 and with many other departments here at the branch.
00:05:49 We saw Jehovah’s hand in that,
00:05:51 because it allowed us to move forward
00:05:53 with the work without disregarding
00:05:56 the great need we had in the region for Kingdom Halls.
00:06:01 Well, we appreciated the good direction we received from the WDC
00:06:04 to have a flexible approach in searching for properties,
00:06:08 not just looking for property in which we could build a new structure
00:06:12 but also for buildings that were already available
00:06:15 that could be renovated for that purpose.
00:06:17 We were able to find a hotel that fit our needs exactly,
00:06:21 both because of its location and its size.
00:06:25 The brothers received direction from the WDC
00:06:28 to use Bible principles in the process.
00:06:32 At one point, the negotiations weren’t going very well.
00:06:35 The brothers took a break, they said a prayer to Jehovah,
00:06:38 and they came back with Bible in hand.
00:06:41 They showed a Bible principle to the owner
00:06:44 that showed that we want to be honest in everything we do.
00:06:47 The owner was so impressed
00:06:49 that from then on, the negotiations went very smoothly.
00:06:53 As a result, we were able to obtain that property for a fair market price
00:06:57 and additional funds were able
00:07:00 to be used in order to extend that property
00:07:02 to have yet a third class as part of the complex.
00:07:07 The new directions given
00:07:08 by the WDC Department
00:07:10 have been a real blessing
00:07:12 to our residential projects here in France.
00:07:14 Our branch has a long history of theocratic construction.
00:07:18 However, never before
00:07:20 have the projects of this size moved so quickly.
00:07:23 The Branch Committee is impressed with the quality
00:07:25 of what is being developed and planned,
00:07:28 and we’ve come to appreciate these new approaches.
00:07:30 We see the positive effects
00:07:33 of having the translation office
00:07:36 where the language is spoken.
00:07:38 But the fact that a place was purchased
00:07:42 and where it was built  (for that particular aspect of the work
00:07:45 they’re in the right locations and they have the right equipment),
00:07:49 it makes it a lot easier
00:07:51 for the brothers to be able to do their work.
00:07:53 So being in these RTOs is a blessing from Jehovah.
00:07:58 The new schools building
00:08:00 is designed to accommodate
00:08:01 more than 250 students
00:08:03 of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers each year.
00:08:06 Certainly, a building dedicated for schools
00:08:10 is well worth the effort and the investment
00:08:14 of those that work on the project.
00:08:16 This greatly strengthens my faith
00:08:19 that when Jehovah desires something,
00:08:21 there are no obstacles that can prevent his purpose from happening.
00:08:27 Well, we’ve certainly seen Jehovah’s blessing
00:08:31 on this arrangement.
00:08:33 Good planning, communication,
00:08:36 and collaboration
00:08:38 are allowing us
00:08:39 to prioritize and expedite work
00:08:44 that directly advances the global preaching
00:08:46 and teaching work.
00:08:49 The Governing Body would like to assure
00:08:52 all of you dear brothers and sisters
00:08:55 of our deep love and appreciation for you.
00:09:01 We thank everyone
00:09:03 for all that you do to support us
00:09:06 in advancing Kingdom interests
00:09:09 during these exciting but challenging
00:09:14 final days of the last days.
00:09:18 When it comes to providing facilities to support the work,
00:09:22 one size doesn’t fit all.
00:09:25 By being adaptable and responsive to the needs,
00:09:29 the circumstances, the insight of others,
00:09:32 and the leadings of Jehovah’s spirit,
00:09:35 we show that we are following Jesus’ leadership
00:09:39 and are thus “made to grow with the growth that is from God.”
00:09:44 This is preparing us
00:09:46 for even greater building and educational projects
00:09:49 in the Paradise soon to come.
