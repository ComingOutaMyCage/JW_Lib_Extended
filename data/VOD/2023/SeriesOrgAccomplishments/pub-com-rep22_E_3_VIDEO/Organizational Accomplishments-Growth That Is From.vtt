Under the leadership of Jesus,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
the harvest work is being accomplished.

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
An important part

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
of supporting the harvest work

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
is constructing facilities
that are used to educate 

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and care for the great influx

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, an adjustment had to be made
to meet the organization’s growing needs.

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 2013,

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body concluded

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the existing arrangements

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
for providing facilities

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not be able to keep pace

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:54.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the needs of the organization.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we formed

00:00:56.327 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Worldwide Design/Construction Department

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the objective of consolidating

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of this work into one department

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction
of the Publishing Committee.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had several goals for this new department.

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:17.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first was producing more facilities

00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:21.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the most efficient and economical manner.

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we asked them

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
to look for ways
to simplify and streamline the work

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that projects could be delivered

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the shortest possible time.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we wanted them to provide solutions

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were flexible

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and could provide the best overall value
for the organization.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would help us to adapt quickly

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:51.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our needs change.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to Kingdom Halls,
Assembly Halls, and branch offices,

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:58.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need remote translation offices,

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
media studios,

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and theocratic school facilities
around the world.

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the past ten years,

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
how has
the Worldwide Design/Construction Department,

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:13.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
or WDC, been able to keep pace 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the accelerating needs

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:17.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the preaching and teaching work?

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our work especially benefits
from the continued application

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:24.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a basic Bible principle

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Colossians 2:19:

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:29.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The whole body is supplied

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and harmoniously joined together . . .

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made to grow
with the growth that is from God.”

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:40.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
By remaining “harmoniously joined together,”

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:44.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
communicating and collaborating
with one another in unity,

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:47.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are in a better position to respond to

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:49.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and support Christ’s headship.

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:53.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing so enables us to experience

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:56.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the growth that is from God.”

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now go behind the scenes
of a few recent projects

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how a more flexible approach,

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with early and ongoing collaboration,

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
is leading to better results

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been renting about 65 apartments

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the needs of the France branch.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, sadly,

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:23.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
their quality was not consistent

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:26.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it involved much work to manage.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our Branch Committee

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
considered developing new residences
on Bethel properties

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of renting.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:37.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently, at the Central America branch,

00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:41.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
we translate into approximately 80 languages.

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:45.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we need to do translation work
into so many languages,

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
we currently require 66

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
new remote translation offices.

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
But getting these offices

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires a lot of work.

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:59.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the same time,
we needed to keep supplying Kingdom Halls,

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are urgently needed in the region.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the amount of work involved

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
in addressing both needs seemed too great.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in Brazil, we have a great need

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
for more men and women that can help support

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregations and in the field.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, we have many
young brothers and sisters

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:23.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
that want to expand their service to Jehovah
and have applied for SKE.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact, we receive between

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:28.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
2,000 and 2,500 applications per year.

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
The need for another permanent school
became very obvious.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:36.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the WDC receives direction
from the Governing Body, we pray

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
for guidance, do our research, and consult

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
with local brothers.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we proceed
with an eye on where Jehovah’s spirit

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
is leading a project

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even redirecting it.

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
With what results?

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the end, following the recommendation
of world headquarters,

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
we ended up purchasing residential apartments

00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:01.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
built by property developers
that we could easily sell

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
should our future needs change.

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:07.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body gave its approval

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:10.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a group specializing
in providing these

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
remote translation offices.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Project Development Group

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:20.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
communicates with the WDC.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:23.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
The WDC then communicates

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:25.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
with different groups at world headquarters:

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:29.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Service Committee, the Writing Committee,

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Publishing Committee,
and the Translation Services Department.

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:37.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Project Development Group
also works closely

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:41.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the local translation team,
the Purchasing Department,

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:45.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Legal Department, the Service Department,

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:48.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with many other departments
here at the branch.

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:51.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw Jehovah’s hand in that,

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it allowed us to move forward

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the work without disregarding

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:59.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
the great need we had in the region
for Kingdom Halls.

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we appreciated the good direction
we received from the WDC

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:08.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a flexible approach
in searching for properties,

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:12.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just looking for property
in which we could build a new structure

00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:15.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for buildings
that were already available

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:17.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could be renovated for that purpose.

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to find a hotel
that fit our needs exactly,

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:25.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
both because of its location and its size.

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:28.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers received direction from the WDC

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use Bible principles in the process.

00:06:32.037 --> 00:06:35.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one point, the negotiations
weren’t going very well.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers took a break,
they said a prayer to Jehovah,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they came back with Bible in hand.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed a Bible principle
to the owner

00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:47.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
that showed that we want to be honest
in everything we do.

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
The owner was so impressed

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:53.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that from then on,
the negotiations went very smoothly.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:57.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, we were able to obtain
that property for a fair market price

00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:00.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and additional funds were able

00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:02.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be used in order to extend that property

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:06.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have yet a third class
as part of the complex.

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:08.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new directions given

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the WDC Department

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been a real blessing

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our residential projects here in France.

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:18.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our branch has a long history
of theocratic construction.

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:20.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, never before

00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:23.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
have the projects of this size
moved so quickly.

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:25.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Branch Committee
is impressed with the quality

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:28.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what is being developed and planned,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve come to appreciate
these new approaches.

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:33.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see the positive effects

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:36.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
of having the translation office

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:38.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the language is spoken.

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:42.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact that a place was purchased

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:45.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where it was built 
(for that particular aspect of the work 

00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:49.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re in the right locations
and they have the right equipment),

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
it makes it a lot easier

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the brothers to be able to do their work.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:57.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
So being in these RTOs
is a blessing from Jehovah.

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new schools building

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:01.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to accommodate

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:03.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 250 students

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:06.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
each year.

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:10.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, a building dedicated for schools

00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:14.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
is well worth the effort and the investment

00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:16.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those that work on the project.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
This greatly strengthens my faith

00:08:19.102 --> 00:08:21.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when Jehovah desires something,

00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:25.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are no obstacles that can prevent
his purpose from happening.

00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:31.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve certainly seen
Jehovah’s blessing

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:33.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this arrangement.

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:36.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good planning, communication,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and collaboration

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:39.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
are allowing us

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:44.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prioritize and expedite work

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:46.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
that directly advances the global preaching

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:49.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teaching work.

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:52.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body would like to assure

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:55.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of you dear brothers and sisters

00:08:55.722 --> 00:09:00.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our deep love and appreciation for you.

00:09:01.061 --> 00:09:03.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank everyone

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:06.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all that you do to support us

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
in advancing Kingdom interests

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:14.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these exciting but challenging

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:18.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
final days of the last days.

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:22.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to providing facilities
to support the work,

00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:25.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
one size doesn’t fit all.

00:09:25.502 --> 00:09:29.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
By being adaptable and responsive
to the needs,

00:09:29.047 --> 00:09:32.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
the circumstances, the insight of others,

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:35.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the leadings of Jehovah’s spirit,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show that we are following
Jesus’ leadership

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:43.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are thus “made to grow
with the growth that is from God.”

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:46.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is preparing us

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
for even greater building
and educational projects

00:09:49.192 --> 00:09:52.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Paradise soon to come.
