00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:16.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 2:13,
the apostle Paul wrote:

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These things we also speak,

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not with words taught by human wisdom,

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but with those taught by the spirit,

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we explain spiritual matters
with spiritual words.”

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
Explaining “spiritual matters

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:32.344 line:10% position:50% align:center
with spiritual words”

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:34.763 line:10% position:50% align:center
is accomplished by combining

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
the power of God’s inspired Word

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the power of our publications

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are prepared
with the help of holy spirit.

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we allow the publications
of “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:48.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to explain God’s Word,

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
this has the most powerful, motivating effect
on our minds and hearts.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the main objective
here in the Theocratic Schools Department

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Patterson, New York.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, it may seem straightforward enough.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the very nature of divine education
is not static.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it’s dynamic

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our God is dynamic.

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s purpose advances,

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
so does our understanding.

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:21.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, everything taught
at our theocratic schools

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be kept up-to-date.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s no small task.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past nine years,

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:32.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
around 800,000 students have attended

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
just three schools in the field:

00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Congregation Elders,

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:41.288 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the School

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:43.415 line:10% position:50% align:center
for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.751 line:10% position:50% align:center
We want each student

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
in every school

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
to benefit
from our most current understanding.

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does the Schools Department

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep global curriculums current,

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
unified, and motivating?

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one of the important tools that we have

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
is our <i>Watch Tower Publications Index.</i>

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the index, there’s a section
entitled “Beliefs Clarified,”

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have had quite a few clarifications
in the last ten years.

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we follow that very, very closely.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re looking at
when there is a belief clarified,

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
how will that affect the outlines
we have in our schools

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what’s being taught?

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do we need to make a change?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we incorporate that into an outline?

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that way, the instructors

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
will always have the freshest
and the most up-to-date materials

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach the classes.

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we want to take special note

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Galatians chapter 2

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially verse 19.

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was not speaking about dying
as a condemned criminal

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:50.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the Mosaic Law
as we previously understood.

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, Paul was highlighting

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speaking 
about being liberated from the Law.

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are times
when a Scriptural point is changed,

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
a citation needs to be changed,

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:05.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a reference is no longer appropriate,

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:10.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so the outlines
have to be revised accordingly.

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a revision is made in one outline,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the other components in that unit

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:18.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
—such as the instructor’s outline,

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
the student’s outline, and the study guide—

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be checked, updated, and harmonized.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then that newly revised unit

00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
is sent around the world
to the branch offices

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:32.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be translated and implemented

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:35.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
into around 150 languages

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which these schools are taught.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:41.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s just for one lesson,
in one school.

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, units are often shared
across multiple schools.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when a change is made in one unit

00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, in Gilead—

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to make that change

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all the other school curriculums
where that unit appears.

00:03:55.714 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, all the schools
stay harmonious and unified.

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Gilead is our largest curriculum,

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
it takes diligent effort
to keep it fresh and motivating.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the things
that’s been used in Gilead for decades

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:15.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been the use of visual aids,

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and usually they were handmade models.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
An example of that is the tabernacle.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
This really helped students to understand
what the tabernacle looked like,

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:23.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
how it was made,

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it was put together and came apart.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
As technology has developed,

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:31.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
now we have 3D models

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a person’s tablet
or on the monitors in the classroom.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can actually take them

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:36.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the tabernacle.

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can turn the tabernacle.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can show it in different ways

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
—things that just weren’t possible
80 years ago when Gilead got its start.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way the Schools Department works

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep the Gilead curriculum
fresh and up-to-date

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by incorporating our latest publications

00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and video segments as soon as possible.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the Daniel drama
that was released

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:07.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the regional convention in 2021,

00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:10.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
we got the materials in September of 2021,

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:13.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were able to extract the portions

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we wanted to be used in Gilead
by December of 2021.

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:17.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it really only took four months

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get that all processed
and put into the curriculum.

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:24.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after seeing the dream
or what it may have looked like,

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can understand why Daniel wrote
that Nebuchadnezzar

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
was so agitated
that he couldn’t sleep.

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:32.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example of our efforts

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:35.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep our Gilead curriculum
fresh and up-to-date

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the release of the Bible study aid
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:43.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after its release

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2021,

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was soon put into the Gilead curriculum

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we began teaching it in our workshops.

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we would certainly like

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
to thank our two sisters
for that excellent demonstration.

00:05:56.043 --> 00:05:58.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did the teacher

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
use the “Explore” section of the book

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:03.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help reach the heart of her student?

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:06.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Gilead School

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:10.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pioneer school share similar lessons,

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:14.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
the adjustments needed to be made
to the pioneer school curriculum as well.

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:18.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pioneers are going to absolutely love
the updated curriculum

00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:20.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Pioneer Service School.

00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:22.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only have references been updated

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:25.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so the <i>Teach Us </i> and <i>God’s Love </i> book
references have been updated

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:27.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book—

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the workshops
are now redesigned to help pioneers

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:34.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
to start Bible studies
using the new publication,

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:38.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn how to use its features effectively,

00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:40.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even how to adapt each lesson

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their own Bible students.

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new pioneer school

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:46.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
will just build on their enthusiasm,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
their excitement to start Bible studies.

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any form of the ministry,
they’ll be looking to start Bible studies.

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that enthusiasm is contagious,

00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:58.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we know that it’ll actually have
a good effect on congregations worldwide.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only does
the Theocratic Schools Department

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
revise individual units in the curriculums

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at times entire schools.

00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:10.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:13.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
the curriculum for the School
for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:15.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
was completely revised.

00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:17.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And once approved
by the Teaching Committee,

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:20.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was sent to the branches worldwide

00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:21.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
for translation.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very excited
when the Teaching Committee

00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:27.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent us the letter about the School
for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.

00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:29.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was going to be an interactive school

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
with workshops, new outlines,
new videos, study guides.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you have someone
who loves Jehovah and the ministry

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you dig deep into the Scriptures,

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:43.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
it has a very powerful effect

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:44.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the person.

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:48.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it can even change your “spiritual DNA,”
as the saying goes.

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:50.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could see that it was going to be
a very powerful course.

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:56.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Combining spiritual matters
with spiritual words

00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout our global Theocratic Schools
takes tremendous work,

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:04.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah is clearly blessing
the efforts of everyone involved.

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:08.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s obvious that Jehovah
wants his people to be educated.

00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:12.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the amount of effort and resources

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the faithful slave have put

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:19.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
into educating God’s people
is second to none.

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
People come to school
—they attend a theocratic school—

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re built up.

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then they go,
and they affect the people around them.

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:31.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
These ones that go through these schools

00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:34.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
want to talk about the things they learned

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:37.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they felt and they experienced,

00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:39.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it has affected them.

00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:41.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re going to talk about it.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:44.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to hear it
at your midweek meeting.

00:08:44.294 --> 00:08:46.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to hear it
at the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study.

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll see a brother work in parts
in his public talks.

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:52.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out in the ministry, they’re sharing.

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:56.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know,
expression deepens impression.

00:08:57.432 --> 00:09:01.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so as they give,
it deepens the truth in them

00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:02.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
even more.

00:09:04.398 --> 00:09:07.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is making sure
that throughout the globe,

00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:10.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
spiritual matters are explained
with spiritual words

00:09:10.153 --> 00:09:12.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his inspired words,

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:13.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
his textbook.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:18.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may not have the circumstances
to attend a theocratic school

00:09:18.453 --> 00:09:21.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
beyond your midweek meeting,
but we all have access

00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the same textbook.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:27.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
So every time you make
an updated note in your textbook

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:28.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—God’s Word—

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:30.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s a clarified belief

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:32.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a point from our publications,

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:35.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are, in effect, in school with us.

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:38.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so thankful
that Jehovah has helped us

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:43.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep divine education in sync
with his unfolding purpose,

00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:46.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter who we are or where we live.

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
And be assured,

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:51.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
divine education is not winding down,

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s just beginning.
