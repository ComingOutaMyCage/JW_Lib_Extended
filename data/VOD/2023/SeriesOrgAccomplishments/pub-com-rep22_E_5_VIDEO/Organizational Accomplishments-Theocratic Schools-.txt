00:00:13 At 1 Corinthians 2:13, the apostle Paul wrote:
00:00:17 “These things we also speak,
00:00:19 “not with words taught by human wisdom,
00:00:22 “but with those taught by the spirit,
00:00:24 as we explain spiritual matters with spiritual words.”
00:00:29 Explaining “spiritual matters
00:00:31 with spiritual words”
00:00:32 is accomplished by combining
00:00:34 the power of God’s inspired Word
00:00:37 with the power of our publications
00:00:39 that are prepared with the help of holy spirit.
00:00:43 When we allow the publications of “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:00:46 to explain God’s Word,
00:00:48 this has the most powerful, motivating effect on our minds and hearts.
00:00:53 That is the main objective here in the Theocratic Schools Department
00:00:56 at Patterson, New York.
00:00:58 At first, it may seem straightforward enough.
00:01:01 However, the very nature of divine education is not static.
00:01:06 Rather, it’s dynamic
00:01:09 because our God is dynamic.
00:01:12 As Jehovah’s purpose advances,
00:01:14 so does our understanding.
00:01:17 As a result, everything taught at our theocratic schools
00:01:21 must be kept up-to-date.
00:01:23 And that’s no small task.
00:01:26 In the past nine years,
00:01:28 around 800,000 students have attended
00:01:32 just three schools in the field:
00:01:34 the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:01:37 the School for Congregation Elders,
00:01:40 and the School
00:01:41 for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.
00:01:44 We want each student
00:01:45 in every school
00:01:47 to benefit from our most current understanding.
00:01:51 How does the Schools Department
00:01:53 keep global curriculums current,
00:01:55 unified, and motivating?
00:02:01 So one of the important tools that we have
00:02:03 is our Watch Tower Publications Index.
00:02:06 In the index, there’s a section entitled “Beliefs Clarified,”
00:02:09 and we have had quite a few clarifications in the last ten years.
00:02:13 So we follow that very, very closely.
00:02:15 And we’re looking at when there is a belief clarified,
00:02:19 how will that affect the outlines we have in our schools
00:02:22 —what’s being taught?
00:02:24 And do we need to make a change?
00:02:26 How can we incorporate that into an outline?
00:02:28 And that way, the instructors
00:02:29 will always have the freshest and the most up-to-date materials
00:02:33 to teach the classes.
00:02:35 Now, we want to take special note
00:02:37 of Galatians chapter 2
00:02:40 and especially verse 19.
00:02:43 Paul was not speaking about dying as a condemned criminal
00:02:46 under the Mosaic Law as we previously understood.
00:02:50 Rather, Paul was highlighting
00:02:52 and speaking  about being liberated from the Law.
00:02:57 There are times when a Scriptural point is changed,
00:03:00 a citation needs to be changed,
00:03:02 or a reference is no longer appropriate,
00:03:06 and so the outlines have to be revised accordingly.
00:03:11 When a revision is made in one outline,
00:03:14 all the other components in that unit
00:03:16 —such as the instructor’s outline,
00:03:18 the student’s outline, and the study guide—
00:03:21 must be checked, updated, and harmonized.
00:03:25 Then that newly revised unit
00:03:27 is sent around the world to the branch offices
00:03:30 to be translated and implemented
00:03:32 into around 150 languages
00:03:35 in which these schools are taught.
00:03:37 And that’s just for one lesson, in one school.
00:03:41 However, units are often shared across multiple schools.
00:03:45 So when a change is made in one unit
00:03:48 —for example, in Gilead—
00:03:50 we have to make that change
00:03:52 in all the other school curriculums where that unit appears.
00:03:55 In this way, all the schools stay harmonious and unified.
00:04:03 Since Gilead is our largest curriculum,
00:04:05 it takes diligent effort to keep it fresh and motivating.
00:04:10 One of the things that’s been used in Gilead for decades
00:04:13 has been the use of visual aids,
00:04:15 and usually they were handmade models.
00:04:17 An example of that is the tabernacle.
00:04:19 This really helped students to understand what the tabernacle looked like,
00:04:22 how it was made,
00:04:23 and how it was put together and came apart.
00:04:26 As technology has developed,
00:04:28 now we have 3D models
00:04:31 on a person’s tablet or on the monitors in the classroom.
00:04:34 We can actually take them
00:04:35 to the tabernacle.
00:04:36 We can turn the tabernacle.
00:04:38 We can show it in different ways
00:04:40 —things that just weren’t possible
80 years ago when Gilead got its start.
00:04:46 Another way the Schools Department works
00:04:47 to keep the Gilead curriculum fresh and up-to-date
00:04:51 is by incorporating our latest publications
00:04:54 and video segments as soon as possible.
00:05:00 For example, the Daniel drama that was released
00:05:03 at the regional convention in 2021,
00:05:07 we got the materials in September of 2021,
00:05:10 and we were able to extract the portions
00:05:13 that we wanted to be used in Gilead by December of 2021.
00:05:16 So it really only took four months
00:05:17 to get that all processed and put into the curriculum.
00:05:21 Well, after seeing the dream or what it may have looked like,
00:05:24 you can understand why Daniel wrote that Nebuchadnezzar
00:05:28 was so agitated that he couldn’t sleep.
00:05:30 Another example of our efforts
00:05:32 to keep our Gilead curriculum fresh and up-to-date
00:05:36 was the release of the Bible study aid Enjoy Life Forever!
00:05:41 Shortly after its release
00:05:43 in 2021,
00:05:45 it was soon put into the Gilead curriculum
00:05:47 and we began teaching it in our workshops.
00:05:51 Well, we would certainly like
00:05:53 to thank our two sisters for that excellent demonstration.
00:05:56 So how did the teacher
00:05:58 use the “Explore” section of the book
00:06:01 to help reach the heart of her student?
00:06:04 Since Gilead School
00:06:06 and pioneer school share similar lessons,
00:06:10 the adjustments needed to be made to the pioneer school curriculum as well.
00:06:14 Pioneers are going to absolutely love the updated curriculum
00:06:18 for the Pioneer Service School.
00:06:20 Not only have references been updated
00:06:22 —so the Teach Us  and God’s Love  book references have been updated
00:06:25 to the Enjoy Life Forever!  book—
00:06:27 but the workshops are now redesigned to help pioneers
00:06:31 to start Bible studies using the new publication,
00:06:35 to learn how to use its features effectively,
00:06:38 and even how to adapt each lesson
00:06:40 to their own Bible students.
00:06:42 The new pioneer school
00:06:44 will just build on their enthusiasm,
00:06:46 their excitement to start Bible studies.
00:06:49 In any form of the ministry, they’ll be looking to start Bible studies.
00:06:51 And that enthusiasm is contagious,
00:06:54 so we know that it’ll actually have a good effect on congregations worldwide.
00:06:58 Not only does the Theocratic Schools Department
00:07:01 revise individual units in the curriculums
00:07:05 but at times entire schools.
00:07:07 During the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:07:10 the curriculum for the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives
00:07:13 was completely revised.
00:07:15 And once approved by the Teaching Committee,
00:07:17 it was sent to the branches worldwide
00:07:20 for translation.
00:07:21 We were very excited when the Teaching Committee
00:07:24 sent us the letter about the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.
00:07:27 It was going to be an interactive school
00:07:29 with workshops, new outlines, new videos, study guides.
00:07:34 When you have someone who loves Jehovah and the ministry
00:07:38 and you dig deep into the Scriptures,
00:07:41 it has a very powerful effect
00:07:43 on the person.
00:07:44 And it can even change your “spiritual DNA,” as the saying goes.
00:07:48 We could see that it was going to be a very powerful course.
00:07:53 Combining spiritual matters with spiritual words
00:07:56 throughout our global Theocratic Schools takes tremendous work,
00:08:00 but Jehovah is clearly blessing the efforts of everyone involved.
00:08:04 Well, it’s obvious that Jehovah wants his people to be educated.
00:08:08 And the amount of effort and resources
00:08:12 that the faithful slave have put
00:08:14 into educating God’s people is second to none.
00:08:19 People come to school —they attend a theocratic school—
00:08:22 and they’re built up.
00:08:24 But then they go, and they affect the people around them.
00:08:28 These ones that go through these schools
00:08:31 want to talk about the things they learned
00:08:34 and they felt and they experienced,
00:08:37 and how it has affected them.
00:08:39 And they’re going to talk about it.
00:08:41 You’re going to hear it at your midweek meeting.
00:08:44 You’re going to hear it at the Watchtower  Study.
00:08:46 You’ll see a brother work in parts in his public talks.
00:08:49 Out in the ministry, they’re sharing.
00:08:52 And you know, expression deepens impression.
00:08:57 And so as they give, it deepens the truth in them
00:09:01 even more.
00:09:04 Jehovah is making sure that throughout the globe,
00:09:07 spiritual matters are explained with spiritual words
00:09:10 —his inspired words,
00:09:12 his textbook.
00:09:13 You may not have the circumstances to attend a theocratic school
00:09:18 beyond your midweek meeting, but we all have access
00:09:21 to the same textbook.
00:09:23 So every time you make an updated note in your textbook
00:09:27 —God’s Word—
00:09:28 whether it’s a clarified belief
00:09:30 or a point from our publications,
00:09:32 you are, in effect, in school with us.
00:09:36 We are so thankful that Jehovah has helped us
00:09:38 to keep divine education in sync with his unfolding purpose,
00:09:43 no matter who we are or where we live.
00:09:46 And be assured,
00:09:48 divine education is not winding down,
00:09:51 it’s just beginning.
