00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:20.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have very low vision
in comparison to the average person.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is often very painful
to get through the day

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the extreme light sensitivity

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:27.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deterioration

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the health of my eye.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives me the knowledge

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I cannot expect this to go away.

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he never lets me forget
that we’re always in it together.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not see a disability in me,

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he sees someone

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is capable of bringing praise to him,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who is also capable

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
of helping others.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:58.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world in which we live,

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
people that are disadvantaged
feel like they’re not useful,

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here Jehovah has allowed

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who is unable to see

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to be equipped
to help other individuals,

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
using his Word.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like so many of us,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rachel, Wayne, and Thabo

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
appreciate the hard work

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
of “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide the spiritual food we all need.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Technologies used by those who are blind

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and visually impaired keep advancing.

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the direction of the Writing Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
our organization uses these advances

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make lifesaving spiritual food

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
more available in formats
the blind can use.

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this report,

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will briefly look at the history
of publications for the blind

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as new tools that are very helpful

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our blind brothers and sisters

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those they reach in the field.

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first,
let us consider what the difference is

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
between being visually impaired
and being blind.

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who are visually impaired
can see to a limited degree

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may be able to function
outside their home

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
without the use of a cane or a guide.

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:31.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who are visually impaired
may be able to read

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
by using a large-print publication

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
or by increasing the text size
of an electronic device.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, those who are blind

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not able to see well enough

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
to function outside their home

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
without the use of a cane or a guide.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may be totally blind,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they may be able
to detect only shadows

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
or very bright lights.

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:05.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
An estimated 43 million people worldwide

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:07.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
are blind.

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes more than 13,000

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many more of our brothers and sisters

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:18.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
are among the hundreds of millions

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are considered to be visually impaired.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is our history
of providing for their spiritual needs?

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:31.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Printing was first done

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a manually operated machine

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
that embossed one sheet at a time.

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over time, the equipment improved.

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made it easier to produce

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
complete <i>Watchtowers,</i>
books, booklets, and tracts.

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1988,

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
we produced the first edition

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures</i>

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
in English braille.

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I first started to pioneer,

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was no braille Bible.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be honest with you,

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was an unexpected gift

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to have it,

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:11.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read it at my disposal whenever I want to,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to be able
to uplift and encourage others.

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, our organization prints braille

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 48 languages.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:28.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition,
we are also helping those who are blind

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:31.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
but who cannot read or write braille.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few years ago,
we published the brochure 

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:37.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Learn to Read Braille.</i>

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has already been produced
in ten languages,

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more languages will be coming.

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:46.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent years,

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:49.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
new tools have given
blind and visually impaired readers

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
more options
for reading and studying the Bible.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in 2009, 

00:04:57.442 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  was produced
as an electronic braille file,

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and since 2014,

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:03.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been making these files

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:06.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
available on our website.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:09.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
These files can be downloaded
on a braille computer called a notetaker

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows the reader
the braille dots per line.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s say
if we want to take <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s 12 volumes to be able
to have the whole publication.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you have it on a little machine.

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very nice because you can take
your electronic device with you, then,

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:30.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever you need to go.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
A screen reader is a digital program

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can install
on an electronic device or computer.

00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can read aloud what is on the screen,

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:43.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping the user understand
and even navigate the page or site.

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:46.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
A feature that has received
a lot of positive feedback

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:50.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the use of alt text,
short for alternative text.

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:55.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are more extensive descriptions
of the pictures in our publications.

00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:57.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Page 16 image:

00:05:57.502 --> 00:05:59.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sister and her young daughter

00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
washing clothes by hand.

00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:03.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother and his wife bring them a meal.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first time
I encountered picture descriptions,

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was so nice.

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really felt part of the congregation.

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:14.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can confidently comment on the picture,

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the feedback that I’ve always gotten
from the brothers and sisters

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:21.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that the descriptions bring out the points

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they didn’t even realize
with their eyes.

00:06:26.448 --> 00:06:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
And hearing such comments from them
always gives me joy

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’m a source of encouragement to them.

00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:40.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Braille and screen readers
have been a spiritual lifeline

00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:43.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these brothers and sisters.

00:06:43.298 --> 00:06:45.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But today,

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
we receive
so much spiritual food through videos.

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:51.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s being done

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure
that the blind and visually impaired

00:06:54.643 --> 00:06:57.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
have access to videos as well?

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2020 at the regional convention,

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
we provided the first videos

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:06.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
with audio descriptions,

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:10.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are spoken phrases added to a video

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to explain what is seen on the screen.

00:07:13.036 --> 00:07:17.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us just put ourselves
in the shoes of a blind person

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:20.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see the difference
audio descriptions can make.

00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:34.683 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nighttime in the king’s bedroom,

00:07:34.683 --> 00:07:36.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
wind blows the curtains.

00:07:36.727 --> 00:07:38.729 line:10% position:50% align:center
He stirs in his sleep.

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.148 line:10% position:50% align:center
Flashes of himself crownless;

00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:46.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
an immense bright image;

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fireball crushes the feet.

00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:01.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like “the faithful and discreet slave”
was saying to me,

00:08:01.376 --> 00:08:03.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are going to give you one less thing

00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:07.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have to fight for
to understand and figure out on your own.”

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:11.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m getting the teaching point now.

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:15.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the person sitting next to you

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:19.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t have to describe
to you what’s going on.

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:21.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re independent again.

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:24.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love audio descriptions,

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:27.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nowadays it’s a bit difficult for me

00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
to watch a video
that does not have descriptions.

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:33.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also helps when it comes

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:35.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sharing with the other person

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lesson that I have learned
from that video.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:43.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves me,

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:46.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he compensates

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:49.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
for my absence of sight with something

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:52.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he knows I can truly benefit from.

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:57.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we are producing videos
with audio descriptions

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:01.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 92 languages.

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:04.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
These descriptions have proved very useful,

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:08.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they have had another unexpected benefit.

00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:10.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:13.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although originally prepared for the blind,

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discovered that brothers and sisters

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:17.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cannot afford to download

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
the video format of the convention program

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:23.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
are benefiting as well.

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
They listen to the audio descriptions,

00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:27.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and these descriptions

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:29.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
give them a clearer understanding

00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:31.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the scenes in our videos.

00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:37.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Psalm 23, David wrote:

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:40.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my Shepherd.

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will lack nothing.”

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like David, we all feel

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah, as a loving Shepherd,

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:49.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
guides and protects us.

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:53.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel that especially
when we can read the Bible

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and apply its lessons

00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:57.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
using spiritual food in print,

00:09:57.576 --> 00:10:00.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
audio, and video.

00:10:01.288 --> 00:10:03.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through his organization,

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah ensures that all of us,

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:09.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
including those who are
blind and visually impaired,

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:12.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
can confidently say:

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:15.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will lack nothing.”
