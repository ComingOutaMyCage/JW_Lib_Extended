00:00:16 I have very low vision in comparison to the average person.
00:00:21 It is often very painful to get through the day
00:00:23 because of the extreme light sensitivity
00:00:26 and the deterioration
00:00:27 of the health of my eye.
00:00:30 Jehovah gives me the knowledge
00:00:32 that I cannot expect this to go away.
00:00:35 But he never lets me forget that we’re always in it together.
00:00:42 Jehovah does not see a disability in me,
00:00:46 but he sees someone
00:00:48 who is capable of bringing praise to him,
00:00:50 someone who is also capable
00:00:52 of helping others.
00:00:56 In the world in which we live,
00:00:58 people that are disadvantaged feel like they’re not useful,
00:01:03 but here Jehovah has allowed
00:01:05 someone who is unable to see
00:01:08 to be able to be equipped to help other individuals,
00:01:12 using his Word.
00:01:16 Like so many of us,
00:01:18 Rachel, Wayne, and Thabo
00:01:21 appreciate the hard work
00:01:24 of “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:01:26 to provide the spiritual food we all need.
00:01:30 Technologies used by those who are blind
00:01:33 and visually impaired keep advancing.
00:01:37 Under the direction of the Writing Committee of the Governing Body,
00:01:41 our organization uses these advances
00:01:44 to make lifesaving spiritual food
00:01:47 more available in formats the blind can use.
00:01:52 In this report,
00:01:54 we will briefly look at the history of publications for the blind
00:01:57 as well as new tools that are very helpful
00:02:01 for our blind brothers and sisters
00:02:03 and those they reach in the field.
00:02:06 But first, let us consider what the difference is
00:02:10 between being visually impaired and being blind.
00:02:17 Those who are visually impaired can see to a limited degree
00:02:20 and may be able to function outside their home
00:02:24 without the use of a cane or a guide.
00:02:27 Those who are visually impaired may be able to read
00:02:31 by using a large-print publication
00:02:34 or by increasing the text size of an electronic device.
00:02:39 However, those who are blind
00:02:42 are not able to see well enough
00:02:45 to function outside their home
00:02:47 without the use of a cane or a guide.
00:02:51 They may be totally blind,
00:02:53 or they may be able to detect only shadows
00:02:56 or very bright lights.
00:03:01 An estimated 43 million people worldwide
00:03:05 are blind.
00:03:07 That includes more than 13,000
00:03:10 of our dear brothers and sisters.
00:03:14 Many more of our brothers and sisters
00:03:16 are among the hundreds of millions
00:03:18 who are considered to be visually impaired.
00:03:23 What is our history of providing for their spiritual needs?
00:03:30 Printing was first done
00:03:31 on a manually operated machine
00:03:33 that embossed one sheet at a time.
00:03:36 Over time, the equipment improved.
00:03:38 This made it easier to produce
00:03:40 complete Watchtowers, books, booklets, and tracts.
00:03:45 In 1988,
00:03:47 we produced the first edition
00:03:49 of the New World Translation  of the Holy Scriptures
00:03:52 in English braille.
00:03:55 When I first started to pioneer,
00:03:57 there was no braille Bible.
00:04:00 To be honest with you,
00:04:01 it was an unexpected gift
00:04:05 to be able to have it,
00:04:07 to read it at my disposal whenever I want to,
00:04:11 and also to be able to uplift and encourage others.
00:04:17 Today, our organization prints braille
00:04:20 in 48 languages.
00:04:25 In addition, we are also helping those who are blind
00:04:28 but who cannot read or write braille.
00:04:32 A few years ago, we published the brochure
00:04:35 Learn to Read Braille.
00:04:37 It has already been produced in ten languages,
00:04:40 and more languages will be coming.
00:04:44 In recent years,
00:04:46 new tools have given blind and visually impaired readers
00:04:49 more options for reading and studying the Bible.
00:04:55 Starting in 2009,
00:04:57 The Watchtower  was produced as an electronic braille file,
00:05:01 and since 2014,
00:05:02 we’ve been making these files
00:05:03 available on our website.
00:05:06 These files can be downloaded on a braille computer called a notetaker
00:05:09 that shows the reader the braille dots per line.
00:05:14 Well, let’s say if we want to take Enjoy Life Forever!,
00:05:17 it’s 12 volumes to be able to have the whole publication.
00:05:21 Now you have it on a little machine.
00:05:24 It’s very nice because you can take your electronic device with you, then,
00:05:28 wherever you need to go.
00:05:31 A screen reader is a digital program
00:05:33 you can install on an electronic device or computer.
00:05:37 It can read aloud what is on the screen,
00:05:39 helping the user understand and even navigate the page or site.
00:05:43 A feature that has received a lot of positive feedback
00:05:46 is the use of alt text, short for alternative text.
00:05:50 These are more extensive descriptions of the pictures in our publications.
00:05:55 Page 16 image:
00:05:57 a sister and her young daughter
00:05:59 washing clothes by hand.
00:06:00 A brother and his wife bring them a meal.
00:06:03 The first time I encountered picture descriptions,
00:06:05 it was so nice.
00:06:07 I really felt part of the congregation.
00:06:11 I can confidently comment on the picture,
00:06:14 and the feedback that I’ve always gotten from the brothers and sisters
00:06:18 is that the descriptions bring out the points
00:06:21 that they didn’t even realize with their eyes.
00:06:26 And hearing such comments from them always gives me joy
00:06:30 that I’m a source of encouragement to them.
00:06:36 Braille and screen readers have been a spiritual lifeline
00:06:40 for these brothers and sisters.
00:06:43 But today,
00:06:45 we receive so much spiritual food through videos.
00:06:49 So, what’s being done
00:06:51 to make sure that the blind and visually impaired
00:06:54 have access to videos as well?
00:06:59 In 2020 at the regional convention,
00:07:02 we provided the first videos
00:07:04 with audio descriptions,
00:07:06 which are spoken phrases added to a video
00:07:10 to explain what is seen on the screen.
00:07:13 Let us just put ourselves in the shoes of a blind person
00:07:17 to see the difference audio descriptions can make.
00:07:32 Nighttime in the king’s bedroom,
00:07:34 wind blows the curtains.
00:07:36 He stirs in his sleep.
00:07:38 Flashes of himself crownless;
00:07:44 an immense bright image;
00:07:50 a fireball crushes the feet.
00:07:57 I felt like “the faithful and discreet slave” was saying to me,
00:08:01 “We are going to give you one less thing
00:08:03 that you have to fight for to understand and figure out on your own.”
00:08:09 I’m getting the teaching point now.
00:08:13 Now the person sitting next to you
00:08:15 doesn’t have to describe to you what’s going on.
00:08:19 You’re independent again.
00:08:21 I love audio descriptions,
00:08:24 and nowadays it’s a bit difficult for me
00:08:27 to watch a video that does not have descriptions.
00:08:31 It also helps when it comes
00:08:33 to sharing with the other person
00:08:35 the lesson that I have learned from that video.
00:08:41 Jehovah loves me,
00:08:43 and he compensates
00:08:46 for my absence of sight with something
00:08:49 that he knows I can truly benefit from.
00:08:52 Today, we are producing videos with audio descriptions
00:08:57 in 92 languages.
00:09:01 These descriptions have proved very useful,
00:09:04 and they have had another unexpected benefit.
00:09:08 What is it?
00:09:10 Although originally prepared for the blind,
00:09:13 we discovered that brothers and sisters
00:09:15 who cannot afford to download
00:09:17 the video format of the convention program
00:09:21 are benefiting as well.
00:09:23 They listen to the audio descriptions,
00:09:25 and these descriptions
00:09:27 give them a clearer understanding
00:09:29 of the scenes in our videos.
00:09:34 In Psalm 23, David wrote:
00:09:37 “Jehovah is my Shepherd.
00:09:40 I will lack nothing.”
00:09:43 Like David, we all feel
00:09:45 that Jehovah, as a loving Shepherd,
00:09:47 guides and protects us.
00:09:49 We feel that especially when we can read the Bible
00:09:53 and apply its lessons
00:09:55 using spiritual food in print,
00:09:57 audio, and video.
00:10:01 Through his organization,
00:10:03 Jehovah ensures that all of us,
00:10:06 including those who are blind and visually impaired,
00:10:09 can confidently say:
00:10:12 “I will lack nothing.”
