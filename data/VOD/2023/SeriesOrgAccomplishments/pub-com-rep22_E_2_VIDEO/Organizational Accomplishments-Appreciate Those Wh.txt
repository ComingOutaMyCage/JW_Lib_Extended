00:00:14 The willing spirit of Jehovah’s people
00:00:16 has always made feelings of appreciation
00:00:18 well up in our heavenly Father’s heart.
00:00:22 For example, consider the attitude displayed by the nation of Israel
00:00:26 in supporting the construction of the tabernacle
00:00:29 in 1512 B.C.E.
00:00:32 As impressive as that structure was,
00:00:35 The Watchtower  of December 15, 2014, stated:
00:00:39 “What brought Jehovah the most pleasure
00:00:42 “was, not the material offerings,
00:00:44 but the willing spirit of those who thus supported pure worship.”
00:00:50 Exodus 36:2 describes how Bezalel, Oholiab,
00:00:54 and other skilled men took the lead in constructing the tabernacle.
00:00:58 But many others volunteered.
00:01:01 We are told that “everyone whose heart impelled him”
00:01:04 had a share.
00:01:06 All these people were a special source of joy to Jehovah.
00:01:14 Today, it is impressive to see what Jehovah’s organization
00:01:17 is accomplishing in all the earth.
00:01:20 And those who volunteer to do the work at Bethel
00:01:23 and in construction assignments
00:01:26 continue to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
00:01:29 The Personnel Committee has prepared the following report
00:01:32 to highlight some of the precious people who work behind the scenes
00:01:36 —our hardworking brothers and sisters in construction.
00:01:41 What is their work, lifestyle, and daily routine?
00:01:45 How can getting involved in this work as a young person
00:01:49 lead to rewarding opportunities in the future?
00:01:53 And how can all of us support these self-sacrificing servants of Jehovah?
00:01:59 We invite you to watch and listen
00:02:02 as some of our dear construction workers tell their stories.
00:02:10 There’s something special about construction.
00:02:13 Sometimes you travel to the middle of nowhere,
00:02:17 and we’ve met construction groups,
00:02:19 and there’s just a vibe, there’s just a “we’re family,”
00:02:23 and you’re going to have a good time.
00:02:26 So we kind of grew up around construction, which was a huge privilege.
00:02:30 Our parents were both involved in construction
00:02:32 on one particular Assembly Hall.
00:02:34 Yeah, we just heard from a few different characters,
00:02:37 and they just seemed to be having so much fun,
00:02:40 and the thought of having fun and to be in full-time service for Jehovah
00:02:44 was very, very appealing.
00:02:49 What I like the most about my assignment
00:02:52 is knowing that I can be a useful tool in Jehovah’s hands
00:02:56 and that wherever he sees a need, I can help.
00:03:01 My mom’s example later helped me to decide
00:03:05 to enter full-time service.
00:03:07 And when it came to doing more for Jehovah,
00:03:10 she taught us to make Jehovah’s service our way of life.
00:03:16 We really do have a lot of fun on the team,
00:03:19 and it’s a real mix of characters
00:03:23 —ages, experience.
00:03:25 And that’s really important because we’re doing a serious work at times.
00:03:29 But Jehovah is a happy God, and he wants us to enjoy our assignments.
00:03:35 I remember one particular convention
00:03:39 where I heard a talk about goals.
00:03:42 It kind of made me just take a pause and think about what my goals were.
00:03:46 What do I really want to do in my service to Jehovah?
00:03:49 Have I yet done anything that’s really shown him
00:03:52 that I’m putting my life squarely in his hands?
00:03:56 And I think that was that moment in that talk that I thought,
00:04:00 ‘It is time for an adventure with Jehovah.’
00:04:06 The routine of a construction servant
00:04:08 starts at Bethel with morning worship.
00:04:11 We love morning worship.
00:04:13 It’s almost like a mini convention.
00:04:15 You just get that little something
00:04:18 to keep you going through the day.
00:04:20 And then we’ve got a full day from 8 till 5
00:04:24 and enjoy lunch here on site
00:04:26 with the rest of the construction family and some of the Bethel family.
00:04:30 What’s really important for all of us on the project
00:04:33 is to maintain our own spirituality.
00:04:35 We have an environment where you can do good, quiet study.
00:04:40 In our assignments, it’s definitely been
00:04:42 that when we focused on the ministry on the weekends,
00:04:45 what happens in the week was always better.
00:04:51 Something else I enjoy about being here in my routine
00:04:55 is spending time with my friends.
00:05:00 We don’t just work, but Jehovah lets us have fun.
00:05:11 So I have no construction background at all.
00:05:15 So everything that I’ve been able to enjoy with the project
00:05:18 has been because brothers have shown some confidence
00:05:21 and given me the opportunity to learn.
00:05:25 There’s a huge variety of roles within a construction project of this size.
00:05:30 Obviously, there are needs for the real skills of trades
00:05:33 that are needed to actually build the buildings,
00:05:35 but there’s a vast support network
00:05:38 that can often be office-based.
00:05:42 We’re from quite simple backgrounds.
00:05:45 We had simple jobs.
00:05:47 And what Jehovah
00:05:49 has managed to achieve with us
00:05:52 always amazes us, really,
00:05:54 because we now do jobs that we never would have imagined
00:05:58 that we could have done.
00:06:03 So every assignment that we’ve had
00:06:05 I think we’ve felt quite overwhelmed, . . .
00:06:07 Overwhelmed.
00:06:08 . . . inexperienced.
00:06:11 I think sometimes when you’re completely out of your comfort zone
00:06:15 is when Jehovah can give you what you most need.
00:06:19 So the end outcome is always an enormous blessing.
00:06:22 And so the blessings always outweigh the challenges.
00:06:28 Something else that’s really helped us through challenges
00:06:31 is the brothers and sisters we’ve worked with.
00:06:33 They’re always there for us, always with a comforting word,
00:06:38 a hug, an arm around the shoulder,
00:06:41 and often that’s really helped us get through challenging situations as well.
00:06:47 I think the greatest challenge I’ve faced,
00:06:51 and continue to face,
00:06:53 is a fear of the unknown.
00:06:56 The fear of filling out an application and sending it,
00:07:00 of an assignment that I don’t know how to carry out or if I’m capable of,
00:07:03 and of going somewhere else and not knowing how to get there.
00:07:07 Despite the challenges I have faced in Jehovah’s service,
00:07:10 I have always received help.
00:07:14 And on one occasion, when I was traveling to my new assignment,
00:07:17 I had logistical issues that arose because of the pandemic.
00:07:22 In my case, the branch was always there
00:07:25 to support me in everything
00:07:28 with all the decisions I had to make
00:07:30 and the documents I had to get for the trip.
00:07:34 One of the Bible accounts that’s always meant a lot to me is David and Jonathan
00:07:38 and the fact that they really didn’t know each other that long
00:07:42 but had such an incredible friendship and bond.
00:07:45 And I really feel the congregation has been that for me out here.
00:07:50 And ones that you meet,
00:07:53 just within a very short period of time, you think:
00:07:56 ‘They’re going to be like family. They’re—
00:07:58 I’m going to know them forever.’
00:08:02 On a project, you could be far away
00:08:04 from those that really do know all those years before
00:08:07 or your family.
00:08:09 So you’re so reliant on that support.
00:08:17 So there is no work we do or assignment we might have
00:08:21 that isn’t really just giving back to Jehovah
00:08:24 a little bit of what he has given us.
00:08:27 Looking back, the only thing that I regret
00:08:30 is not putting my application in even sooner.
00:08:33 But there’s nothing that I regret about having put it in
00:08:36 and the life that Jehovah has allowed me to enjoy since then.
00:08:41 Working with a team of brothers and sisters, what a massive privilege!
00:08:44 You’re not in the world. You’re not in Satan’s system.
00:08:47 You’re just surrounded by characters
00:08:51 who have the same goal.
00:08:54 It’s not easy living in this system, but I think when we’re in full-time service,
00:08:59 when we’re giving of ourselves to Jehovah in that way,
00:09:02 he just gives back so much more.
00:09:07 It just becomes a great way to live your life.
00:09:09 You’re serving Jehovah, you’re with a great group of people,
00:09:12 and you’re having a great time.
00:09:15 And who wouldn’t want a piece of that?
00:09:18 We love our dear brothers and sisters
00:09:20 who have willingly extended themselves in theocratic service.
00:09:24 And we know that you do too.
00:09:29 We thank all of you for the spirit you show in helping maintain
00:09:32 your local places of pure worship.
00:09:36 We commend all of you who, like David, Jasmine,
00:09:39 Jonathan, and Carolina,
00:09:42 made the decision as a youth to volunteer for Jehovah’s service.
00:09:47 We are confident the young ones will set similar goals
00:09:51 and experience the unique joy that working with Jehovah brings.
00:09:57 We also want to thank the thousands of special full-time servants and volunteers
00:10:02 who work behind the scenes
00:10:04 on construction projects around the world.
00:10:07 Your work is appreciated
00:10:09 and worthy of much commendation.
00:10:14 Your tireless efforts to construct, remodel,
00:10:18 and maintain places of pure worship
00:10:20 benefit all of us.
00:10:22 Your work contributes to the advancement of Kingdom interests.
00:10:27 And above all, it warms the heart
00:10:30 of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
