00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.161 line:10% position:50% align:center
The willing spirit of Jehovah’s people

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.831 line:10% position:50% align:center
has always made feelings of appreciation

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.293 line:10% position:50% align:center
well up in our heavenly Father’s heart.

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:26.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, consider the attitude
displayed by the nation of Israel

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
in supporting the construction
of the tabernacle

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1512 B.C.E.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
As impressive as that structure was,

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> of December 15, 2014, stated:

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What brought Jehovah the most pleasure

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was, not the material offerings,

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:49.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the willing spirit
of those who thus supported pure worship.”

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exodus 36:2 describes how Bezalel, Oholiab,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other skilled men
took the lead in constructing the tabernacle.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
But many others volunteered.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are told
that “everyone whose heart impelled him”

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a share.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these people were
a special source of joy to Jehovah.

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, it is impressive to see
what Jehovah’s organization

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
is accomplishing in all the earth.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those who volunteer
to do the work at Bethel

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:26.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in construction assignments

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Personnel Committee
has prepared the following report

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
to highlight some of the precious people
who work behind the scenes

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our hardworking brothers and sisters
in construction.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is their work, lifestyle,
and daily routine?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can getting involved in this work
as a young person

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
lead to rewarding opportunities
in the future?

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can all of us support
these self-sacrificing servants of Jehovah?

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to watch and listen

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:06.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
as some of our dear construction workers
tell their stories.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something special about construction.

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:17.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you travel
to the middle of nowhere,

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve met construction groups,

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:23.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s just a vibe,
there’s just a “we’re family,”

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re going to have a good time.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we kind of grew up around construction,
which was a huge privilege.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our parents were both involved
in construction

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
on one particular Assembly Hall.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we just heard
from a few different characters,

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they just seemed to be having
so much fun,

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the thought of having fun
and to be in full-time service for Jehovah

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:47.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very, very appealing.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:52.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I like the most about my assignment

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
is knowing that I can be
a useful tool in Jehovah’s hands

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:59.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that wherever he sees a need, I can help.

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:05.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom’s example later helped me to decide

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enter full-time service.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when it came to doing more for Jehovah,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
she taught us to make Jehovah’s service
our way of life.

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:19.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really do have a lot of fun on the team,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s a real mix of characters

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
—ages, experience.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s really important
because we’re doing a serious work at times.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is a happy God,
and he wants us to enjoy our assignments.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one particular convention

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I heard a talk about goals.

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
It kind of made me just take a pause
and think about what my goals were.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:49.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do I really want to do
in my service to Jehovah?

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have I yet done anything
that’s really shown him

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:56.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’m putting my life
squarely in his hands?

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think that was that moment in that talk
that I thought,

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:02.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It is time for an adventure with Jehovah.’

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:08.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
The routine of a construction servant

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:11.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
starts at Bethel with morning worship.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love morning worship.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:15.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s almost like a mini convention.

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just get that little something

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep you going through the day.

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:24.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we’ve got a full day from 8 till 5

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy lunch here on site

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the rest of the construction family
and some of the Bethel family.

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:33.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s really important
for all of us on the project

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to maintain our own spirituality.

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have an environment
where you can do good, quiet study.

00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our assignments, it’s definitely been

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when we focused on the ministry
on the weekends,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happens in the week was always better.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else I enjoy
about being here in my routine

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:57.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
is spending time with my friends.

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t just work,
but Jehovah lets us have fun.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I have no construction background at all.

00:05:15.544 --> 00:05:18.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
So everything that I’ve been able to enjoy
with the project

00:05:18.797 --> 00:05:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been because brothers
have shown some confidence

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:24.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and given me the opportunity to learn.

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:30.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a huge variety of roles
within a construction project of this size.

00:05:30.058 --> 00:05:33.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, there are needs
for the real skills of trades

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:35.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are needed
to actually build the buildings,

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:38.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there’s a vast support network

00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:40.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can often be office-based.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:45.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re from quite simple backgrounds.

00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:47.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had simple jobs.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:49.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what Jehovah

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:52.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
has managed to achieve with us

00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
always amazes us, really,

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:58.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we now do jobs
that we never would have imagined

00:05:58.295 --> 00:05:59.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could have done.

00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So every assignment that we’ve had

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we’ve felt quite overwhelmed, . . .

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:08.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Overwhelmed.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . inexperienced.

00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:15.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think sometimes when you’re completely
out of your comfort zone

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when Jehovah can give you
what you most need.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the end outcome is always
an enormous blessing.

00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:27.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the blessings always outweigh
the challenges.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else that’s really helped us
through challenges

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:33.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the brothers and sisters
we’ve worked with.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:38.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re always there for us,
always with a comforting word,

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:41.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
a hug, an arm around the shoulder,

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and often that’s really helped us
get through challenging situations as well.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think the greatest challenge I’ve faced,

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:53.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to face,

00:06:53.308 --> 00:06:56.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a fear of the unknown.

00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:00.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fear of filling out an application
and sending it,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an assignment that I don’t know
how to carry out or if I’m capable of,

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:06.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of going somewhere else
and not knowing how to get there.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:10.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the challenges I have faced
in Jehovah’s service,

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:12.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have always received help.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on one occasion,
when I was traveling to my new assignment,

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:22.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had logistical issues
that arose because of the pandemic.

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:25.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my case, the branch was always there

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:28.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support me in everything

00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all the decisions I had to make

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:32.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the documents I had to get for the trip.

00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:37.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the Bible accounts that’s always meant
a lot to me is David and Jonathan

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:42.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that they really didn’t know
each other that long

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:45.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had such an incredible friendship
and bond.

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:50.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I really feel the congregation
has been that for me out here.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ones that you meet,

00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:56.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
just within a very short period of time,
you think:

00:07:56.913 --> 00:07:58.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They’re going to be like family. They’re—

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:01.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to know them forever.’

00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:04.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a project, you could be far away

00:08:04.588 --> 00:08:07.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
from those that really do know
all those years before

00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:09.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
or your family.

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:13.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re so reliant on that support.

00:08:17.642 --> 00:08:21.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there is no work we do
or assignment we might have

00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:24.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
that isn’t really just giving back to Jehovah

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little bit of what he has given us.

00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:30.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, the only thing that I regret

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not putting my application in even sooner.

00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:36.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s nothing that I regret
about having put it in

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:40.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the life that Jehovah
has allowed me to enjoy since then.

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:44.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Working with a team of brothers and sisters,
what a massive privilege!

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:47.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not in the world.
You’re not in Satan’s system.

00:08:47.547 --> 00:08:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just surrounded by characters

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:53.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have the same goal.

00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:59.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not easy living in this system,
but I think when we’re in full-time service,

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:02.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re giving of ourselves to Jehovah
in that way,

00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:05.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
he just gives back so much more.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:09.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just becomes
a great way to live your life.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re serving Jehovah,
you’re with a great group of people,

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re having a great time.

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:18.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who wouldn’t want a piece of that?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love our dear brothers and sisters

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:24.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have willingly extended themselves
in theocratic service.

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:29.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that you do too.

00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:32.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank all of you for the spirit you show
in helping maintain

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:36.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
your local places of pure worship.

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:39.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
We commend all of you
who, like David, Jasmine,

00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonathan, and Carolina,

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
made the decision as a youth
to volunteer for Jehovah’s service.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are confident the young ones
will set similar goals

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:55.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experience the unique joy
that working with Jehovah brings.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also want to thank the thousands
of special full-time servants and volunteers

00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:04.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
who work behind the scenes

00:10:04.082 --> 00:10:07.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
on construction projects around the world.

00:10:07.294 --> 00:10:09.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your work is appreciated

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worthy of much commendation.

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:18.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your tireless efforts to construct, remodel,

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:20.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain places of pure worship

00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:22.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit all of us.

00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:27.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your work contributes
to the advancement of Kingdom interests.

00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:30.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And above all, it warms the heart

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:33.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
