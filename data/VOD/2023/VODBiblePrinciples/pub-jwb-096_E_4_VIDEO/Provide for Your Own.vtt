00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caring for the needs of my family

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a source of great joy.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:35.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the life that was.

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:39.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
One drunk driver

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my wife was gone.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:48.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our two children
had lost their loving mother.

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:55.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctors were hopeful that my son

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:58.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
might regain the use of his legs,

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in the meantime,

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:04.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed to adjust to this new situation.

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:08.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum was such a support,

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:13.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
both emotionally and practically.

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:17.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
She helped with the children

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
while I went to work.

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:24.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way I was able
to care for the family’s physical needs.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know
what I would have done without her.

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:47.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
My fellow elders
were loving and considerate too.

00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:50.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
They offered to lighten
some of my congregation responsibilities,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I just wanted to keep busy.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:59.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to keep on top of everything,

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
but spiritually things began to slip.

00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:05.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
On more than one occasion,

00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:09.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to ask others
to cover my meeting parts.

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:11.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Simon.

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hi, Oliver.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been held up at work again.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you cover
the Treasures part for me tonight?

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, no problem.

00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll see what I can do.

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:22.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:29.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just too tired
to prepare for family worship,

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:36.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the results were obvious.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything seemed overwhelming.

00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:57.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even the simple things

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
were a struggle.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
The meeting was great.

00:03:06.397 --> 00:03:10.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Dad,
you missed Madison’s demonstration tonight.

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry!

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:23.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to work late.

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry, Dad.

00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something had to give.

00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:34.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I needed to step aside as an elder.

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:36.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed help.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I reached out to a good friend, Simon.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
I explained everything.

00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:46.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
He really listened.

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
He empathized
and commended me for my efforts

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:53.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then shared Philippians 1:10 with me.

00:03:53.784 --> 00:03:56.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . that you may make sure
of the more important things.”

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:02.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oliver,
it’s especially during challenging times

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to ‘make sure
of the important things,’

00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:09.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the key to doing that is balance.

00:04:10.594 --> 00:04:12.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come over here.

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:16.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simon used a simple illustration

00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:19.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that changed my perspective.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as a wheel can be out of balance,

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:27.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sudden change in our circumstances
can put us out of balance.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
But skilled mechanics

00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:34.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
can use small weights to rebalance the wheel.

00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:36.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
The machine told Simon

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
where to position the small weight
so that the wheel could run smoothly again.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got the point.

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:47.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regaining balance
might not involve big changes

00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:49.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just a few smaller ones.

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:50.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:59.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Balance comes when we exercise faith.

00:05:02.194 --> 00:05:04.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:6 reminded me that Jehovah

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:08.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the rewarder
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:11.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
And James 3:17 says

00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:14.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the wisdom from above is . . . reasonable.”

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:20.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that my family’s spiritual needs
are one “of the more important things.”

00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s OK to ask others for support.

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:37.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Applying these Bible principles
helped me regain my joy.

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:41.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our circumstances may change,

00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:45.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our Christian priorities do not.

00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:49.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
They keep us anchored to our living hope.

00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:53.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum—
And we’ll be all together.

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:55.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to Jehovah,

00:05:55.337 --> 00:05:58.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to provide for my own

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:01.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the most important ways.
