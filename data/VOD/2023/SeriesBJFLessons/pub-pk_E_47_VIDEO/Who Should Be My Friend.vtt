00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:10.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got this!
Come on!

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:12.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go, go, go!

00:00:12.437 --> 00:00:13.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:15.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bro, that was good!

00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:40.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurry up, we’re gonna be late!

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, let’s go!

00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:44.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Woo!

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:55.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he called them his friends.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see throughout the Gospel accounts
that those

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:04.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
who chose to befriend Jesus
gained the best friend possible.

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:11.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey there!

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you like to draw?

00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:17.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like your notes.

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:19.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really cool.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom taught me.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pictures help me remember.

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:25.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:29.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it looks like we have a talk together.

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:30.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:32.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll be in touch to practice soon.

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lydia, we’re leaving.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I gotta go.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, Sophia.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, bro.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, good to see you.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad I was on your team.

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:53.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
My favorite thing was the safari tree house.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah! It had all
the cool jungle animals on the wall.

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:59.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Timmy, I didn’t think your team
was gonna make it.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love my prize.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got a prize?

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all did.

00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:22.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Umm.
Hehe.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, kids, settle down.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s time to get started.

00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:33.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a lot to talk about today.

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we begin,

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:45.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those of you that participated
in the Science Club this weekend,

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:47.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be having another camping trip.

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:51.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
But only the ones
with the highest score on the math project

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:54.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be selected to go.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
More on that after class.

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:57.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Sophia.

00:02:57.812 --> 00:02:59.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need you in our club.

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:01.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re good at science.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have another trip coming up.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:13.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Sophia!

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:15.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come with us.

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
So anyway, all the kids had badges
and prizes and stuff,

00:03:26.354 --> 00:03:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it sounded like a lot of fun.

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:33.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it seems like they really need my help.

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:38.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.
I see.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you see what’s wrong with the car?

00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:42.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I wish.

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I see why you want to be in the club.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
You do?

00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:48.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:03:48.354 --> 00:03:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all want to have friends
and do fun things.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, would you mind moving
the light over here?

00:03:54.687 --> 00:03:56.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, right there, thank you.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just wish I had some kid friends.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:10.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you and me to have friends.

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:15.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question you need to ask yourself is,
‘Who should be my friend?’

00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:19.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about it
at our next family worship.

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:24.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about you go do some research on Martha.

00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:29.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will tell Caleb too.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we can come back together
and talk about it as a family.

00:04:38.354 --> 00:04:40.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia, are you ready?

00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:40.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Martha.

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:49.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Jewess, the sister of Lazarus and Mary.”

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:53.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lived in Bethany,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a village ‘about two miles’ away
from Jerusalem,”

00:04:58.437 --> 00:05:02.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was probably Jesus’ home base
when he came down from Galilee.

00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha liked to cook.

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, she did.

00:05:08.687 --> 00:05:11.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she would cook for Jesus

00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:13.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all his disciples when they would visit.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would have been a lot of food.

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:20.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and a lot of work.

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if they work together,
they’d make it a success.

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, some of their friends

00:05:29.104 --> 00:05:30.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt differently about Jesus.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha makes the best apricot cakes.

00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:43.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just a fact.

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve always praised me too much, Talia.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if it gets me more apricot cakes,
I will continue to praise you.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh Talia, did you hear?

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Teacher, Jesus,
he’s coming back to visit.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man from Galilee?

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:05.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you— Are you hosting him again?

00:06:06.062 --> 00:06:08.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I am.

00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, it’s tonight.

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve heard a lot of talk.

00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:17.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pharisees in Jerusalem,
they don’t approve of that man.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am not sure it’s such a good idea
for you to be known as his friend.

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:28.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, well, I guess I better be getting home.

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you two later.

00:06:51.854 --> 00:06:54.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha!
Jesus is here.

00:07:47.312 --> 00:07:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me get this straight.

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:52.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted you and Mary

00:07:52.062 --> 00:07:55.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sit and learn about God just like the men?

00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
A teacher instructing women?

00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:02.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman’s job
is to provide food for her household.

00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:03.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true!

00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:07.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good woman
“prepares herself for hard work.”

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s valuable.

00:08:08.937 --> 00:08:10.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s you, Martha.

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:14.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let this Jesus ruin you with his ideas.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lazarus!

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
So kind of you.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is he doing?

00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:44.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not well.

00:08:44.687 --> 00:08:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sent word to Jesus.

00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:48.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help my brother.

00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:50.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
You sent word to Jesus?

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:52.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you still not heard?

00:08:52.854 --> 00:08:56.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s angering people
with his shocking speech.

00:08:56.729 --> 00:08:58.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s claiming to be God’s Son.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s crazy!

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:04.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s loyal to Jehovah, and he is our friend.

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:15.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Lazarus died.

00:09:19.604 --> 00:09:22.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you remember what happened next?

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus came back to Bethany
and resurrected Lazarus.

00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:30.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was a real friend.

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:33.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
He cared about Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:38.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he showed them
what kind of Friend Jehovah can be to us.

00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:42.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not where this story ends.

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:45.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know what some people did after that?

00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:48.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many of the Jews . . .
who saw what he did put faith in him, 

00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:52.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but some of them went off to the Pharisees

00:09:52.354 --> 00:09:55.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told them what Jesus had done.”

00:09:55.312 --> 00:09:57.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did they do that?

00:09:57.312 --> 00:10:01.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because not even seeing Jesus
bring someone back to life

00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
was enough to convince them
that he was the Christ.

00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seemed like Martha’s friends,

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:12.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they hated Jesus.

00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:16.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you think Martha dealt
with her unbelieving friends?

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:24.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is the Christ,
“the resurrection and the life.”

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:27.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the Son of God.

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:30.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he is my friend.

00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:36.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talia, you’ve been kind to me in the past.

00:10:36.895 --> 00:10:40.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you don’t believe Jesus’ teachings.

00:10:40.145 --> 00:10:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot be friends.

00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:55.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha stuck with Jesus and his friends.

00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:59.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped her become Jehovah’s friend.

00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:14.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Sophia,

00:11:14.062 --> 00:11:17.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you think Jehovah is teaching you
about friendship?

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:22.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I have to choose my friends carefully.

00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:25.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can you know
if someone should be your friend?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they help me be Jehovah’s friend.

I’m not going to join the club.

That’s my girl.

00:11:37.104 --> 00:11:40.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so proud of you, Sophia.

And Jehovah is proud of you too.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, 
how about you go finish up your homework?

00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:48.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom tells me we have a guest coming over.

00:11:49.687 --> 00:11:50.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:11:58.812 --> 00:12:02.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, please help me find a good friend,

00:12:02.437 --> 00:12:04.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who loves you.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least you’re my friend.

00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:15.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia!

00:12:15.854 --> 00:12:17.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lydia is here.

00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:19.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our talk!

00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:29.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you like turtles?

00:12:29.104 --> 00:12:30.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love turtles!

00:12:31.562 --> 00:12:32.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:38.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got something I want to show you.

00:12:42.437 --> 00:12:45.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is so cute.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Sophia,
I think we’re going to be friends.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yup, definitely friends.
