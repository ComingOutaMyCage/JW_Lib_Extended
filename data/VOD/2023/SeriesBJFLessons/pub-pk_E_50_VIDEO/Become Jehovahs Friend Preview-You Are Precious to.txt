00:00:08 What ya doing?
00:00:09 Um, I’m just about to meet . . .
00:00:11 . . . Sophia.
00:00:13 Why do you hang out with her?
00:00:17 Does it bother you that others think you’re different?
00:00:21 What do you mean?
00:00:23 I don’t know.
00:00:24 I-I gotta go.
00:00:29 You should hang out with us
00:00:31 —not that loser.
00:00:33 People aren’t always nice
00:00:34 to others they think are different.
00:00:37 Hey, Zoe,
00:00:39 aren’t you coming?
