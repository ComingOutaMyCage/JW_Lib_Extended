00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:13.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . Sophia.

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:15.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you hang out with her?

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:21.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it bother you
that others think you’re different?

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
I-I gotta go.

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:31.211 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:33.504 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:34.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
People aren’t always nice

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
to others they think are different.

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:39.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Zoe,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
