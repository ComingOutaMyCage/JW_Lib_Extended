Hey, Dad!
Here’s my service report.

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good!

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:15.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can put it on the bench.

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:16.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:24.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, when can I be a publisher?

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:27.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, you have brought this up before.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re together in the ministry,
you do very well when speaking at the door.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, I can?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not just yet.

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:40.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like getting a license to drive a car.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to be approved.

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can discuss how the elders
are involved in approving you.

00:00:54.383 --> 00:00:57.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
For now, let’s see if you might qualify.

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:01.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, do you obey Jehovah and your parents?

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next,

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:08.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you believe the Bible is Jehovah’s Word,

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:10.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can you explain the basic teachings?

00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:14.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And are your friends Jehovah’s friends?

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:17.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caleb, you’re already doing very well.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
One last thing:

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:27.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to be
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and preach?

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:29.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do!

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:31.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I’m ready!

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:33.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think you are too.

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’ll have to see what the elders decide.

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:38.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so proud of you, son.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:40.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, could you hand me that wrench?

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:41.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:42.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.
