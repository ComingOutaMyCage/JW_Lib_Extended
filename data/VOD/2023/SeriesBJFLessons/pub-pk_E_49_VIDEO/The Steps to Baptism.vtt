Wow!

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:09.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
That looks like me.

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:13.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a question.

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:15.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it, my dear?

00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:18.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you get baptized?

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good question . . .

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and an important one.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom looks so young in this picture!

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:27.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:31.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you can be young like your mother.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:34.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
What matters is that you love Jehovah

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and want to follow Jesus’ teachings closely.

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:44.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can show that you want to get baptized
by what you do,

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
like obeying your parents.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Learn about Jehovah by reading the Bible.

00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:54.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will help you obey Jehovah

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid things that Jehovah hates.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you’ll want to share your faith
with others . . .

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . especially in the ministry.

00:01:04.854 --> 00:01:06.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the meetings,

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:12.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
make friends with others who love Jehovah.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, most important, tell Jehovah in prayer

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you want to serve him forever.

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:22.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we get baptized in public.

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:25.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows others
that we’ve dedicated our lives to Jehovah.

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s so cool.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to get baptized one day?

00:01:30.104 --> 00:01:31.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm!

00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you learn a little more
about the steps for baptism

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:38.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and share it with us at family worship?

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK!
