00:00:02 When was the last time you lost your patience?
00:00:06 on the road?
00:00:08 at work?
00:00:10 or at home?
00:00:13 Our busy lives
00:00:15 make it difficult for us to be patient.
00:00:18 But to enjoy life,
00:00:20 we need patience more than ever
00:00:22 —even if it’s being tested.
00:00:25 But what does patience really mean?
00:00:29 Does it mean we just passively wait
00:00:32 for something to change?
00:00:34 And how can patience affect our daily life?
00:00:40 The 2023 “Exercise Patience”!
00:00:43 Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:45 will show you what true patience is,
00:00:48 why we need it,
00:00:52 and how it can improve our relationships with others.
00:00:59 God wants you to be happy.
00:01:02 And as our Creator,
00:01:03 he knows that exercising patience is vital.
