When was the last time
you lost your patience?

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:08.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the road?

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:10.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
at work?

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at home?

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our busy lives

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
make it difficult for us to be patient.

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to enjoy life,

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need patience more than ever

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even if it’s being tested.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does patience really mean?

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it mean we just passively wait

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
for something to change?

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can patience affect our daily life?

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we need it,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it can improve
our relationships with others.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
God wants you to be happy.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:03.834 line:90% position:50% align:center

he knows that exercising patience is vital.
