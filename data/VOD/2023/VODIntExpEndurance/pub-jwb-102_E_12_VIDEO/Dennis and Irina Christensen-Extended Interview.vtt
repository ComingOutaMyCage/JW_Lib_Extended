00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were at a meeting
of our congregation in the city of Oryol.

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then one of our ministerial servants
came running to me and said,

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dennis, you have to go in the hallway.”

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“OK, OK.”

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
I then went in the corridor,
and there were people standing there in masks

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a lot of police officers
and a lot of FSB people.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed their IDs and said
that they were going to search our hall.

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
I certainly didn’t know
exactly what to do in that situation.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, this is the first time for me.

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know one thing:

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I am an elder in this congregation

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the shepherd of my brothers and sisters

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I must keep them safe
and try to keep them calm.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:01.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I was sure that the situation
would be resolved sooner or later.

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
They behaved very rudely at first.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then after a few minutes,

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:11.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
they completely calmed down,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
sat there in the front row,
and looked at me with very strange faces,

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if they said:
“Look, what are we even doing here?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Here are grandmothers, women, and children.

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s all peaceful and quiet.”

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:33.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sure everything was legal on our part

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they told me,
“So Dennis, we’ll take you in for two days.”

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought: ‘Well, it’s no big deal,
and it’s going to be resolved.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Two days is something I can live with.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other brothers and sisters were in prison
before me, and I can do it too.’

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was sure, too,
that Jehovah was protecting me.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it was 11 o’clock in the evening.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took me to the cell.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
I arrived in my suit.

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a jacket, a tie, and a shirt.

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:12.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you might say that the other prisoners

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
looked at me like I was from the moon.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know what lay ahead of me.

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:21.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also had no experience of being in prison,

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I decided,
‘OK, I need to take the first step.’

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I came to the other prisoners and said,
 “Hello, my name is Dennis.”

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hardest part
was being separated from my wife, Irina.

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really worried about her health:

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does she have what she needs materially?

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Are they hounding her as well?

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will she end up next to me in prison?’

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of thoughts were on my mind,

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:58.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why the first two months
were the hardest for me.

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
The detention center is located

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can’t
generally see the prisoners, right?

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to find a place
where I could see his window.

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:16.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just from his window,
he could see me well.

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:19.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we agreed that I would go there.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dennis told me what time.

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:27.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was my favorite time,
you might say, of the whole day.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:29.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was looking forward to 1:00 p.m.,

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
my opportunity to see Irina.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was only five to ten minutes.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
For two years we had this routine.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irina came every day!

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the snow,

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the rain, in bright sunshine

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no matter what the weather was,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day she was there.

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was our little secret that we reveal now.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:02.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
For two years,
we didn’t tell it to anyone at all.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used to write me really funny letters

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:10.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and draw some funny drawings

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make me laugh a little bit
and cheer me up,

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:16.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we are that sort of family.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:18.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re always laughing and making jokes.

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really tried my best to be a good husband.

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:26.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was in the detention center,

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:29.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to call her twice a month.

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to write her letters

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
five times a week.

00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:41.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be thinking beforehand,
all day before the call,

00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:44.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what I wanted to tell my wife.

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:46.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we want to talk about on the phone?

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are interesting topics?

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
What funny things happened to me
and what good things?

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted my dear Irina

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel that she was the most

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:02.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
beloved wife on earth.

00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:08.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wrote about different spiritual questions
that I read in the Bible.

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:10.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wrote a little bit about love.

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:12.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, that’s important.

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s also why, in principle,
it turned out very well.

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had friends supporting me,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming over, visiting.

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:27.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got a lot of letters,

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:30.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so did Dennis.

00:05:30.058 --> 00:05:31.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were people who said,

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:36.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whenever you’re having a hard time,
you can call and text;

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we’ll come over.

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We could go on a walk with you.

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could take you shopping
so you won’t feel lonely.”

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
They offered all sorts of help,
and I am very grateful to them.

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:51.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there were even sisters
who cooked for me.

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:56.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a very great encouragement to me

00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the brothers in the congregation

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:01.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
prayed for my husband and also for me.

00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:04.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
They asked that Jehovah
would give us the strength

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure everything,
that we would be able to keep our joy

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:11.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of the situation.

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:13.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was very nice.

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that they cared for me personally.

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:21.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very worried about my pioneer ministry

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was so busy with different matters.

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know how
I could find time for the ministry.

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:31.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I talked to Jehovah about this,

00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:33.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I wanted to continue to pioneer,

00:06:33.872 --> 00:06:37.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he answered my prayers
in a very interesting way.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:40.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best preaching territory I’ve ever had

00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:42.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the detention center.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
I met a lot of interesting people there

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:48.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I spent hours waiting in line
to leave food for my husband

00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:51.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
—sometimes two, three, or four hours.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
The longest I waited
was five and a half hours.

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:58.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had the opportunity
to talk to different people.

00:06:58.814 --> 00:07:02.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people came not only from Oryol

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:06.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also from different cities,
villages, and even countries.

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:09.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was unique

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:13.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
because many people
had never even heard of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:15.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was very grateful to Jehovah

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:18.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
for giving me the opportunity to serve him

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:20.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in such circumstances.

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understood that Jehovah
truly understood me,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
understood my needs,

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:28.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
so much that he fulfilled all my desires

00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:30.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the smallest detail.

00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:34.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
He understands what is important to me,

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is valuable,
and he is ready to provide it for me.

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:42.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s early spring.

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:43.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s still cold,

00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:46.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are no leaves on the trees yet.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s still this dirty snow.

00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:51.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
And somehow I don’t like this time.

00:07:52.993 --> 00:07:55.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember looking out the window

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:56.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking to Jehovah.

00:07:56.955 --> 00:07:59.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Jehovah, somehow I feel sad.

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:03.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want something beautiful;
I want beauty.”

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I talked to Jehovah,

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:09.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the next day
one of the sisters from our congregation

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:14.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
came and gave me a big bouquet of flowers.

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, interestingly enough,
that wasn’t the only gift,

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:20.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
because as soon as those flowers wilted,

00:08:20.228 --> 00:08:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
another sister brought the next bouquet.

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this went on
until it was beautiful outside,

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:28.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the leaves were already blooming,

00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:32.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the flowers
in the front gardens were blossoming.

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:38.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
I viewed my time in prison and in the colony

00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:40.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
as my assignment from Jehovah.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:45.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sent there
not only to serve my sentence

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I was sent there to preach,

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk about Jehovah,

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:55.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Bible, about Jesus,

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:59.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Kingdom of God to other people
who maybe couldn’t listen at home

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:01.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they were in prison.

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided right away

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:07.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sadness and discouragement
were not for me.

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:11.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s not the best place on earth
(to be in prison), right?

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:13.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really, really isn’t.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
But people live here too,
and life goes on.

00:09:17.077 --> 00:09:19.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the help of Jehovah and his spirit,

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:24.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s also possible here to experience peace
and joy of heart—to be happy.

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:30.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the court sessions,

00:09:30.882 --> 00:09:35.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried really hard to show the brothers
and sisters that came to support me

00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:37.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was doing well.

00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:41.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, yes, I often talked to them
in the court and smiled at them.

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:44.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming.

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I also showed

00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
the children’s drawings that I had.

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:53.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really wanted
to strengthen and encourage them

00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:58.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could understand that,
yes, Jehovah is with me,

00:09:58.743 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if something happens to other people,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters,
they shouldn’t be afraid.

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
I really appreciate your support.

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:12.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am very happy for all your letters,

00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:15.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all your thoughts, for all your prayers.

00:10:15.177 --> 00:10:17.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it a lot.

00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:19.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I try to do my best,

00:10:19.514 --> 00:10:22.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I try to serve Jehovah
in the best way that I can.

00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:25.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will do that forever.

00:10:25.187 --> 00:10:28.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I also really liked my husband’s attitude,

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:32.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was a real shepherd to the sheep,

00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:35.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
because those people
who came to the hearings

00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:39.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
would leave in such good spirits, uplifted.

00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:45.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they would tell everybody
how interesting it was in court,

00:10:45.207 --> 00:10:48.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so they kind of energized other people

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encouraged them to come to the hearings.

00:10:52.464 --> 00:10:56.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started praying diligently
about learning to love my enemies

00:10:56.968 --> 00:10:59.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
because now I had to communicate

00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:02.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot with the Investigative Committee,

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the FSB, with the courts,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the employees of the detention center.

00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:09.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is the kind of place

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
where people are not very friendly.

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:16.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing
how Jehovah answered this prayer.

00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:20.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the head of the detention center
treated me very well.

00:11:20.867 --> 00:11:23.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “How can I help you?

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:24.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What can I do for you?

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:27.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you need help,
always come to me.”

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
The thing I realized is that all judges,

00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:35.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
prosecutors, and detention center staff

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:39.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ordinary people
who need to hear the good news.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I tried to show them by my behavior

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:45.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s Witnesses are peaceful people.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the trial,
I particularly remembered

00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:53.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
the support of the brothers and sisters.

00:11:55.944 --> 00:11:57.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful!

00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:02.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it would have been
a lot harder without that.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a lot of court sessions

00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:07.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
—at least 75.

00:12:08.248 --> 00:12:10.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were brothers and sisters
at every hearing.

00:12:14.004 --> 00:12:15.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I always thought,

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:19.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you only knew how much it means to me

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:21.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have you here.’

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes there were a lot;

00:12:23.763 --> 00:12:26.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hall was overcrowded.

00:12:26.308 --> 00:12:30.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know, too, that many of them
have sacrificed their time

00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:33.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked to leave work just to be there

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen and support me.

00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes brothers and sisters
also attended the hearings

00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:43.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other cities.

00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:47.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes maybe they wrote a little sign,

00:12:47.203 --> 00:12:50.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sign that says:
“We’re from such and such a city.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hang in there, Dennis.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you!” and so on.

00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:00.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very encouraging to me.

00:13:00.008 --> 00:13:03.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:
‘Oh, yes, life is hard,

00:13:03.762 --> 00:13:06.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but they took the time,

00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:09.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘time to be there for me in these tough times.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:11.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s just wonderful.

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:13.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing!’

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:30.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not agree with this judgment.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a big mistake.

00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:33.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:34.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am very happy that you are here.

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:40.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I got my final sentence of six years,

00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:43.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
then there were
a lot of people in the audience.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of them were human rights activists,

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:50.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
journalists,

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our brothers and sisters.

00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:58.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was also prepared for this,
for this verdict,

00:13:58.191 --> 00:14:00.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it wasn’t some kind of surprise to me.

00:14:00.944 --> 00:14:03.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took the verdict completely calmly.

00:14:03.738 --> 00:14:06.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
separation from my husband is terrible.

00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:19.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I came to the prison,
I remember one incident in particular,

00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:23.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking to the deputy head of the prison.

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:28.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew I was from Denmark;
he knew I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:14:28.221 --> 00:14:32.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to me:
“Dennis, well, yes, in Denmark

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:34.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you have a different prison system,

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:37.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but here in Russia
a man has to suffer in prison.

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:42.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this prison, you won’t preach.

00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:46.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Here you won’t talk to others about your faith,
about the Bible.

00:14:46.197 --> 00:14:47.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you understand that?”

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:53.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understood that they wanted to break me.

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:56.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was especially clear to me

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they sent me
to the punishment cell again and again.

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:05.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was worried about my husband

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was in the punishment cell

00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:10.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not being able to talk on the phone at all.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
For eight months,
we didn’t talk to each other.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We only had letters.

00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
How I dealt with it:

00:15:17.187 --> 00:15:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here again I decided a long time ago

00:15:21.524 --> 00:15:25.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sadness and discouragement
were not for me.

00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:27.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really avoided these thoughts.

00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:33.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very strict about my attitude
because I knew, basically,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it says in Proverbs:
‘If you’re sad,

00:15:36.998 --> 00:15:40.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
then your strength also disappears.’

00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:45.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew it would be a long struggle,
and I wanted to endure.

00:15:49.302 --> 00:15:50.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I came to the prison,

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a Bible.

00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:58.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I went to the library,
what Bible did I find there?

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Half of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took it right away.

00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:04.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first part is the Russian synodal;

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:07.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
the second part is the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:13.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to read the Bible every day
like I was supposed to

00:16:13.743 --> 00:16:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to meditate.

00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:19.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did have a special notebook
where I wrote down good thoughts

00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Bible that would strengthen me.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the mind is overflowing

00:16:26.422 --> 00:16:28.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
with these positive thoughts,

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
then there’s no room for negative thoughts.

00:16:32.512 --> 00:16:36.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
So every morning after the morning check,

00:16:36.307 --> 00:16:39.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would then have my Bible reading.

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:43.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible verses helped me
to stay calm and joyful.

00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:47.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:51.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often remembered Isaiah 30:15,

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:55.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says that we have to ‘keep calm
and trust in Jehovah.’

00:16:55.827 --> 00:16:58.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is our strength.

00:17:00.832 --> 00:17:05.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another scripture is Romans 12:21,

00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:09.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says
that we need to ‘conquer evil with good.’

00:17:09.966 --> 00:17:11.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that important?

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:17.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the prison world is not kindergarten.

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are real criminals,
people who behave badly.

00:17:21.477 --> 00:17:25.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried not to act like the other prisoners,

00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:27.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be aggressive.

00:17:27.817 --> 00:17:31.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was constantly thinking about that:

00:17:31.112 --> 00:17:33.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What I see is bad.

00:17:33.364 --> 00:17:35.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have to conquer this

00:17:35.366 --> 00:17:38.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘not with evil but with good.

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:40.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have to remain a Christian.’

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:46.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another scripture
that has also strengthened me

00:17:46.127 --> 00:17:49.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Psalm 84:11,

00:17:49.422 --> 00:17:52.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says that for those who act blamelessly,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not deprive them of blessings.

00:17:56.554 --> 00:17:59.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that if we do the right thing,

00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:03.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though everyone else
around you does their own thing,

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:06.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not rob us of our blessings.

00:18:09.317 --> 00:18:11.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, in difficult situations

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:13.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
you absolutely have to pray

00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:16.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you can’t calm down without it.

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:21.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes when I was having a hard time,
I prayed more than once.

00:18:21.162 --> 00:18:25.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to make my prayers more specific.

00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:29.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought a little bit beforehand about, well,

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
what I wanted to talk to Jehovah about.

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:37.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister wrote to me in a letter,

00:18:37.387 --> 00:18:42.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you want your prayers
to mean something to Jehovah,

00:18:42.058 --> 00:18:45.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
then they must mean something to you too.”

00:18:45.436 --> 00:18:47.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
And very often I prayed

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:49.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’d have peace in my heart,

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:54.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would help me
to keep my joy, to be happy,

00:18:54.153 --> 00:18:57.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I wanted it to be that way.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes when we were standing
during the morning check,

00:19:01.911 --> 00:19:06.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other prisoners would say to me:
“Dennis, you are smiling again.

00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:09.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you thinking about?”

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:13.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I said, “I just remembered
something good, something nice.”

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:16.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
And everybody was laughing at me then.

00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:20.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although prison and the colony,

00:19:20.805 --> 00:19:24.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, they’re not the best places on earth,

00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:27.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they’re not the worst either.

00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you remember why you’re there

00:19:30.606 --> 00:19:34.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when you’re busy,
busy doing good things

00:19:34.193 --> 00:19:36.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
—maybe when you’re writing letters
to other people,

00:19:36.237 --> 00:19:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to brothers, sisters, children,

00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:42.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elderly or maybe when you’re preaching—

00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:46.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, then it’s really an opportunity to be happy.

00:19:48.332 --> 00:19:52.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the joy that all of us
are supposed to have.

00:19:52.128 --> 00:19:54.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not connected to what’s around us;

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:57.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s connected to what’s inside you.

00:19:58.718 --> 00:20:03.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often thought too:
‘Yes, OK, you can steal my freedom.

00:20:03.681 --> 00:20:07.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yes, you can make me not see my family

00:20:07.226 --> 00:20:10.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and not be able to hug them
as often as I’d like.

00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:16.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But inside,
I will not let you steal my peace;

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I will not let you steal my joy.

00:20:19.947 --> 00:20:22.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I want to be happy, to serve Jehovah,

00:20:22.492 --> 00:20:25.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do as he wants
because he is a happy Father.’

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I love him.

00:20:29.957 --> 00:20:33.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
And actually, I realized right away

00:20:33.252 --> 00:20:37.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can’t feel sorry for yourself
in any way and think,

00:20:37.757 --> 00:20:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why did this happen to us?’

00:20:39.842 --> 00:20:41.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are very bad thoughts,

00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:46.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I tried to reject these thoughts
as soon as they appeared

00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and replace them with something positive.

00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:50.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it worked.

00:20:51.562 --> 00:20:54.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dennis once wrote this interesting phrase,

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:56.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you want to be happy,

00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:57.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
make others happy.”

00:20:57.944 --> 00:21:00.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that thought helped me a lot.

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:03.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this verse is also very dear to me,

00:21:03.658 --> 00:21:06.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Praised be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:10.623 --> 00:21:14.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Father of tender mercies
and the God of all comfort,

00:21:14.794 --> 00:21:18.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials

00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:21.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may be able to comfort others

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:24.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in any sort of trial

00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:26.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the comfort we receive from God.”

00:21:26.597 --> 00:21:29.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
This verse helped me to understand

00:21:29.475 --> 00:21:32.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I don’t need to focus on my own problems,

00:21:32.311 --> 00:21:34.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
but having received comfort from God,

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:37.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to go and comfort others,

00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:41.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there were so many people
around me who needed help,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to be reassured,
needed kind words and joy.

00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:48.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was always busy.

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:50.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always looking for opportunities
to help someone

00:21:50.997 --> 00:21:55.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
—who to visit and who to bring groceries to—
or to visit the sick.

00:21:56.878 --> 00:22:00.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was difficult
when I was in the pretrial detention.

00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:05.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, it’s a pretrial detention center.

00:22:05.094 --> 00:22:09.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
That meant that everything I said there
could have been used against me.

00:22:10.808 --> 00:22:13.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when I was in the prison camp,

00:22:13.436 --> 00:22:16.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a little more freedom
because in the prison camp

00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:20.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s an opportunity
to get a personal visit for three days.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that my wife
can come and visit me.

00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:26.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you can go in your own clothes;

00:22:26.032 --> 00:22:29.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can cook your own food,
well, and socialize.

00:22:29.952 --> 00:22:34.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was perfectly aware that my dear wife

00:22:34.165 --> 00:22:37.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
works very, very hard outside.

00:22:37.293 --> 00:22:39.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s always busy like a bee.

00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:44.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I made a routine that when she came,

00:22:44.383 --> 00:22:46.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d prepare the food.

00:22:46.802 --> 00:22:50.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d cook; I’d wash the dishes.

00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:53.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted her to feel like my guest

00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:56.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to enjoy, to rest, to come home.

00:22:58.105 --> 00:23:01.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really needed that at the time.

00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:03.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I came to the prison,

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:05.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was certainly a joyful time.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a lot of fun those three days.

00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:13.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so grateful to my husband
that he took very good care of me.

00:23:14.664 --> 00:23:19.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, our relationship became stronger
when Dennis was in prison

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I had never heard
so many loving expressions from my husband.

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:33.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a Bible example

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:36.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I hold even more dear now

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
than I did at the beginning of my imprisonment.

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:43.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s, of course, the apostle Paul.

00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:46.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when I read his letters now,

00:23:46.404 --> 00:23:49.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
which he wrote while he was in prison,

00:23:49.657 --> 00:23:53.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sometimes feel
that I have exactly those kinds of thoughts.

00:23:56.455 --> 00:23:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like I understand him even more.

00:23:59.542 --> 00:24:03.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I really wanted to be like him
and to act like him.

00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:07.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Paul doing when he was in prison?

00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:10.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tried to preach, talk to others.

00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:12.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what else did he do?

00:24:12.805 --> 00:24:14.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote letters.

00:24:14.432 --> 00:24:17.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that was the motivation for me.

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:18.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a goal.

00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:21.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to write three letters a day.

00:24:22.315 --> 00:24:24.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to strengthen others;

00:24:24.608 --> 00:24:26.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to encourage them.

00:24:26.652 --> 00:24:29.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to spread a little bit of joy

00:24:29.613 --> 00:24:32.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I love
my brothers and sisters so much.

00:24:33.617 --> 00:24:36.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
A member of the prison staff said to me,

00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:41.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dennis, I can see that you’re very joyful.”

00:24:41.167 --> 00:24:45.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Yes, I’ll be free soon;

00:24:45.046 --> 00:24:48.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all my thoughts are there right now.

00:24:48.007 --> 00:24:50.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s like I’m not here.

00:24:50.676 --> 00:24:53.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m already out there.”

00:24:53.304 --> 00:24:57.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he said to me,
“Look, Christensen, you’ve never been here.

00:24:57.558 --> 00:24:59.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ve always been on the outside.

00:24:59.977 --> 00:25:01.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ve always been free.

00:25:01.812 --> 00:25:04.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve always been joyful and happy.”

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:11.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also imagined that day many times:

00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:12.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’d go out,

00:25:12.448 --> 00:25:16.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’d see my brothers and sisters again
and my family,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I’d hug them.

00:25:24.377 --> 00:25:28.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m in the car then
—handcuffed, driving around—

00:25:28.214 --> 00:25:31.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I see all of our dear brothers
and sisters out there.

00:25:38.474 --> 00:25:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I only saw them for five seconds,

00:25:42.311 --> 00:25:45.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though
I only heard them for five seconds,

00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:47.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really strengthened me.

00:25:47.483 --> 00:25:49.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can just say
that my heart was jumping with joy,

00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m very grateful
to these brothers and sisters.

00:25:54.949 --> 00:25:58.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was amazed at the number of people
who were already there.

00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:00.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got there early,

00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:04.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were people
from completely different cities.

00:26:05.376 --> 00:26:07.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
They prepared posters,

00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:09.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
they blew up balloons,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
they gave me a lot of flowers

00:26:12.508 --> 00:26:15.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just huge bouquets of flowers—

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they said very beautiful words.

00:26:17.263 --> 00:26:21.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s unique that you’re not alone
in this situation

00:26:21.517 --> 00:26:23.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that, really, we’re one big family.

00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:30.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,
we had an eight-hour ride to the airport.

00:26:33.362 --> 00:26:36.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very exciting that,
yes, we were going to the airport.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon it’s all over,
and I can be with Irina again.

00:26:41.912 --> 00:26:44.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we arrived in Moscow at the airport,

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Irina met me with my lawyer
and the airport police.

00:26:48.627 --> 00:26:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, actually, it was OK but a little tough.

00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:53.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:55.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eight hours in this car.

00:26:58.721 --> 00:27:01.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were at the airport,

00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:03.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw that some people

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:05.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
smiled at me a lot.

00:27:05.811 --> 00:27:09.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I knew right away that these
were our brothers and sisters.

00:27:09.815 --> 00:27:13.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the immigration officer
looked around like that and said:

00:27:13.777 --> 00:27:16.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are these all yours?” and I said,

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:18.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yeah, they’re friends.”

00:27:19.283 --> 00:27:22.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Dennis went to hug everybody.

00:27:26.123 --> 00:27:29.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were so many
of our friends at the airport.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll tell you, if I smiled before,
I smiled even more then.

00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:36.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt so good!

00:27:42.431 --> 00:27:47.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it shows one more thing:
that what a love we have between us!

00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:48.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s real.

00:27:49.563 --> 00:27:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m crying.
I’m sorry.

00:28:19.426 --> 00:28:22.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, I would like to say

00:28:22.012 --> 00:28:25.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
that today is a happy day

00:28:25.432 --> 00:28:27.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a happy day because I,

00:28:27.768 --> 00:28:29.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least I, got freed the prison

00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:34.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I came home to Copenhagen, Denmark,

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I can again be together

00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:40.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my friends and my beloved family.

00:28:40.322 --> 00:28:45.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would also like to say that I’m very glad,

00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:49.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I appreciate
all that the brothers and sisters

00:28:49.206 --> 00:28:52.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
have done for me in these five years.

00:28:52.418 --> 00:28:55.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had no brothers and sisters close to me.

00:28:57.172 --> 00:29:01.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been, you could say,
alone for five years in prison.

00:29:01.218 --> 00:29:02.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I never felt alone.

00:29:03.596 --> 00:29:07.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m home in freedom with my family,
with my wife,

00:29:07.308 --> 00:29:10.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my thoughts also go to all

00:29:10.311 --> 00:29:13.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters in Russia,

00:29:13.188 --> 00:29:16.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
because many of them are still suffering.

00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:20.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have always felt that Jehovah’s hand
was never too short

00:29:20.988 --> 00:29:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save, to support, and to help.

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:26.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I am sure, 100 percent sure,

00:29:26.452 --> 00:29:28.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this will also happen to them.

00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:30.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people ask me:

00:29:30.664 --> 00:29:35.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, Dennis,
has the prison time crushed you?

00:29:35.002 --> 00:29:36.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they break you?”

00:29:36.837 --> 00:29:39.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
No way!
Never ever!

00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:42.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the goal that I would go out of prison

00:29:42.301 --> 00:29:45.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
even stronger in a spiritual way

00:29:45.721 --> 00:29:48.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
than I was when they put me in.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know what?

00:29:49.558 --> 00:29:52.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am more determined than ever

00:29:52.394 --> 00:29:54.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be faithful to Jehovah,

00:29:54.271 --> 00:29:56.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
more determined to preach the good news,

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help other brothers and sisters

00:29:59.026 --> 00:30:02.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other people to gain their goals.

00:30:02.446 --> 00:30:04.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal is eternal life in Paradise,

00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:08.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we will all have the opportunity
to serve and praise Jehovah forever.

00:30:08.577 --> 00:30:11.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, no, I’m not broken.

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:13.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I’m not crushed.

00:30:13.082 --> 00:30:15.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m still here.
I’m back!

00:30:20.673 --> 00:30:22.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re back in Denmark.

00:30:24.134 --> 00:30:28.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we have to start a new life,
start from scratch.

00:30:28.555 --> 00:30:32.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know it’s not going to be
all smooth sailing for Irina,

00:30:32.601 --> 00:30:34.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I will be there for her.

00:30:34.937 --> 00:30:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will definitely support her, help her,

00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:43.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will continue
to try to be a good husband

00:30:43.278 --> 00:30:47.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will continue to show that I love her
and will take care of her.

00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:57.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had an invaluable and unique experience

00:30:57.626 --> 00:31:00.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we really want to use to help others.

00:31:03.966 --> 00:31:08.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really want our brothers and sisters
to know that it is possible

00:31:08.178 --> 00:31:10.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
to survive and that Jehovah is near.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you should never give up;

00:31:12.975 --> 00:31:15.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should never lose heart.

00:31:16.395 --> 00:31:19.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned to trust Jehovah

00:31:19.022 --> 00:31:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to rely on him completely

00:31:20.774 --> 00:31:23.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not doubt that he will find

00:31:23.235 --> 00:31:25.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best way out of any situation.

00:31:26.864 --> 00:31:30.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah showed that he will always help.

00:31:31.493 --> 00:31:34.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can tell you that all these trials

00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:36.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they strengthened my faith.

00:31:40.502 --> 00:31:43.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen that Jehovah is right beside me.

00:31:43.213 --> 00:31:47.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen that Jesus leads our organization

00:31:47.217 --> 00:31:49.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a wonderful way

00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:52.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is a very caring King,

00:31:52.264 --> 00:31:54.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there were different needs.

00:31:54.308 --> 00:31:55.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
He met them all.

00:31:55.934 --> 00:31:59.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were different problems,
but he helped me to cope with them.

00:32:01.023 --> 00:32:05.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yes, it was as if Jehovah
became more real to me.

00:32:11.825 --> 00:32:14.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say that prison is a very good school

00:32:14.244 --> 00:32:17.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
to polish your Christian qualities.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also knows
that we are only little people.

00:32:25.672 --> 00:32:27.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
He won’t expect more of you

00:32:27.674 --> 00:32:29.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you can give or do,

00:32:31.637 --> 00:32:33.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s enough.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use what you can in all situations.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, do what you can,
and Jehovah takes care of the rest.

00:32:42.314 --> 00:32:45.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m out now,
and I’m very happy about that.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my prayers for my brothers and sisters

00:32:47.861 --> 00:32:51.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are still in prison haven’t changed.

00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:52.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the contrary,

00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:57.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pray for them even more now
because I know what they’re facing there.

00:33:01.458 --> 00:33:03.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not always easy,

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m also sure that Jehovah
helps them as he helped me.
