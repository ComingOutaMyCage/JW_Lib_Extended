00:00:09 We were at a meeting of our congregation in the city of Oryol.
00:00:16 But then one of our ministerial servants came running to me and said,
00:00:20 “Dennis, you have to go in the hallway.”
00:00:22 “OK, OK.”
00:00:24 I then went in the corridor, and there were people standing there in masks
00:00:29 —a lot of police officers and a lot of FSB people.
00:00:34 They showed their IDs and said that they were going to search our hall.
00:00:41 I certainly didn’t know exactly what to do in that situation.
00:00:45 I mean, this is the first time for me.
00:00:47 But I know one thing:
00:00:49 that I am an elder in this congregation
00:00:51 and the shepherd of my brothers and sisters
00:00:53 and that I must keep them safe and try to keep them calm.
00:00:57 And then I was sure that the situation would be resolved sooner or later.
00:01:02 They behaved very rudely at first.
00:01:06 But then after a few minutes,
00:01:08 they completely calmed down,
00:01:11 sat there in the front row, and looked at me with very strange faces,
00:01:15 as if they said: “Look, what are we even doing here?
00:01:20 “Here are grandmothers, women, and children.
00:01:23 Well, it’s all peaceful and quiet.”
00:01:30 I was sure everything was legal on our part
00:01:33 when they told me, “So Dennis, we’ll take you in for two days.”
00:01:37 I thought: ‘Well, it’s no big deal, and it’s going to be resolved.
00:01:41 ‘Two days is something I can live with.
00:01:43 Other brothers and sisters were in prison before me, and I can do it too.’
00:01:48 And I was sure, too, that Jehovah was protecting me.
00:02:00 I think it was 11 o’clock in the evening.
00:02:03 They took me to the cell.
00:02:05 I arrived in my suit.
00:02:07 I had a jacket, a tie, and a shirt.
00:02:10 And you might say that the other prisoners
00:02:12 looked at me like I was from the moon.
00:02:16 I didn’t know what lay ahead of me.
00:02:18 I also had no experience of being in prison,
00:02:21 but I decided, ‘OK, I need to take the first step.’
00:02:26 Then I came to the other prisoners and said,  “Hello, my name is Dennis.”
00:02:34 The hardest part was being separated from my wife, Irina.
00:02:39 I was really worried about her health:
00:02:41 ‘Does she have what she needs materially?
00:02:44 ‘Are they hounding her as well?
00:02:48 Will she end up next to me in prison?’
00:02:52 A lot of thoughts were on my mind,
00:02:54 and that’s why the first two months were the hardest for me.
00:03:01 The detention center is located
00:03:04 so that you can’t generally see the prisoners, right?
00:03:07 I tried to find a place where I could see his window.
00:03:12 And just from his window, he could see me well.
00:03:16 And so we agreed that I would go there.
00:03:19 Dennis told me what time.
00:03:23 That was my favorite time, you might say, of the whole day.
00:03:27 I was looking forward to 1:00 p.m.,
00:03:29 my opportunity to see Irina.
00:03:32 It was only five to ten minutes.
00:03:36 For two years we had this routine.
00:03:40 Irina came every day!
00:03:43 In the snow,
00:03:45 in the rain, in bright sunshine
00:03:47 —no matter what the weather was,
00:03:50 every day she was there.
00:03:54 It was our little secret that we reveal now.
00:03:58 For two years, we didn’t tell it to anyone at all.
00:04:05 He used to write me really funny letters
00:04:07 and draw some funny drawings
00:04:10 to make me laugh a little bit and cheer me up,
00:04:13 because we are that sort of family.
00:04:16 We’re always laughing and making jokes.
00:04:20 I really tried my best to be a good husband.
00:04:23 When I was in the detention center,
00:04:26 I tried to call her twice a month.
00:04:29 I tried to write her letters
00:04:31 five times a week.
00:04:38 I would be thinking beforehand, all day before the call,
00:04:41 about what I wanted to tell my wife.
00:04:44 What do we want to talk about on the phone?
00:04:46 What are interesting topics?
00:04:48 What funny things happened to me and what good things?
00:04:53 I wanted my dear Irina
00:04:56 to feel that she was the most
00:04:58 beloved wife on earth.
00:05:04 I wrote about different spiritual questions that I read in the Bible.
00:05:08 I wrote a little bit about love.
00:05:10 I mean, that’s important.
00:05:15 But that’s also why, in principle, it turned out very well.
00:05:22 I had friends supporting me,
00:05:24 coming over, visiting.
00:05:26 I got a lot of letters,
00:05:27 and so did Dennis.
00:05:30 There were people who said,
00:05:31 “Whenever you’re having a hard time, you can call and text;
00:05:36 “we’ll come over.
00:05:37 “We could go on a walk with you.
00:05:39 We could take you shopping so you won’t feel lonely.”
00:05:43 They offered all sorts of help, and I am very grateful to them.
00:05:48 And there were even sisters who cooked for me.
00:05:53 It was a very great encouragement to me
00:05:56 when the brothers in the congregation
00:05:58 prayed for my husband and also for me.
00:06:01 They asked that Jehovah would give us the strength
00:06:04 to endure everything, that we would be able to keep our joy
00:06:09 in spite of the situation.
00:06:11 And that was very nice.
00:06:13 I felt that they cared for me personally.
00:06:18 I was very worried about my pioneer ministry
00:06:21 because I was so busy with different matters.
00:06:24 I didn’t know how I could find time for the ministry.
00:06:28 So I talked to Jehovah about this,
00:06:31 that I wanted to continue to pioneer,
00:06:33 and he answered my prayers in a very interesting way.
00:06:37 The best preaching territory I’ve ever had
00:06:40 was the detention center.
00:06:42 I met a lot of interesting people there
00:06:44 because I spent hours waiting in line to leave food for my husband
00:06:48 —sometimes two, three, or four hours.
00:06:51 The longest I waited was five and a half hours.
00:06:55 So I had the opportunity to talk to different people.
00:06:58 And people came not only from Oryol
00:07:02 but also from different cities, villages, and even countries.
00:07:06 And it was unique
00:07:09 because many people had never even heard of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:07:13 and I was very grateful to Jehovah
00:07:15 for giving me the opportunity to serve him
00:07:18 even in such circumstances.
00:07:20 I understood that Jehovah truly understood me,
00:07:23 understood my needs,
00:07:25 so much that he fulfilled all my desires
00:07:28 even in the smallest detail.
00:07:30 He understands what is important to me,
00:07:34 what is valuable, and he is ready to provide it for me.
00:07:40 It’s early spring.
00:07:42 It’s still cold,
00:07:43 and there are no leaves on the trees yet.
00:07:46 There’s still this dirty snow.
00:07:49 And somehow I don’t like this time.
00:07:52 I remember looking out the window
00:07:55 and talking to Jehovah.
00:07:56 I said: “Jehovah, somehow I feel sad.
00:07:59 I want something beautiful; I want beauty.”
00:08:03 Well, I talked to Jehovah,
00:08:05 and the next day one of the sisters from our congregation
00:08:09 came and gave me a big bouquet of flowers.
00:08:14 And, interestingly enough, that wasn’t the only gift,
00:08:17 because as soon as those flowers wilted,
00:08:20 another sister brought the next bouquet.
00:08:22 And this went on until it was beautiful outside,
00:08:26 when the leaves were already blooming,
00:08:28 when the flowers in the front gardens were blossoming.
00:08:34 I viewed my time in prison and in the colony
00:08:38 as my assignment from Jehovah.
00:08:41 I was sent there not only to serve my sentence
00:08:46 —I was sent there to preach,
00:08:48 to talk about Jehovah,
00:08:51 about the Bible, about Jesus,
00:08:55 about the Kingdom of God to other people who maybe couldn’t listen at home
00:08:59 because they were in prison.
00:09:02 I decided right away
00:09:04 that sadness and discouragement were not for me.
00:09:07 Well, it’s not the best place on earth (to be in prison), right?
00:09:11 It really, really isn’t.
00:09:13 But people live here too, and life goes on.
00:09:17 With the help of Jehovah and his spirit,
00:09:19 it’s also possible here to experience peace and joy of heart—to be happy.
00:09:28 During the court sessions,
00:09:30 I tried really hard to show the brothers and sisters that came to support me
00:09:36 that I was doing well.
00:09:37 And so, yes, I often talked to them in the court and smiled at them.
00:09:42 Thank you for coming.
00:09:44 Sometimes I also showed
00:09:46 the children’s drawings that I had.
00:09:50 I really wanted to strengthen and encourage them
00:09:55 so that they could understand that, yes, Jehovah is with me,
00:09:58 and if something happens to other people,
00:10:00 our brothers and sisters, they shouldn’t be afraid.
00:10:05 Dear brothers and sisters, I really appreciate your support.
00:10:09 I am very happy for all your letters,
00:10:12 for all your thoughts, for all your prayers.
00:10:15 I really appreciate it a lot.
00:10:17 I try to do my best,
00:10:19 and I try to serve Jehovah in the best way that I can.
00:10:22 I will do that forever.
00:10:25 And I also really liked my husband’s attitude,
00:10:29 that he was a real shepherd to the sheep,
00:10:32 because those people who came to the hearings
00:10:35 would leave in such good spirits, uplifted.
00:10:41 And they would tell everybody how interesting it was in court,
00:10:45 and so they kind of energized other people
00:10:48 and encouraged them to come to the hearings.
00:10:52 I started praying diligently about learning to love my enemies
00:10:56 because now I had to communicate
00:10:59 a lot with the Investigative Committee,
00:11:02 with the FSB, with the courts,
00:11:05 with the employees of the detention center.
00:11:08 And this is the kind of place
00:11:09 where people are not very friendly.
00:11:12 It’s amazing how Jehovah answered this prayer.
00:11:16 For example, the head of the detention center treated me very well.
00:11:20 He said: “How can I help you?
00:11:23 “What can I do for you?
00:11:24 If you need help, always come to me.”
00:11:29 The thing I realized is that all judges,
00:11:32 prosecutors, and detention center staff
00:11:35 are ordinary people who need to hear the good news.
00:11:39 And I tried to show them by my behavior
00:11:42 that Jehovah’s Witnesses are peaceful people.
00:11:48 During the trial, I particularly remembered
00:11:51 the support of the brothers and sisters.
00:11:55 It’s wonderful!
00:11:57 And it would have been a lot harder without that.
00:12:02 I had a lot of court sessions
00:12:05 —at least 75.
00:12:08 I really appreciate it. Thank you.
00:12:10 There were brothers and sisters at every hearing.
00:12:14 But I always thought,
00:12:15 ‘If you only knew how much it means to me
00:12:19 to have you here.’
00:12:21 Sometimes there were a lot;
00:12:23 the hall was overcrowded.
00:12:26 And I know, too, that many of them have sacrificed their time
00:12:30 and asked to leave work just to be there
00:12:33 to strengthen and support me.
00:12:37 Sometimes brothers and sisters also attended the hearings
00:12:41 from other cities.
00:12:43 And sometimes maybe they wrote a little sign,
00:12:47 a sign that says: “We’re from such and such a city.
00:12:50 “Hang in there, Dennis.
00:12:52 We love you!” and so on.
00:12:57 It was very encouraging to me.
00:13:00 And I thought: ‘Oh, yes, life is hard,
00:13:03 ‘but they took the time,
00:13:06 ‘time to be there for me in these tough times.
00:13:09 ‘It’s just wonderful.
00:13:11 It’s amazing!’
00:13:28 I do not agree with this judgment.
00:13:30 This is a big mistake.
00:13:31 But thank you, everybody, for coming.
00:13:33 I am very happy that you are here.
00:13:34 Thank you!
00:13:37 When I got my final sentence of six years,
00:13:40 then there were a lot of people in the audience.
00:13:45 Most of them were human rights activists,
00:13:49 journalists,
00:13:50 and our brothers and sisters.
00:13:54 I was also prepared for this, for this verdict,
00:13:58 and it wasn’t some kind of surprise to me.
00:14:00 I took the verdict completely calmly.
00:14:03 Of course, separation from my husband is terrible.
00:14:15 When I came to the prison, I remember one incident in particular,
00:14:19 talking to the deputy head of the prison.
00:14:23 He knew I was from Denmark; he knew I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:14:28 He said to me: “Dennis, well, yes, in Denmark
00:14:32 “you have a different prison system,
00:14:34 “but here in Russia a man has to suffer in prison.
00:14:39 “In this prison, you won’t preach.
00:14:42 “Here you won’t talk to others about your faith, about the Bible.
00:14:46 Do you understand that?”
00:14:50 I understood that they wanted to break me.
00:14:53 It was especially clear to me
00:14:56 when they sent me to the punishment cell again and again.
00:15:02 I was worried about my husband
00:15:05 when he was in the punishment cell
00:15:07 and not being able to talk on the phone at all.
00:15:10 For eight months, we didn’t talk to each other.
00:15:13 We only had letters.
00:15:15 How I dealt with it:
00:15:17 Well, here again I decided a long time ago
00:15:21 that sadness and discouragement were not for me.
00:15:25 I really avoided these thoughts.
00:15:28 I was very strict about my attitude because I knew, basically,
00:15:33 as it says in Proverbs: ‘If you’re sad,
00:15:36 then your strength also disappears.’
00:15:40 I knew it would be a long struggle, and I wanted to endure.
00:15:49 When I came to the prison,
00:15:50 I didn’t have a Bible.
00:15:53 But when I went to the library, what Bible did I find there?
00:15:58 Half of the New World Translation.
00:16:00 I took it right away.
00:16:02 The first part is the Russian synodal;
00:16:04 the second part is the New World Translation.
00:16:09 I tried to read the Bible every day like I was supposed to
00:16:13 and to meditate.
00:16:15 I did have a special notebook where I wrote down good thoughts
00:16:19 from the Bible that would strengthen me.
00:16:24 When the mind is overflowing
00:16:26 with these positive thoughts,
00:16:28 then there’s no room for negative thoughts.
00:16:32 So every morning after the morning check,
00:16:36 I would then have my Bible reading.
00:16:39 Bible verses helped me to stay calm and joyful.
00:16:45 For example,
00:16:47 I often remembered Isaiah 30:15,
00:16:51 where it says that we have to ‘keep calm and trust in Jehovah.’
00:16:55 And that is our strength.
00:17:00 Another scripture is Romans 12:21,
00:17:05 where it says that we need to ‘conquer evil with good.’
00:17:09 Why is that important?
00:17:13 Because the prison world is not kindergarten.
00:17:17 There are real criminals, people who behave badly.
00:17:21 I tried not to act like the other prisoners,
00:17:26 not to be aggressive.
00:17:27 I was constantly thinking about that:
00:17:31 ‘What I see is bad.
00:17:33 ‘I have to conquer this
00:17:35 ‘not with evil but with good.
00:17:38 I have to remain a Christian.’
00:17:43 Another scripture that has also strengthened me
00:17:46 is Psalm 84:11,
00:17:49 which says that for those who act blamelessly,
00:17:52 Jehovah does not deprive them of blessings.
00:17:56 This means that if we do the right thing,
00:17:59 even though everyone else around you does their own thing,
00:18:03 Jehovah does not rob us of our blessings.
00:18:09 Of course, in difficult situations
00:18:11 you absolutely have to pray
00:18:13 because you can’t calm down without it.
00:18:16 Sometimes when I was having a hard time, I prayed more than once.
00:18:21 I tried to make my prayers more specific.
00:18:25 I thought a little bit beforehand about, well,
00:18:29 what I wanted to talk to Jehovah about.
00:18:34 One sister wrote to me in a letter,
00:18:37 “If you want your prayers to mean something to Jehovah,
00:18:42 then they must mean something to you too.”
00:18:45 And very often I prayed
00:18:47 that I’d have peace in my heart,
00:18:49 that Jehovah would help me to keep my joy, to be happy,
00:18:54 because I wanted it to be that way.
00:18:58 Sometimes when we were standing during the morning check,
00:19:01 the other prisoners would say to me: “Dennis, you are smiling again.
00:19:06 What are you thinking about?”
00:19:09 And then I said, “I just remembered something good, something nice.”
00:19:13 And everybody was laughing at me then.
00:19:18 Although prison and the colony,
00:19:20 yes, they’re not the best places on earth,
00:19:24 but they’re not the worst either.
00:19:27 And when you remember why you’re there
00:19:30 and when you’re busy, busy doing good things
00:19:34 —maybe when you’re writing letters to other people,
00:19:36 to brothers, sisters, children,
00:19:39 the elderly or maybe when you’re preaching—
00:19:42 yes, then it’s really an opportunity to be happy.
00:19:48 That’s the joy that all of us are supposed to have.
00:19:52 It’s not connected to what’s around us;
00:19:54 it’s connected to what’s inside you.
00:19:58 I often thought too: ‘Yes, OK, you can steal my freedom.
00:20:03 ‘Yes, you can make me not see my family
00:20:07 ‘and not be able to hug them as often as I’d like.
00:20:11 ‘But inside, I will not let you steal my peace;
00:20:16 ‘I will not let you steal my joy.
00:20:19 ‘I want to be happy, to serve Jehovah,
00:20:22 to do as he wants because he is a happy Father.’
00:20:25 And I love him.
00:20:29 And actually, I realized right away
00:20:33 that you can’t feel sorry for yourself in any way and think,
00:20:37 ‘Why did this happen to us?’
00:20:39 These are very bad thoughts,
00:20:41 and I tried to reject these thoughts as soon as they appeared
00:20:46 and replace them with something positive.
00:20:49 And it worked.
00:20:51 Dennis once wrote this interesting phrase,
00:20:54 “If you want to be happy,
00:20:56 make others happy.”
00:20:57 And that thought helped me a lot.
00:21:00 So this verse is also very dear to me,
00:21:03 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:
00:21:06 “Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00:21:10 “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort,
00:21:14 “who comforts us in all our trials
00:21:18 “so that we may be able to comfort others
00:21:21 “in any sort of trial
00:21:24 with the comfort we receive from God.”
00:21:26 This verse helped me to understand
00:21:29 that I don’t need to focus on my own problems,
00:21:32 but having received comfort from God,
00:21:34 I need to go and comfort others,
00:21:37 because there were so many people around me who needed help,
00:21:41 needed to be reassured, needed kind words and joy.
00:21:45 And I was always busy.
00:21:48 I was always looking for opportunities to help someone
00:21:50 —who to visit and who to bring groceries to— or to visit the sick.
00:21:56 It was difficult when I was in the pretrial detention.
00:22:00 After all, it’s a pretrial detention center.
00:22:05 That meant that everything I said there could have been used against me.
00:22:10 Then when I was in the prison camp,
00:22:13 I had a little more freedom because in the prison camp
00:22:16 there’s an opportunity to get a personal visit for three days.
00:22:20 That means that my wife can come and visit me.
00:22:23 There you can go in your own clothes;
00:22:26 you can cook your own food, well, and socialize.
00:22:29 And I was perfectly aware that my dear wife
00:22:34 works very, very hard outside.
00:22:37 She’s always busy like a bee.
00:22:39 So I made a routine that when she came,
00:22:44 I’d prepare the food.
00:22:46 I’d cook; I’d wash the dishes.
00:22:50 I wanted her to feel like my guest
00:22:53 —to enjoy, to rest, to come home.
00:22:58 I really needed that at the time.
00:23:01 And when I came to the prison,
00:23:03 it was certainly a joyful time.
00:23:05 We had a lot of fun those three days.
00:23:08 I was so grateful to my husband that he took very good care of me.
00:23:14 Honestly, our relationship became stronger when Dennis was in prison
00:23:19 because I had never heard so many loving expressions from my husband.
00:23:31 I have a Bible example
00:23:33 that I hold even more dear now
00:23:36 than I did at the beginning of my imprisonment.
00:23:40 It’s, of course, the apostle Paul.
00:23:43 Because when I read his letters now,
00:23:46 which he wrote while he was in prison,
00:23:49 I sometimes feel that I have exactly those kinds of thoughts.
00:23:56 I feel like I understand him even more.
00:23:59 And I really wanted to be like him and to act like him.
00:24:03 What was Paul doing when he was in prison?
00:24:07 He tried to preach, talk to others.
00:24:10 But what else did he do?
00:24:12 He wrote letters.
00:24:14 And so that was the motivation for me.
00:24:17 I had a goal.
00:24:18 I tried to write three letters a day.
00:24:22 I wanted to strengthen others;
00:24:24 I wanted to encourage them.
00:24:26 I wanted to spread a little bit of joy
00:24:29 because I love my brothers and sisters so much.
00:24:33 A member of the prison staff said to me,
00:24:36 “Dennis, I can see that you’re very joyful.”
00:24:41 I said: “Yes, I’ll be free soon;
00:24:45 “all my thoughts are there right now.
00:24:48 “It’s like I’m not here.
00:24:50 I’m already out there.”
00:24:53 Then he said to me, “Look, Christensen, you’ve never been here.
00:24:57 “You’ve always been on the outside.
00:24:59 “You’ve always been free.
00:25:01 You’ve always been joyful and happy.”
00:25:07 I also imagined that day many times:
00:25:11 when I’d go out,
00:25:12 when I’d see my brothers and sisters again and my family,
00:25:16 and when I’d hug them.
00:25:24 I’m in the car then —handcuffed, driving around—
00:25:28 and I see all of our dear brothers and sisters out there.
00:25:38 Even though I only saw them for five seconds,
00:25:42 even though I only heard them for five seconds,
00:25:45 it really strengthened me.
00:25:47 I can just say that my heart was jumping with joy,
00:25:49 and I’m very grateful to these brothers and sisters.
00:25:54 I was amazed at the number of people who were already there.
00:25:58 They got there early,
00:26:00 and they were people from completely different cities.
00:26:05 They prepared posters,
00:26:07 they blew up balloons,
00:26:09 they gave me a lot of flowers
00:26:12 —just huge bouquets of flowers—
00:26:15 and they said very beautiful words.
00:26:17 So it’s unique that you’re not alone in this situation
00:26:21 —that, really, we’re one big family.
00:26:26 After that, we had an eight-hour ride to the airport.
00:26:33 It was very exciting that, yes, we were going to the airport.
00:26:36 Soon it’s all over, and I can be with Irina again.
00:26:41 When we arrived in Moscow at the airport,
00:26:44 then Irina met me with my lawyer and the airport police.
00:26:48 Well, actually, it was OK but a little tough.
00:26:52 OK.
00:26:53 Eight hours in this car.
00:26:58 When we were at the airport,
00:27:01 I saw that some people
00:27:03 smiled at me a lot.
00:27:05 And I knew right away that these were our brothers and sisters.
00:27:09 And the immigration officer looked around like that and said:
00:27:13 “Are these all yours?” and I said,
00:27:16 “Yeah, they’re friends.”
00:27:19 And then Dennis went to hug everybody.
00:27:26 There were so many of our friends at the airport.
00:27:29 I’ll tell you, if I smiled before, I smiled even more then.
00:27:34 It felt so good!
00:27:42 And it shows one more thing: that what a love we have between us!
00:27:47 It’s real.
00:27:49 I’m crying. I’m sorry.
00:28:19 Well, first of all, I would like to say
00:28:22 that today is a happy day
00:28:25 —a happy day because I,
00:28:27 at least I, got freed the prison
00:28:29 and I came home to Copenhagen, Denmark,
00:28:34 where I can again be together
00:28:37 with my friends and my beloved family.
00:28:40 I would also like to say that I’m very glad,
00:28:45 and I appreciate all that the brothers and sisters
00:28:49 have done for me in these five years.
00:28:52 I had no brothers and sisters close to me.
00:28:57 I’ve been, you could say, alone for five years in prison.
00:29:01 But I never felt alone.
00:29:03 I’m home in freedom with my family, with my wife,
00:29:07 but my thoughts also go to all
00:29:10 of our dear brothers and sisters in Russia,
00:29:13 because many of them are still suffering.
00:29:16 I have always felt that Jehovah’s hand was never too short
00:29:20 to save, to support, and to help.
00:29:24 And I am sure, 100 percent sure,
00:29:26 that this will also happen to them.
00:29:28 Many people ask me:
00:29:30 “Oh, Dennis, has the prison time crushed you?
00:29:35 Did they break you?”
00:29:36 No way! Never ever!
00:29:39 I had the goal that I would go out of prison
00:29:42 even stronger in a spiritual way
00:29:45 than I was when they put me in.
00:29:48 And you know what?
00:29:49 I am more determined than ever
00:29:52 to be faithful to Jehovah,
00:29:54 more determined to preach the good news,
00:29:56 to help other brothers and sisters
00:29:59 and other people to gain their goals.
00:30:02 The goal is eternal life in Paradise,
00:30:04 where we will all have the opportunity to serve and praise Jehovah forever.
00:30:08 So, no, I’m not broken.
00:30:11 No, I’m not crushed.
00:30:13 I’m still here. I’m back!
00:30:20 Now we’re back in Denmark.
00:30:24 Here we have to start a new life, start from scratch.
00:30:28 I know it’s not going to be all smooth sailing for Irina,
00:30:32 but I will be there for her.
00:30:34 I will definitely support her, help her,
00:30:39 and I will continue to try to be a good husband
00:30:43 and will continue to show that I love her and will take care of her.
00:30:54 We had an invaluable and unique experience
00:30:57 that we really want to use to help others.
00:31:03 We really want our brothers and sisters to know that it is possible
00:31:08 to survive and that Jehovah is near.
00:31:11 And you should never give up;
00:31:12 you should never lose heart.
00:31:16 I’ve learned to trust Jehovah
00:31:19 and to rely on him completely
00:31:20 and not doubt that he will find
00:31:23 the best way out of any situation.
00:31:26 Jehovah showed that he will always help.
00:31:31 I can tell you that all these trials
00:31:34 —they strengthened my faith.
00:31:40 I’ve seen that Jehovah is right beside me.
00:31:43 I’ve seen that Jesus leads our organization
00:31:47 in a wonderful way
00:31:49 and is a very caring King,
00:31:52 because there were different needs.
00:31:54 He met them all.
00:31:55 There were different problems, but he helped me to cope with them.
00:32:01 So, yes, it was as if Jehovah became more real to me.
00:32:11 You could say that prison is a very good school
00:32:14 to polish your Christian qualities.
00:32:21 Jehovah also knows that we are only little people.
00:32:25 He won’t expect more of you
00:32:27 than you can give or do,
00:32:31 and that’s enough.
00:32:33 Use what you can in all situations.
00:32:36 Yes, do what you can, and Jehovah takes care of the rest.
00:32:42 I’m out now, and I’m very happy about that.
00:32:45 But my prayers for my brothers and sisters
00:32:47 who are still in prison haven’t changed.
00:32:51 On the contrary,
00:32:52 I pray for them even more now because I know what they’re facing there.
00:33:01 It’s not always easy,
00:33:03 but I’m also sure that Jehovah helps them as he helped me.
