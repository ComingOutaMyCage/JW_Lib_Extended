00:00:01 Well, we have many fine examples
00:00:02 of those who have maintained their focus
00:00:05 during extreme life events.
00:00:08 Consider the experience of Felix and Mayra Terrazas
00:00:12 in the following prerecorded interview.
00:00:17 Well, it’s a privilege to be with Felix and Mayra Terrazas,
00:00:19 serving at Wallkill.
00:00:21 We understand
00:00:22 it’s been a very difficult year.
00:00:24 Could you share some of the details of your medical condition?
00:00:29 Well, about a year and a half ago,
00:00:30 I started developing an infrequent pain in my chest,
00:00:34 which led me to seeing several doctors.
00:00:37 Soon thereafter, I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor
00:00:42 that was only going to be treatable by its complete removal.
00:00:46 After the surgery, we were hoping  to hear good news moving forward.
00:00:50 Then, a few weeks later,
00:00:53 one of my doctors conveyed to us some of the most difficult words
00:00:57 that one could imagine hearing
00:00:59 —a life expectancy of just a few months.
00:01:02 Wow!
00:01:03 That had to have been difficult to hear.
00:01:06 How were you able to get your mind wrapped around that?
00:01:09 Well, as you can imagine,  after many intense and tearful prayers
00:01:14 asking Jehovah to give us peace of mind
00:01:17 and to give us a calm heart and wisdom to make a good decision,
00:01:22 we decided on a treatment of hospice care
00:01:26 that would allow me to make the most of the time that I had left
00:01:30 and to be able to give my very best to Jehovah.
00:01:35 That’s remarkable, Felix.
00:01:37 And, Mayra, you’re such a supportive wife.
00:01:40 How have you been able to be so positive?
00:01:43 I have to say that it is my hope in Jehovah.
00:01:46 That is what has helped me.
00:01:48 At the moment, we are ‘sharing in the sufferings’
00:01:50 mentioned at 2 Corinthians 1:7.
00:01:53 But the verse concludes  that ‘we will also share in the comfort,’
00:01:57 and we are also experiencing that right now.
00:02:01 I have no doubt that I’ll see Felix again in the resurrection.
00:02:04 When I look to the future,
00:02:06 I can vividly picture us walking through the Paradise earth,
00:02:10 enjoying Jehovah’s beautiful creation.
00:02:12 This is the life, “the real life,”  that Jehovah promises.
00:02:16 And it’s this hope that gives me joy and peace.
00:02:21 Beautifully expressed.
00:02:22 Thank you.
00:02:23 And, Felix, how have you been able to be so joyful?
00:02:28 My relationship with Jehovah has never been stronger than it is right now.
00:02:32 And I believe that it’s this closeness and this intimacy with him
00:02:37 that is providing me the joy that I’m experiencing.
00:02:41 Now, Philippians 4:6, 7
00:02:44 assures me that “by prayer and [by] supplication,”
00:02:48 it says that “the peace of God . . . will guard your hearts.”
00:02:52 Prayer has been so indispensable
00:02:55 in bringing me peace during this process,
00:02:57 and it’s also amplified my appreciation for the resurrection
00:03:01 like I’ve never experienced before.
00:03:04 Proverbs 12:25, I think,
00:03:07 perfectly illustrates our current situation.
00:03:10 There it says: “Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,
00:03:15 but a good word [it says that it] cheers it up.”
00:03:20 Both Mayra and I have benefited
00:03:23 from what we feel is an enormous storehouse
00:03:27 of good words received in the way of concern,
00:03:30 of love and compassion, from the brotherhood.
00:03:33 And last, my current circumstances
00:03:37 have opened up such a wonderful opportunity
00:03:40 to share Kingdom truths with family members,
00:03:43 including the beautiful privilege of being able to study the Bible
00:03:47 with my mother during the past few months.
00:03:50 Wow!
00:03:50 Amazing!
00:03:52 Tell us, how has this experience
00:03:55 affected your faith and trust in Jehovah?
00:03:58 Well, we have seen Jehovah’s hand from the very beginning,
00:04:01 but one time sticks out in my mind.
00:04:04 It was the day we received Felix’s prognosis.
00:04:08 That evening, the Bethel family Watchtower  Study
00:04:10 considered the article “Keep Calm and Trust in Jehovah,”
00:04:15 and this was followed by a lecture
00:04:17 entitled “Remain in Jehovah’s Everlasting Arms.”
00:04:21 Jehovah provided us exactly what we needed to hear
00:04:25 that very day.
00:04:27 We felt it was an answer to our prayers,
00:04:30 as if to reassure us that he has everything under control.
00:04:34 This has strengthened my faith in that Jehovah will continue
00:04:37 to “more than superabundantly” provide for us care and guidance
00:04:42 as we face new challenges
00:04:44 and will without a doubt fulfill his promises for the future.
00:04:50 I think when you come to understand that you only have a short time to live,
00:04:55 you know, that’s something that can very easily knock you right off of your feet.
00:04:59 But we know that we have been grasped
00:05:03 by Jehovah’s caring hands right now,
00:05:05 and that is what’s stabilized us.
00:05:09 You know, throughout this ordeal, we have seen Jehovah’s love
00:05:13 —his care and assistance—
00:05:15 in every decision, in every step, that we’ve taken.
00:05:19 From the first visits to the doctors, through surgery,
00:05:22 and into the most difficult part of the prognosis,
00:05:25 we have lacked nothing.
00:05:28 I absolutely know that my faith
00:05:31 has only been strengthened by the challenges of this trial.
00:05:36 So now as I prepare to close my eyes
00:05:39 and fall asleep for just a brief time,
00:05:43 it is a privilege for me to demonstrate to Jehovah my trust
00:05:47 in all of his promises
00:05:49 and to maintain complete integrity right down to the end.
00:05:55 What an outstanding expression of faith!
00:05:57 Thank you both so much for sharing
00:05:59 those deeply personal and motivating expressions.
00:06:04 You are a living example of faith in action,
00:06:07 and we love you.
00:06:10 I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen that, and it’s so moving each time.
00:06:15 On June 8, 2021, our dear brother Felix went to sleep in death,
00:06:20 just seven weeks after this interview.
00:06:23 And any, frankly, that were around the Terrazas during this time
00:06:27 would see firsthand
00:06:29 the power of faith
00:06:32 and their focus on wanting to give Jehovah their absolute best.
00:06:36 It was tremendous!
00:06:37 Mayra, dear Mayra, continues to show
00:06:40 that same faith and endurance even now.
00:06:43 And Felix’s mother
00:06:45 —she has continued to progress spiritually, we understand.
00:06:48 Felix will be so happy to hear that.
