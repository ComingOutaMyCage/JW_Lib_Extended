WEBVTT

00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:02.899 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we have many fine examples

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.151 line:10% position:50% align:center
of those who have maintained their focus

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:08.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
during extreme life events.

00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:12.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the experience
of Felix and Mayra Terrazas

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:15.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the following prerecorded interview.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a privilege
to be with Felix and Mayra Terrazas,

00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:21.253 line:10% position:50% align:center
serving at Wallkill.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.463 line:10% position:50% align:center
We understand

00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:24.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s been a very difficult year.

00:00:24.673 --> 00:00:28.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you share some of the details
of your medical condition?

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:30.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, about a year and a half ago,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started developing
an infrequent pain in my chest,

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:36.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
which led me to seeing several doctors.

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:42.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon thereafter,
I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:46.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was only going to be treatable
by its complete removal.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the surgery, we were hoping 
to hear good news moving forward.

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:53.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, a few weeks later,

00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:57.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of my doctors conveyed
to us some of the most difficult words

00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:59.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one could imagine hearing

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a life expectancy of just a few months.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:03.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
That had to have been difficult to hear.

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:08.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
How were you able to get your mind
wrapped around that?

00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:14.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you can imagine, 
after many intense and tearful prayers

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking Jehovah to give us peace of mind

00:01:17.358 --> 00:01:22.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to give us a calm heart and wisdom
to make a good decision,

00:01:22.364 --> 00:01:26.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided on a treatment of hospice care

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow me
to make the most of the time that I had left

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:34.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be able to give
my very best to Jehovah.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s remarkable, Felix.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Mayra, you’re such a supportive wife.

00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:43.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have you been able to be so positive?

00:01:43.138 --> 00:01:46.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have to say that it is my hope in Jehovah.

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is what has helped me.

00:01:48.352 --> 00:01:50.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the moment,
we are ‘sharing in the sufferings’

00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:53.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at 2 Corinthians 1:7.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the verse concludes 
that ‘we will also share in the comfort,’

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:00.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are also experiencing that right now.

00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:04.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that I’ll see Felix again
in the resurrection.

00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:06.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I look to the future,

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:10.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can vividly picture
us walking through the Paradise earth,

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoying Jehovah’s beautiful creation.

00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:16.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the life, “the real life,” 
that Jehovah promises.

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:20.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s this hope
that gives me joy and peace.

00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:22.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautifully expressed.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:23.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Felix, how have you
been able to be so joyful?

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:32.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relationship with Jehovah
has never been stronger than it is right now.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:37.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I believe that it’s this closeness
and this intimacy with him

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:41.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is providing me
the joy that I’m experiencing.

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:44.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Philippians 4:6, 7

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:48.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
assures me that “by prayer
and [by] supplication,”

00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:52.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that “the peace of God . . .
will guard your hearts.”

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:55.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer has been so indispensable

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
in bringing me peace during this process,

00:02:57.973 --> 00:03:01.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s also amplified my appreciation
for the resurrection

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:04.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I’ve never experienced before.

00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:07.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 12:25, I think,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
perfectly illustrates our current situation.

00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:15.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says:
“Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:19.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a good word
[it says that it] cheers it up.”

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:23.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both Mayra and I have benefited

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:27.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what we feel is an enormous storehouse

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
of good words received in the way of concern,

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
of love and compassion, from the brotherhood.

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:37.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last, my current circumstances

00:03:37.143 --> 00:03:40.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
have opened up such a wonderful opportunity

00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share Kingdom truths with family members,

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:47.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the beautiful privilege
of being able to study the Bible

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:50.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my mother during the past few months.

00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:52.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:55.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell us, how has this experience

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:57.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected your faith and trust in Jehovah?

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have seen Jehovah’s hand
from the very beginning,

00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:04.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
but one time sticks out in my mind.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the day we received Felix’s prognosis.

00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:10.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
That evening,
the Bethel family <i>Watchtower</i>  Study

00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:15.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
considered the article
“Keep Calm and Trust in Jehovah,”

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:17.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this was followed by a lecture

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:21.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Remain
in Jehovah’s Everlasting Arms.”

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided us
exactly what we needed to hear

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:27.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that very day.

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:30.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt it was an answer to our prayers,

00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:34.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if to reassure us
that he has everything under control.

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:37.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has strengthened my faith
in that Jehovah will continue

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “more than superabundantly”
provide for us care and guidance

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we face new challenges

00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:48.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will without a doubt
fulfill his promises for the future.

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think when you come to understand
that you only have a short time to live,

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:59.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, that’s something that can
very easily knock you right off of your feet.

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:03.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know that we have been grasped

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:05.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Jehovah’s caring hands right now,

00:05:05.493 --> 00:05:09.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is what’s stabilized us.

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:13.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, throughout this ordeal,
we have seen Jehovah’s love

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his care and assistance—

00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:19.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
in every decision, in every step,
that we’ve taken.

00:05:19.092 --> 00:05:22.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the first visits to the doctors,
through surgery,

00:05:22.763 --> 00:05:25.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
and into the most difficult part
of the prognosis,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have lacked nothing.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:31.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
I absolutely know that my faith

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
has only been strengthened
by the challenges of this trial.

00:05:36.153 --> 00:05:39.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now as I prepare to close my eyes

00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:43.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fall asleep for just a brief time,

00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:47.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a privilege for me
to demonstrate to Jehovah my trust

00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:49.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of his promises

00:05:49.418 --> 00:05:53.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to maintain complete integrity
right down to the end.

00:05:55.717 --> 00:05:57.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an outstanding expression of faith!

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you both so much for sharing

00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:04.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
those deeply personal
and motivating expressions.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are a living example of faith in action,

00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:09.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love you.

00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:15.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen that,
and it’s so moving each time.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
On June 8, 2021,
our dear brother Felix went to sleep in death,

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:23.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
just seven weeks after this interview. 

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:27.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And any, frankly, that were
around the Terrazas during this time

00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:29.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
would see firsthand

00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:32.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
the power of faith

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their focus on wanting to give
Jehovah their absolute best.

00:06:36.347 --> 00:06:37.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was tremendous!

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mayra, dear Mayra, continues to show

00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:43.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
that same faith and endurance even now.

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Felix’s mother

00:06:45.023 --> 00:06:48.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
—she has continued to progress spiritually,
we understand.

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Felix will be so happy to hear that.
