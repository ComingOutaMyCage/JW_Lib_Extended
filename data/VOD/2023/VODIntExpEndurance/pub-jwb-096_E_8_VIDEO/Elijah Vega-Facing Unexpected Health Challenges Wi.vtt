00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we continue to be faithful
in spite of our human weaknesses?

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up I had, like,
absolutely no health problems at all.

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I loved playing basketball, and I enjoyed

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:18.747 line:10% position:50% align:center
my life in the congregation.

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:20.082 line:10% position:50% align:center
This was a kid who had

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.500 line:10% position:50% align:center
his whole life in front of him.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was taken away in a moment.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.926 line:10% position:50% align:center
In November of 2019, I was diagnosed

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:32.970 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a massive brain tumor.

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was saying, like: “Why me?

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I do something wrong?”

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to know why it had to happen now

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 16.

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m close to 18

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I think is, like, the prime of my life.

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
The night before I was going to have surgery

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
was probably one of the scariest nights
of my life.

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I wanted to be able
to still do the things that I loved,

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I really just didn’t want my life to end.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account of David

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
was one that was very prominent in my mind.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:16.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many times in his life
when he had to fight foes

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were very scary and life-threatening,

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this situation I was dealing with
was pretty scary and life-threatening,

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I knew Jehovah had my back.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about getting
the brothers from HLC there to talk

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:34.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to back us up
with the alternatives on his card.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctor was impressed

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he asked Elijah if he had any questions,

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:43.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Elijah asked him a couple of questions
about the procedure

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then also brought up the blood issue.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
This showed the doctor

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this was a young man
who had his own stand, his own convictions.

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:55.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah tells me that blood is sacred,

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
then I’m listening.

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:00.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah kept on reminding us

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:04.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even if he doesn’t wake up
on this surgery bed,

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what happens,
he’s still going to wake up,

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s now
or in the future in Paradise.

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
They finally came out

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
only to tell us
that there was a complication.

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah fell into a coma,

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:31.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were waiting on answers
that the doctors weren’t able to give us.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was roughly close to five months

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was in a coma.

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah kept providing

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
the friends, the support.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
We kept getting texts telling us

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:52.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
just how many friends
were praying for Elijah

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:55.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for all of us to get through this.

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the spring of 2020

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when I gradually began to wake up.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s way harder to move around as I used to

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
—super painful and hard.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have ataxia as of right now
temporarily in my right hand,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I’m not able to perform certain activities

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:21.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as I would like to.

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:27.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my heart, I love basketball

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wish I could participate,

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
but knowing I can’t because of something
I can’t control physically

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really hard on me.

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job was always
a great example in the Bible to me.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
I view him in a totally different light now

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was also hit with a medical issue,

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he managed to maintain his faith,

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah eventually blessed Job for that.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:59.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the coma,
Elijah’s zeal definitely hasn’t lessened.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
If anything, it’s increased.

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:04.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives a whole new meaning
to widening out,

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:06.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we want to be as zealous

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as busy in the ministry as he is.

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah has not accomplished any of this
in his own strength.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
He very quickly will give credit to Jehovah

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also will give credit to his family
for the amount of support that he’s received

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give credit to the brothers and sisters

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:24.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the support he’s received
from them as well.

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s been engaged in the field ministry,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s been active
in doing whatever assignments we give him

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:30.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the congregation.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:33.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to appoint him
as a ministerial servant.

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s got all this support.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that Jehovah is with him

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:39.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that in that sense
Jehovah truly is at his right hand.

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that we have a hope

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:45.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given us for the future
of perfect life.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me a goal and more of a motivation

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:52.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help everyone reach that goal
and get there.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s light at the end of the tunnel,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I thank Jehovah for that so much.
