00:00:01 So how can we continue to be faithful in spite of our human weaknesses?
00:00:06 Growing up I had, like, absolutely no health problems at all.
00:00:11 And I loved playing basketball, and I enjoyed
00:00:14 my life in the congregation.
00:00:18 This was a kid who had
00:00:20 his whole life in front of him.
00:00:22 It was taken away in a moment.
00:00:28 In November of 2019, I was diagnosed
00:00:30 with a massive brain tumor.
00:00:34 I was saying, like: “Why me?
00:00:36 Did I do something wrong?”
00:00:38 I wanted to know why it had to happen now
00:00:42 at 16.
00:00:44 I’m close to 18
00:00:47 when I think is, like, the prime of my life.
00:00:52 The night before I was going to have surgery
00:00:55 was probably one of the scariest nights of my life.
00:00:57 So I wanted to be able to still do the things that I loved,
00:01:01 and I really just didn’t want my life to end.
00:01:06 The account of David
00:01:08 was one that was very prominent in my mind.
00:01:12 There were many times in his life when he had to fight foes
00:01:16 that were very scary and life-threatening,
00:01:19 and this situation I was dealing with was pretty scary and life-threatening,
00:01:24 but I knew Jehovah had my back.
00:01:28 We talked about getting the brothers from HLC there to talk
00:01:31 and to back us up with the alternatives on his card.
00:01:34 The doctor was impressed
00:01:36 when he asked Elijah if he had any questions,
00:01:40 and Elijah asked him a couple of questions about the procedure
00:01:43 and then also brought up the blood issue.
00:01:45 This showed the doctor
00:01:47 that this was a young man who had his own stand, his own convictions.
00:01:51 If Jehovah tells me that blood is sacred,
00:01:55 then I’m listening.
00:01:58 Elijah kept on reminding us
00:02:00 that even if he doesn’t wake up on this surgery bed,
00:02:04 no matter what happens, he’s still going to wake up,
00:02:06 whether it’s now or in the future in Paradise.
00:02:15 They finally came out
00:02:18 only to tell us that there was a complication.
00:02:23 Elijah fell into a coma,
00:02:26 and we were waiting on answers that the doctors weren’t able to give us.
00:02:32 It was roughly close to five months
00:02:36 that he was in a coma.
00:02:38 However, Jehovah kept providing
00:02:42 the friends, the support.
00:02:45 We kept getting texts telling us
00:02:47 just how many friends were praying for Elijah
00:02:52 and for all of us to get through this.
00:02:58 In the spring of 2020
00:03:00 is when I gradually began to wake up.
00:03:03 It’s way harder to move around as I used to
00:03:08 —super painful and hard.
00:03:11 I have ataxia as of right now temporarily in my right hand,
00:03:15 so I’m not able to perform certain activities
00:03:19 as well as I would like to.
00:03:25 In my heart, I love basketball
00:03:27 and I wish I could participate,
00:03:30 but knowing I can’t because of something I can’t control physically
00:03:35 is really hard on me.
00:03:39 Job was always a great example in the Bible to me.
00:03:42 I view him in a totally different light now
00:03:45 because he was also hit with a medical issue,
00:03:49 but he managed to maintain his faith,
00:03:52 and Jehovah eventually blessed Job for that.
00:03:56 Since the coma, Elijah’s zeal definitely hasn’t lessened.
00:03:59 If anything, it’s increased.
00:04:01 He gives a whole new meaning to widening out,
00:04:04 because we want to be as zealous
00:04:06 and as busy in the ministry as he is.
00:04:09 Elijah has not accomplished any of this in his own strength.
00:04:13 He very quickly will give credit to Jehovah
00:04:16 but also will give credit to his family for the amount of support that he’s received
00:04:20 and give credit to the brothers and sisters
00:04:22 for the support he’s received from them as well.
00:04:24 He’s been engaged in the field ministry,
00:04:26 and he’s been active in doing whatever assignments we give him
00:04:28 within the congregation.
00:04:30 We were able to appoint him as a ministerial servant.
00:04:33 He’s got all this support.
00:04:34 He knows that Jehovah is with him
00:04:36 and that in that sense Jehovah truly is at his right hand.
00:04:39 I know that we have a hope
00:04:41 that Jehovah has given us for the future of perfect life.
00:04:45 It gives me a goal and more of a motivation
00:04:48 to help everyone reach that goal and get there.
00:04:52 There’s light at the end of the tunnel,
00:04:54 so I thank Jehovah for that so much.
