00:00:04 Before I go to work or go witnessing,
00:00:07 I wake up, grab a coffee,
00:00:09 sit in my chair, and I check jw.org.
00:00:15 I think it’s important because it helps us to keep informed
00:00:18 with what our brothers are going through.
00:00:23 When I read about my brothers and sisters facing trials,
00:00:27 I just feel I want to do something
00:00:29 to help these brothers and sisters.
00:00:35 When Jehovah’s Witnesses were banned in Russia,
00:00:37 a lot of negative, false, and questionable information about us
00:00:42 began to appear in the media.
00:00:44 It was all so unreal. It was hard to believe.
00:00:51 When the apostle Paul was facing a trial, he was asking the brothers
00:00:56 to ‘exert themselves in prayer to God for me.’
00:01:01 For our brothers going through jail
00:01:04 or through natural disasters,
00:01:06 they need all the support and help
00:01:10 that they can get.
00:01:12 We’re so close to the end;
00:01:14 we want our children to understand what we might face.
00:01:17 We’ve done the videos on praying for others,
00:01:20 and the brothers have given us good worksheets.
00:01:25 For family worship, we did some worksheets.
00:01:29 They might not know
00:01:30 that we are praying for them,
00:01:31 but Jehovah feels happy when I pray for them.
00:01:35 They have courage, and I want to be like them too.
00:01:39 As a mother, I think it’s really important
00:01:42 for our children to know what’s going on
00:01:44 with others’ trials.
00:01:46 And if they can stop and really feel for those brothers
00:01:49 and then offer a prayer,
00:01:51 they’re taking part in them being faithful.
00:01:56 It’s always encouraging
00:01:59 to pray for others
00:02:00 because you’re actually building
00:02:02 your relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:07 When you stop and consider what others are going through
00:02:10 and how they’re being faithful, that’s really built my faith,
00:02:14 and then I want to imitate their faith.
00:02:20 I was involved in a car accident,
00:02:23 and that impacted my life.
00:02:28 I have pain every day.
00:02:32 I was feeling lonely and depressed.
00:02:37 And while I was scrolling through the website,
00:02:40 I came across the Newsroom,
00:02:42 and I read about our brothers and sisters
00:02:45 —the things that they were going through, the challenges they were facing.
00:02:49 If they didn’t give up going through all those difficult times,
00:02:53 then I don’t have to give up either.
00:02:57 My sequence of prayer now is to pray for others first
00:03:01 and then for myself last.
00:03:04 When we pray for others, it helps us
00:03:06 to build our faith in Jehovah and trust in him
00:03:10 because we know that he has helped our brothers and sisters
00:03:12 and he will also help us.
00:03:17 When the persecution in Russia began to grow,
00:03:21 a sense of uncertainty arose
00:03:24 about what was happening.
00:03:29 When we saw the news on jw.org,
00:03:34 we realized that our brothers all over the world
00:03:37 knew about the situation in Russia.
00:03:40 Although we did not hear how brothers from other countries were praying for us,
00:03:45 we knew that they were doing it and cared about us.
00:03:51 The knowledge that the brothers were praying for us
00:03:54 really strengthened us.
00:03:56 I knew that everything was under control.
00:04:03 When you know the problems that a brother or sister is facing,
00:04:06 then our prayers are more sincere
00:04:09 and they truly come from the heart.
00:04:13 I must use every opportunity.
00:04:16 I must not let up to pray for my brothers and sisters.
00:04:21 When we pray
00:04:23 and it’s for his name, Jehovah answers our prayers.
