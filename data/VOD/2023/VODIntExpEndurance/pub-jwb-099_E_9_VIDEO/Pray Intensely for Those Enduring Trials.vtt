00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:07.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I go to work or go witnessing,

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wake up, grab a coffee,

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
sit in my chair, and I check jw.org.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:18.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s important
because it helps us to keep informed

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:22.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
with what our brothers are going through.

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read about my brothers and sisters
facing trials,

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:29.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just feel I want to do something

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help these brothers and sisters.

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah’s Witnesses
were banned in Russia,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of negative, false,
and questionable information about us

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
began to appear in the media.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was all so unreal.
It was hard to believe.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul was facing a trial,
he was asking the brothers

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘exert themselves
in prayer to God for me.’

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.084 line:10% position:50% align:center
For our brothers going through jail

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.378 line:10% position:50% align:center
or through natural disasters,

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:10.007 line:10% position:50% align:center
they need all the support and help

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they can get.

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so close to the end;

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want our children to understand
what we might face.

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve done the videos on praying for others,

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the brothers have given us
good worksheets.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
For family worship, we did some worksheets.

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:30.903 line:10% position:50% align:center
They might not know

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:31.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we are praying for them,

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.698 line:10% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah feels happy when I pray for them.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have courage,
and I want to be like them too.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:42.164 line:10% position:50% align:center
As a mother, I think it’s really important

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:44.416 line:10% position:50% align:center
for our children to know what’s going on

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.293 line:10% position:50% align:center
with others’ trials.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:49.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if they can stop
and really feel for those brothers

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:51.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then offer a prayer,

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:54.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re taking part in them being faithful.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always encouraging

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.516 line:10% position:50% align:center
to pray for others

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.810 line:10% position:50% align:center
because you’re actually building

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.646 line:10% position:50% align:center
your relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you stop and consider
what others are going through

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:14.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they’re being faithful,
that’s really built my faith,

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I want to imitate their faith.

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was involved in a car accident,

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that impacted my life.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have pain every day.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was feeling lonely and depressed.

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.347 line:10% position:50% align:center
And while I was scrolling through the website,

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:42.391 line:10% position:50% align:center
I came across the Newsroom,

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.561 line:10% position:50% align:center
and I read about our brothers and sisters

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the things that they were going through,
the challenges they were facing.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they didn’t give up
going through all those difficult times,

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
then I don’t have to give up either.

00:02:57.573 --> 00:03:01.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
My sequence of prayer now
is to pray for others first

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then for myself last.

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:06.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we pray for others, it helps us

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:10.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build our faith in Jehovah
and trust in him

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know that he has helped
our brothers and sisters

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will also help us.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:21.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the persecution in Russia began to grow,

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:24.892 line:10% position:50% align:center
a sense of uncertainty arose

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:26.643 line:10% position:50% align:center
about what was happening.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:34.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we saw the news on jw.org,

00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realized
that our brothers all over the world

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:39.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
knew about the situation in Russia.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we did not hear how brothers
from other countries were praying for us,

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
we knew that they were doing it
and cared about us.

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:54.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
The knowledge that the brothers
were praying for us

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
really strengthened us.

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that everything was under control.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you know the problems
that a brother or sister is facing,

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
then our prayers are more sincere

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:11.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they truly come from the heart.

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:16.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
I must use every opportunity.

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:20.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
I must not let up
to pray for my brothers and sisters.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we pray

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s for his name,
Jehovah answers our prayers.
