00:00:01.731 --> 00:00:05.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
I served as an elder until the end of 2014.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when some problems came up,
and I ended up being disqualified.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already been serving as an elder
for nearly two years.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the time,

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:21.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that the best thing to do

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:24.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be to stop
and give up my privilege of service

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I could care for myself emotionally.

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:34.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I lost my privileges,
my qualifications were reviewed by the elders

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
on three separate occasions,

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:40.653 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that ended up dampening my desire

00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:42.656 line:10% position:50% align:center
to want to serve again in the future.

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:44.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began thinking:

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A publisher receives
the same reward as an elder.

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:51.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why should I put myself
through that all over again?’

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:54.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you resign or are disqualified

00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:56.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
from serving as an elder,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.009 line:10% position:50% align:center
you’re not immune

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.971 line:10% position:50% align:center
to feeling like you’re a failure,

00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:03.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
feeling sad,

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:08.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially feeling
that you’ve let Jehovah down.

00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a fight to remain active.

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:17.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the biggest things that helped me
during that phase was my wife’s support.

00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:22.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
She believed in me and helped motivate me.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife was already a pioneer,

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:26.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she encouraged me
to start pioneering too.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
So within just a few months,

00:01:28.753 --> 00:01:30.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already started serving as a pioneer.

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:35.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was in the ministry
that I began to cultivate a desire

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve once again as an elder.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Getting involved
in activities with the congregation,

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping out with the cleaning . . .

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being with my wife in the preaching work,

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
conducting Bible studies . . .

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:56.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a lot of help from the brothers

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cried with me when I needed to cry

00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:05.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who laughed with me
when it was possible to laugh.

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:07.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
A mature elder helped me to see

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:10.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I needed to leave the matter
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:13.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
That time period
when I stopped serving as an elder,

00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:18.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that that may have been
when I prayed the most in all my life.

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:21.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still wasn’t an elder, but I felt at peace.

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:24.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remembered 1 John 3:20,

00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:26.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “[Jehovah] is greater than our hearts”

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he knew what I was going through.

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:34.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just because
I wasn’t serving any longer as an elder,

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:36.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
that didn’t make Jehovah love me any less.

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:38.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me a lot.

00:02:39.297 --> 00:02:41.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most difficult thing to overcome

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:44.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really the resentment
that I felt toward some brothers

00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had participated in the whole process.

00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture at Psalm 119:165

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to see that when you’re going
through a difficult situation,

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s the time that you need to show
that you love Jehovah.

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:02.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could see that during that time of my life,

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:05.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when I had to show
that I really loved Jehovah.

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would pray to Jehovah each and every day,

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would mention those brothers by name.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me to start softening my heart,

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:18.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lessen and eventually
to eliminate this resentment.

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting in Jehovah

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:28.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
was so worth it,

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:32.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I felt like it was
a great act of love on his part

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
to allow me once again to serve as an elder.

00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:38.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s as if he told me,

00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:42.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Marcelo, I trust that you are going
to do a good job as an elder.’

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just have to trust in Jehovah.

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I began to show more trust,

00:03:47.797 --> 00:03:51.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when things started happening
in a way that I couldn’t have imagined.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
In less than two years,

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:55.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already begun serving
as an elder again.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 2016, we received
an invitation to serve at Bethel.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife and I
have now been serving here at Bethel

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:10.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a little more than ten years.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you accept the discipline,

00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:16.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you stop thinking about privileges

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start thinking more about the brothers

00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:22.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about being more involved
in the ministry.

00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:26.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still had the most important privilege:

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:30.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
