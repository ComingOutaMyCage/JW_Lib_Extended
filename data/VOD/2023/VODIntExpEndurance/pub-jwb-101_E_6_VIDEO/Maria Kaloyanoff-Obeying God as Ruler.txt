00:00:02 So my mother was born in the country of Bulgaria in 1922,
00:00:07 and in the early 1950’s,
00:00:10 my family emigrated from Germany to the United States.
00:00:14 We settled in New York City,
00:00:16 and it was there that my mother
00:00:18 learned the truth.
00:00:19 That is the first time I opened a Bible.
00:00:23 I went and opened Revelation chapter 21.
00:00:28 But what hit me was the point
00:00:31 that there will not be sickness,
00:00:33 sorrow, and death anymore.
00:00:37 Anyone that comes into the truth
00:00:40 wants to share that with their family.
00:00:42 I had a desire,
00:00:45 really, to tell them the truth,
00:00:48 how they can get free
00:00:51 from oppression and sickness and death.
00:00:57 So she very much saw the need and desired
00:01:00 to have literature in the Bulgarian language.
00:01:04 She was able to ask the brothers in Brooklyn,
00:01:07 specifically offering if she could
00:01:10 translate some literature into Bulgarian.
00:01:13 The brothers approved for her to do that,
00:01:16 starting out with some of the tracts.
00:01:21 So Bulgaria was behind the Iron Curtain, a Communist country.
00:01:25 Literature about God and the Bible
00:01:28 is not acceptable and banned,
00:01:32 so you can’t just mail it.
00:01:34 So as literature became available, people have to take it in.
00:01:39 My family was one of those families that volunteered to do that.
00:01:44 We traveled into Bulgaria by train.
00:01:47 We had a lot of luggage because every time we would go to Bulgaria,
00:01:52 we stayed two and a half months.
00:01:54 That was the summer vacation.
00:01:56 In that luggage, in various places,
00:02:02 we put literature.
00:02:04 Traveling into a country with banned literature
00:02:09 is not without its problems or dangers.
00:02:13 They knew that we had some literature, and that was the tracts.
00:02:18 My mother realized that we were going to be searched.
00:02:23 We had the ability
00:02:26 to take the literature out of each luggage that we had hidden it in
00:02:31 and to put it into one small briefcase.
00:02:35 And what we couldn’t,
00:02:37 like unfolded tracts,
00:02:39 we put around our arm
00:02:42 with our overcoats over it.
00:02:45 I was only worrying about how I can
00:02:48 hide that literature so he cannot find it.
00:02:52 Because if he finds it,
00:02:55 then there really are consequences.
00:02:58 So as the guards would search through the luggage,
00:03:01 they would rifle through it.
00:03:02 They didn’t straighten anything out,
00:03:04 so my mother quickly thought and asked them,
00:03:07 “Can I now go over there and straighten out
00:03:09 what you’ve messed up?”
00:03:12 And they said, “OK.”
00:03:14 I took my tracts,
00:03:18 which I had around my hand,
00:03:20 and I put them in the already checked bag over there.
00:03:26 One of the guards gets to the point that it’s my little briefcase.
00:03:32 He says,
00:03:34 “This is so small;
00:03:36 nothing could be in here!”
00:03:38 And he just takes it over there.
00:03:42 The man who was looking was getting very nervous
00:03:46 because he knew we had something,
00:03:48 but he was not able to find it.
00:03:54 So in one trip years later, my mother was on her own.
00:03:59 The officials at the border of Bulgaria found literature.
00:04:03 They arrested her.
00:04:05 They put her in prison.
00:04:08 They interrogated her for two weeks or more every day.
00:04:14 And in time, the Bulgarian government changed their mind
00:04:19 and decided that as a foreign national,
00:04:22 they would just expel her from the country.
00:04:27 To this day, my mother continues her spiritual routine
00:04:30 of worshipping Jehovah
00:04:33 —being at the meetings, preparing for the meetings, reading her Bible,
00:04:37 and zealously sharing the truth with others.
00:04:41 It helps me practically
00:04:44 every minute in my life.
00:04:47 And I want to use my last bit of energy
00:04:53 to make his will known.
