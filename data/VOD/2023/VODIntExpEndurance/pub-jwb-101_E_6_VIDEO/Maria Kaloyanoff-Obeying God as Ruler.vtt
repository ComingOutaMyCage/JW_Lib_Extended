00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mother was born
in the country of Bulgaria in 1922,

00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:10.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the early 1950’s,

00:00:10.074 --> 00:00:14.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
my family emigrated
from Germany to the United States.

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:16.518 line:10% position:50% align:center
We settled in New York City,

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.416 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it was there that my mother

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:19.835 line:10% position:50% align:center
learned the truth.

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:23.130 line:10% position:50% align:center
That is the first time I opened a Bible.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went and opened Revelation chapter 21.

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:31.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what hit me was the point

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:33.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there will not be sickness,

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:37.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
sorrow, and death anymore.

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:40.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone that comes into the truth

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:42.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
wants to share that with their family.

00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:45.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a desire,

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:48.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
really, to tell them the truth,

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:51.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they can get free

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
from oppression and sickness and death.

00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:00.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she very much saw the need and desired

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:03.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have literature in the Bulgarian language.

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:07.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was able to ask the brothers in Brooklyn,

00:01:07.493 --> 00:01:10.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifically offering if she could

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:13.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
translate some literature into Bulgarian.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers approved for her to do that,

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:19.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting out with some of the tracts.

00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:25.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Bulgaria was behind the Iron Curtain,
a Communist country.

00:01:25.764 --> 00:01:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Literature about God and the Bible

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:32.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not acceptable and banned,

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:34.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
so you can’t just mail it.

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:39.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as literature became available,
people have to take it in.

00:01:39.947 --> 00:01:44.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family was one of those families
that volunteered to do that.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
We traveled into Bulgaria by train.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:52.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a lot of luggage because every time
we would go to Bulgaria,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:54.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
we stayed two and a half months.

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:56.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the summer vacation.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that luggage, in various places,

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put literature.

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:09.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling into a country
with banned literature

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:13.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not without its problems or dangers.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that we had some literature,
and that was the tracts.

00:02:18.408 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother realized
that we were going to be searched.

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:26.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had the ability

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:31.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the literature
out of each luggage that we had hidden it in

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:35.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to put it into one small briefcase.

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what we couldn’t,

00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:39.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
like unfolded tracts,

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:42.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put around our arm

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:45.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our overcoats over it.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was only worrying about how I can

00:02:48.505 --> 00:02:52.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
hide that literature so he cannot find it.

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:55.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if he finds it,

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:58.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
then there really are consequences.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the guards would search
through the luggage,

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would rifle through it.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t straighten anything out,

00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:07.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
so my mother quickly thought and asked them,

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can I now go over there and straighten out

00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:12.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you’ve messed up?”

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they said, “OK.”

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took my tracts,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
which I had around my hand,

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:25.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I put them in the already
checked bag over there.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:30.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the guards gets to the point
that it’s my little briefcase.

00:03:32.492 --> 00:03:34.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says,

00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:36.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is so small;

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
nothing could be in here!”

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he just takes it over there.

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:46.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man who was looking
was getting very nervous

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he knew we had something,

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:51.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was not able to find it.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:58.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in one trip years later,
my mother was on her own.

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:03.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
The officials at the border
of Bulgaria found literature.

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
They arrested her.

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put her in prison.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:13.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
They interrogated her for two weeks
or more every day.

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:19.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in time,
the Bulgarian government changed their mind

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:22.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided that as a foreign national,

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would just expel her from the country.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
To this day,
my mother continues her spiritual routine

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:33.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
of worshipping Jehovah

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:37.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being at the meetings, preparing
for the meetings, reading her Bible,

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:41.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and zealously sharing the truth with others.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps me practically

00:04:44.846 --> 00:04:47.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
every minute in my life.

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:52.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I want to use my last bit of energy

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:56.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make his will known.
