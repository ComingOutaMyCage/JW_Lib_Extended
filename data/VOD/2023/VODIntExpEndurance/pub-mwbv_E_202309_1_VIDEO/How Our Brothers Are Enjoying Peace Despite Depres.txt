00:00:03 My mom has always told me
00:00:05 that I’ve always been
00:00:08 a caregiver ever since I was a little girl;
00:00:11 it was just part of who I was.
00:00:14 I don’t like to see people suffer;
00:00:16 it’s very difficult for me.
00:00:21 I remember that when I first started working as a nurse,
00:00:27 I would always cry.
00:00:29 I cried—
00:00:31 Literally I cried every day that I had to go to work.
00:00:37 Not only was I overwhelmed being a new nurse
00:00:41 but also
00:00:43 I was battling my depression.
00:00:49 I was feeling so sad.
00:00:51 I really needed Jehovah’s help to figure out what was going on with me.
00:00:55 And I remember
00:00:57 that the 2009 article about depression came out.
00:01:04 And I realized: ‘OK, Jehovah, you’re telling me
00:01:06 ‘this is what I have.
00:01:08 ‘So now that I realize I have this,
00:01:11 I’ve got to figure out how I can manage it.’
00:01:15 So I changed my eating habits.
00:01:17 I started exercising a lot more.
00:01:19 I realized that exercising and eating healthy really, really did help.
00:01:25 Also, I made a journal.
00:01:29 And I made different sections
00:01:32 of the different aspects of my depression that I dealt with.
00:01:36 In each section, I would put scriptures;
00:01:39 I would put articles.
00:01:41 And the illustrations, the pictures,
00:01:43 they speak a lot without saying anything.
00:01:49 Jehovah hears us.
00:01:52 Jehovah cares.
00:02:00 Exercising, changing my diet,
00:02:03 the publications, journaling
00:02:06 —that was my lifeline.
00:02:07 That really actually helped me for a long time.
00:02:11 But it came to a point where it
00:02:13 stopped working as effectively.
00:02:16 I remember getting ready, dressing for the meeting,
00:02:19 and I was fine.
00:02:22 I was getting dressed for the meeting, about to walk out the door, but I couldn’t.
00:02:26 There was this overwhelming fear that came over me
00:02:29 and an overwhelming sadness that came over me.
00:02:32 And I just lost it; I just started crying.
00:02:36 I couldn’t get myself together.
00:02:39 It was bad.
00:02:41 It got really bad; my depression got really bad.
00:02:48 So it was very difficult for me to approach the brothers to ask them for help.
00:02:53 But at that time, I knew that if I didn’t,
00:02:57 that something bad would happen.
00:03:04 So I decided: ‘You know what?
00:03:06 I’m going to ask for a shepherding call with my brothers,’
00:03:08 because I’d never talked about my depression with the elders at all.
00:03:11 This was my first time speaking with them.
00:03:15 And there was one brother, one of the elders,
00:03:18 who also battled depression.
00:03:20 And he suggested,
00:03:23 “Have you thought about seeking medical help?”
00:03:29 Seeking professional help was something I never wanted to do.
00:03:33 I thought that I didn’t need to do it,
00:03:35 but sometimes there comes a point
00:03:38 where you need additional help
00:03:44 and what you’re doing is not enough.
00:03:47 In this world, they make you feel that it’s a bad thing,
00:03:51 that depression is a dirty word,
00:03:53 or that seeking medical help is something that you don’t do.
00:03:56 But I realized also that seeking medical help
00:04:01 was part of my being able to worship Jehovah effectively.
00:04:05 That’s me doing my part.
00:04:07 Not everyone needs to take that step, but for me, this is what I need to do.
00:04:11 And I’m glad I did it because of the fact
00:04:14 that I’ve never ever felt this good
00:04:18 in my life.
00:04:22 At first, it started with one floor,
00:04:25 then it went to another floor,
00:04:26 and then the whole entire hospital.
00:04:29 Every floor had COVID patients.
00:04:34 That was some of the hardest nursing
00:04:37 that I’ve ever done in my life
00:04:39 in all of my years of nursing.
00:04:42 And we lost a lot of good nurses
00:04:46 who were right in the trenches with me
00:04:48 who were in there doing their best.
00:04:51 We lost a lot of good people.
00:04:53 Even though I was on medication to help me,
00:04:57 it still didn’t take the depression away.
00:04:59 You’re like: ‘What’s the point?
00:05:01 ‘I can’t save anyone.
00:05:03 I can’t, I can’t help anyone.’
00:05:06 It was devastating.
00:05:08 It truly, truly was devastating.
00:05:13 And at those times I just cry to Jehovah,
00:05:20 talk to Jehovah about how I’m feeling,
00:05:24 and just ask for his peace to help me to deal.
00:05:30 When I’m able to help people who are battling depression,
00:05:33 I feel like Jehovah is using me in that way,
00:05:36 and it makes me happy that I can be of use to Jehovah.
00:05:39 It’s good to feel—
00:05:41 It’s so nice to feel good again,
00:05:44 to feel happy again, to be able to smile,
00:05:47 to be able to take in enjoyment in the small things,
00:05:50 you know, in Jehovah’s creation
00:05:53 —and, you know, just be happy that I’m alive.
00:05:57 So yeah,
00:06:01 yeah.
