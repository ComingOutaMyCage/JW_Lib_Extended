00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:05.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom has always told me

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve always been

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:11.156 line:10% position:50% align:center
a caregiver ever since I was a little girl;

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:14.702 line:10% position:50% align:center
it was just part of who I was.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:16.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t like to see people suffer;

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very difficult for me.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember
that when I first started working as a nurse,

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would always cry.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cried—

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Literally I cried every day
that I had to go to work.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only was I overwhelmed
being a new nurse

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was battling my depression.

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was feeling so sad.

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really needed Jehovah’s help
to figure out what was going on with me.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remember

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the 2009 article
about depression came out.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized:
‘OK, Jehovah, you’re telling me

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘this is what I have.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So now that I realize I have this,

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to figure out how I can manage it.’

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I changed my eating habits.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started exercising a lot more.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:23.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that exercising
and eating healthy really, really did help.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, I made a journal.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I made different sections

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the different aspects of my depression
that I dealt with.

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each section, I would put scriptures;

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would put articles.

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the illustrations, the pictures,

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
they speak a lot without saying anything.

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hears us.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cares.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exercising, changing my diet,

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
the publications, journaling

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that was my lifeline.

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really actually helped me
for a long time.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it came to a point where it 

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
stopped working as effectively.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember getting ready,
dressing for the meeting,

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was fine.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was getting dressed for the meeting,
about to walk out the door, but I couldn’t.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was this overwhelming fear
that came over me

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an overwhelming sadness
that came over me.

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just lost it; I just started crying.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t get myself together.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was bad.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got really bad;
my depression got really bad.

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was very difficult for me to approach
the brothers to ask them for help.

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at that time, I knew that if I didn’t,

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
that something bad would happen.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:06.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided: ‘You know what?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to ask
for a shepherding call with my brothers,’

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’d never talked about my depression
with the elders at all.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was my first time speaking with them.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was one brother, one of the elders,

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
who also battled depression.

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:23.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he suggested,

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you thought about
seeking medical help?”

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeking professional help
was something I never wanted to do.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that I didn’t need to do it,

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes there comes a point

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you need additional help

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what you’re doing is not enough.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world, they make you feel
that it’s a bad thing,

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:53.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
that depression is a dirty word,

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that seeking medical help
is something that you don’t do.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I realized also that seeking medical help

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:05.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
was part of my being able
to worship Jehovah effectively.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s me doing my part.

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:11.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone needs to take that step,
but for me, this is what I need to do.

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:14.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m glad I did it because of the fact

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve never
ever felt this good

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
in my life.

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, it started with one floor,

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it went to another floor,

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:29.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the whole entire hospital.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every floor had COVID patients.

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was some of the hardest nursing

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve ever done in my life

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:42.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of my years of nursing.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:46.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we lost a lot of good nurses

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:48.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were right in the trenches with me

00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were in there doing their best.

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
We lost a lot of good people.

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was on medication to help me,

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
it still didn’t take the depression away.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:01.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re like: ‘What’s the point?

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I can’t save anyone.

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:06.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t, I can’t help anyone.’

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:08.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was devastating.

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:11.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
It truly, truly was devastating.

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:18.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at those times I just cry to Jehovah,

00:05:20.132 --> 00:05:23.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to Jehovah about how I’m feeling,

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just ask for his peace
to help me to deal.

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:33.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m able to help people
who are battling depression,

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:36.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like Jehovah is using me in that way,

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it makes me happy
that I can be of use to Jehovah.

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:41.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to feel—

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so nice to feel good again,

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:47.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel happy again,
to be able to smile,

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:50.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to take in enjoyment
in the small things,

00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:53.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, in Jehovah’s creation

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and, you know, just be happy that I’m alive.

00:05:57.586 --> 00:06:01.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
So yeah,

00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:04.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
yeah.
