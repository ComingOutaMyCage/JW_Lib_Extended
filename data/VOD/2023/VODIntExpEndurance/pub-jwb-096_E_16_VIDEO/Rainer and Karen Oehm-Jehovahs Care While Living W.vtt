00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Karen, you’ve always been known

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.156 line:10% position:50% align:center
for your warm, infectious smile.

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:08.391 line:10% position:50% align:center
Could you tell us what has helped you

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:10.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
to cope with a serious health challenge

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet still maintain
such a positive attitude?

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.533 line:10% position:50% align:center
Surprisingly, I have never cried

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
because of having ALS.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.838 line:10% position:50% align:center
I only break down out of frustration

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:24.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I can’t communicate.

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was first diagnosed,

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I figured it was time
to copy my study Bible notes

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other notes I had been saving

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put them in electronic format.

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:39.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wrote so small that no one could read them.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:44.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took a year,
but reading the Bible and notes built me up.

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the prayers said for us certainly help

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:52.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the boxes of cards
with encouraging words and scriptures.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:56.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have never been without flowers,
which cheer us up.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:59.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve been surrounded by love.

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:02.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we all feel that way.

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no other organization
that would take care of us

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:07.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same way like Jehovah’s organization
and his people do.

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, Karen,
can you tell us a little bit

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
about this device
that you’re using to communicate?

00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:14.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
How exactly does it work?

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:19.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
This computer is a lifesaver

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:21.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it enables me to talk.

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know how much I like to talk.

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:26.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is called an eye gaze

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:29.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I calibrate this to my eyes

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then stare at a keyboard on the screen

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I can type words.

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:38.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also suggests words,
like on your phone,

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I don’t have to type everything out.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:45.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can save responses
that I want to use again.

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might wonder
how it can sound like me.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t save my voice in time,

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
so my sister recorded 50 sentences

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have all the sounds
needed for English.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since we are twins,
we sound the same.

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:05.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow, that’s amazing!

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:07.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing
to be able to have even your sister

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:09.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
help you out with it as well!

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Rainer,
how were you able to obtain this device?

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:15.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you have ALS,

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Lou Gehrig’s, as it is also called,

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:23.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the state of New York
pays for all the equipment.

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
This device,
with the insurance and all the attachments,

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:30.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
goes for up to $18,000.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:34.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s amazing
that the government does this for us!

00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow, what a blessing from Jehovah!

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Karen, how has this helped you
to maintain a regular study of the Bible

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even helped you
with your participation at the meetings?

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can type comments for meetings
ahead of time,

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:53.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I can study on <i>JW Library®</i>

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
and access jw.org.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is much slower,

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:01.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at least I can study and participate.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:05.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rainer, can you tell us
how the friends in the congregation react

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:12.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they hear Karen
comment at the meetings?

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, the congregation is very appreciative,

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:17.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re really encouraged by that,

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:20.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at just about every meeting

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Karen has a comment.

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after she gives her comment,

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:28.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
they say, “Oh, we’re glad it was Karen
and not you, Rainer.”

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’re very happy
to hear Karen and see her.

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:36.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these last couple of questions
are for both of you.

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:39.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we could start with you, Rainer.

00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:42.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have you received strength and support,

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly from your brothers and sisters,
during this trial?

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:50.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you have any specific examples
that you could share with us?

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:53.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the brothers here in the infirmary

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:56.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
are just outstanding.

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:59.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think this would be the first time

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will get through an interview
without getting emotional.

00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are so nice and so helpful.

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
They come in the morning at 8:30.

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:16.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
They ask if Karen is up already,
if she can get up.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:19.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they get her up,
and they get her ready for breakfast.

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:23.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes that goes till 11:00-11:30

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
before she can have breakfast.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:28.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is a lot of work,

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they do such a beautiful job.

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:33.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remarkable!

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure they appreciate
your expressions as well.

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:39.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you, Karen?

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have you appreciated the support
from the brothers and sisters?

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:43.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides what I mentioned,

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
when our congregation heard about me,

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
they wanted to learn how to make my cookies.

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:54.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they took my recipes
and created a gorgeous cookbook

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:57.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave us copies to share.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they arranged baking classes via Zoom.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means so much to me
that a part of me will continue.

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:10.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a real witness
to our unbelieving relatives too.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the cookbook.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know where the camera is, this way.

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s beautiful.

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:19.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at that, <i>Cookies Amore.</i>

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we didn’t even know about it.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister composed it,

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:27.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it has a beautiful display and examples.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s outstanding.

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that’s beautiful to see

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how everyone has rallied
around both of you to support you.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the last question,

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have you seen
Jehovah’s hand in your lives

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you face this challenge?

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we could start with you,
Rainer, please.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a very difficult situation,

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:49.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
because when you’re paralyzed, it’s bad.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you’re paralyzed
and you’re not able to speak,

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:58.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that makes
for a very difficult situation, you know.

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:02.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the help of the brothers
has been outstanding.

00:06:02.812 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love—it’s remarkable.

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you, Karen?

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate now
why the infirmary is always mentioned

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the letters to the Bethel family.

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:22.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ones who take care of us

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot be compared
to others in the same profession.

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
They work with heart.

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:32.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t just a job to them,
but they work with love.

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:34.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
My aunt was on Zoom

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:37.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a PCA kissed me on the forehead
as she left.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
My aunt said, with tears in her eyes,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They love her.”
