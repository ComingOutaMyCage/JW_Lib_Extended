00:00:01 Karen, you’ve always been known
00:00:03 for your warm, infectious smile.
00:00:06 Could you tell us what has helped you
00:00:08 to cope with a serious health challenge
00:00:10 and yet still maintain such a positive attitude?
00:00:14 Surprisingly, I have never cried
00:00:16 because of having ALS.
00:00:19 I only break down out of frustration
00:00:21 when I can’t communicate.
00:00:24 When I was first diagnosed,
00:00:26 I figured it was time to copy my study Bible notes
00:00:30 and other notes I had been saving
00:00:32 and put them in electronic format.
00:00:35 I wrote so small that no one could read them.
00:00:39 It took a year, but reading the Bible and notes built me up.
00:00:44 All the prayers said for us certainly help
00:00:47 and the boxes of cards with encouraging words and scriptures.
00:00:52 We have never been without flowers, which cheer us up.
00:00:56 And we’ve been surrounded by love.
00:01:00 I think we all feel that way.
00:01:02 There’s no other organization that would take care of us
00:01:04 the same way like Jehovah’s organization and his people do.
00:01:07 But, Karen, can you tell us a little bit
00:01:09 about this device that you’re using to communicate?
00:01:12 How exactly does it work?
00:01:16 This computer is a lifesaver
00:01:19 because it enables me to talk.
00:01:21 You know how much I like to talk.
00:01:24 It is called an eye gaze
00:01:26 because I calibrate this to my eyes
00:01:29 and then stare at a keyboard on the screen
00:01:32 and I can type words.
00:01:34 It also suggests words, like on your phone,
00:01:38 so I don’t have to type everything out.
00:01:41 I can save responses that I want to use again.
00:01:45 You might wonder how it can sound like me.
00:01:49 I didn’t save my voice in time,
00:01:51 so my sister recorded 50 sentences
00:01:55 that have all the sounds needed for English.
00:01:58 Since we are twins, we sound the same.
00:02:03 Wow, that’s amazing!
00:02:05 What a blessing to be able to have even your sister
00:02:07 help you out with it as well!
00:02:09 So, Rainer, how were you able to obtain this device?
00:02:13 Well, when you have ALS,
00:02:15 or Lou Gehrig’s, as it is also called,
00:02:18 then the state of New York pays for all the equipment.
00:02:23 This device, with the insurance and all the attachments,
00:02:27 goes for up to $18,000.
00:02:30 So it’s amazing that the government does this for us!
00:02:35 Wow, what a blessing from Jehovah!
00:02:37 So, Karen, how has this helped you to maintain a regular study of the Bible
00:02:42 and even helped you with your participation at the meetings?
00:02:45 I can type comments for meetings ahead of time,
00:02:49 and I can study on JW Library®
00:02:53 and access jw.org.
00:02:56 It is much slower,
00:02:58 but at least I can study and participate.
00:03:04 That’s wonderful.
00:03:05 Rainer, can you tell us how the friends in the congregation react
00:03:08 when they hear Karen comment at the meetings?
00:03:12 Ah, the congregation is very appreciative,
00:03:14 and they’re really encouraged by that,
00:03:17 because at just about every meeting
00:03:20 Karen has a comment.
00:03:22 And after she gives her comment,
00:03:24 they say, “Oh, we’re glad it was Karen and not you, Rainer.”
00:03:28 So they’re very happy to hear Karen and see her.
00:03:33 Very good.
00:03:34 So these last couple of questions are for both of you.
00:03:36 Maybe we could start with you, Rainer.
00:03:39 How have you received strength and support,
00:03:42 particularly from your brothers and sisters, during this trial?
00:03:46 And do you have any specific examples that you could share with us?
00:03:50 Yes, the brothers here in the infirmary
00:03:53 are just outstanding.
00:03:56 And I think this would be the first time
00:03:59 I will get through an interview without getting emotional.
00:04:04 Sorry about that.
00:04:05 They are so nice and so helpful.
00:04:08 They come in the morning at 8:30.
00:04:12 They ask if Karen is up already, if she can get up.
00:04:16 And they get her up, and they get her ready for breakfast.
00:04:19 And sometimes that goes till 11:00-11:30
00:04:23 before she can have breakfast.
00:04:25 So this is a lot of work,
00:04:28 and they do such a beautiful job.
00:04:32 Remarkable!
00:04:33 Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:34 I’m sure they appreciate your expressions as well.
00:04:37 What about you, Karen?
00:04:39 How have you appreciated the support from the brothers and sisters?
00:04:42 Besides what I mentioned,
00:04:43 when our congregation heard about me,
00:04:46 they wanted to learn how to make my cookies.
00:04:50 So they took my recipes and created a gorgeous cookbook
00:04:54 and gave us copies to share.
00:04:57 Then they arranged baking classes via Zoom.
00:05:01 It means so much to me that a part of me will continue.
00:05:05 It was a real witness to our unbelieving relatives too.
00:05:11 Wow!
00:05:12 So here’s the cookbook.
00:05:14 I don’t know where the camera is, this way.
00:05:16 That’s beautiful.
00:05:18 Look at that, Cookies Amore.
00:05:19 And we didn’t even know about it.
00:05:21 The sister composed it,
00:05:23 and it has a beautiful display and examples.
00:05:27 It’s outstanding.
00:05:29 Wow!
00:05:29 Oh, that’s beautiful to see
00:05:31 —how everyone has rallied around both of you to support you.
00:05:34 So the last question,
00:05:36 How have you seen Jehovah’s hand in your lives
00:05:38 as you face this challenge?
00:05:40 Maybe we could start with you, Rainer, please.
00:05:42 Yes, of course.
00:05:43 This is a very difficult situation,
00:05:46 because when you’re paralyzed, it’s bad.
00:05:49 But if you’re paralyzed and you’re not able to speak,
00:05:54 that makes for a very difficult situation, you know.
00:05:58 But the help of the brothers has been outstanding.
00:06:02 The love—it’s remarkable.
00:06:07 Thank you for sharing.
00:06:09 What about you, Karen?
00:06:13 We appreciate now why the infirmary is always mentioned
00:06:17 in the letters to the Bethel family.
00:06:19 The ones who take care of us
00:06:22 cannot be compared to others in the same profession.
00:06:26 They work with heart.
00:06:28 It isn’t just a job to them, but they work with love.
00:06:32 My aunt was on Zoom
00:06:34 when a PCA kissed me on the forehead as she left.
00:06:37 My aunt said, with tears in her eyes,
00:06:41 “They love her.”
