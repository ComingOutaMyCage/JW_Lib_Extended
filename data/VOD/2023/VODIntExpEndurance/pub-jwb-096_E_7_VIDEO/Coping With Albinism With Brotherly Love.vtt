00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, my years in school were not easy.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:09.926 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some would tease me,

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.761 line:10% position:50% align:center
others would laugh at me,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.129 line:10% position:50% align:center
and still others would use

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.764 line:10% position:50% align:center
hurtful words toward me.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.501 line:10% position:50% align:center
I felt unloved and not needed.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sadly, my parents refused

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
to take me to school.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.773 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The best you can do

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.241 line:10% position:50% align:center
“is to get rid of this child;

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.910 line:10% position:50% align:center
just throw her away.”

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
That is what my father

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:29.646 line:10% position:50% align:center
was told by his friend.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prejudice against people with albinism
can be very cruel.

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who are targeted
can be traumatized for life.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Albinism is a genetic disorder

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:47.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which ones eyes, skin, or hair
have little or no pigmentation.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
People with this condition
struggle with vision problems.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Extreme sensitivity to sunlight

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:56.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
also puts them
at a high risk for skin cancer.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beyond the physical challenges,

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
they also have to deal
with unwarranted social stigmas.

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some African countries,

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
people with albinism
are even attacked or killed

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
by those involved in spiritistic rituals.

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
This leads them

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live in isolation.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila used to cry often

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:18.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel down,

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since she has learned
the truth in the Bible,

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:23.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
she has found comfort.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped me to endure all these trials

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
was praying to Jehovah regularly

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reading his Word, the Bible.

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first scripture that touches me deeply

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Psalm 18:25.

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
This scripture touches my heart

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to know that if I continue
being loyal and righteous,

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cannot forget

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:48.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will also “act in loyalty” toward me.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
James was the target of intense ridicule.

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
He isolated himself

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:55.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and felt worthless.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture I love the most is John 17:3.

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read this scripture,
I was very happy

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I realized that Jehovah values me,

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
or is concerned about me.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this showed me that Jehovah loves me.

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:20.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judith has now spent 24 years
in the full-time ministry.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:25.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a young girl,
she was the target of vicious ridicule.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
She felt insecure and kept to herself.

00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:32.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:3, 4—

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I read this scripture, ah,

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
my faith is strengthened.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel very happy.

00:02:39.843 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only through diligent,
daily Bible reading

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:47.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attending the meetings with our brothers

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and going out in the ministry

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this makes me strong and fortifies my faith.

00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:58.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people love and accept
those who suffer from various conditions,

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:00.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
including albinism.

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila, James, and Judith

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
are among those who have experienced

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:09.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
that brotherly love and acceptance
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:13.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a big difference
between how people of the world

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:15.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how the brothers view me.

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:25.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love they have shown me
has helped me prove that really

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:27.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is a spiritual family.

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I am among my brothers and sisters,

00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:35.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not see any difference
or think that I have different skin.

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I feel loved and happy.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not lack anything.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:50.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my spiritual family.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:53.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever I am among brothers and sisters,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel happy and protected

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they show me true love.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila serves as a zealous regular pioneer.

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:09.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
She has overcome illiteracy

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now knows how to cope
with hostility and prejudice.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite all the negative things
she faced in the past,

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s now positive and cheerful

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has her life and hope
firmly based on Jehovah’s promises.

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:28.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
James still has to deal
with prejudiced people from time to time,

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he does not allow that
to make him bitter.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
Rather, he chooses to respond

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.693 line:10% position:50% align:center
in a kind manner.

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:40.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judith has experienced
many disappointments in life,

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
but above all, she cherishes being
one of Jehovah’s people.

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:49.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
This overwhelming, impartial love

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
shown by fellow brothers and sisters
in the congregations

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a source of support and help

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only for individuals with albinism

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for anyone who struggles
with a challenging physical condition

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
or disability.

00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, “mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:23.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are the words found at 1 Samuel 16:7,

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:27.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was one of the verses we saw
on the chalkboard in the video.

00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:31.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly saw
into the hearts of James,

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tasila, and Judith

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reassured them of His love
through the congregation.
