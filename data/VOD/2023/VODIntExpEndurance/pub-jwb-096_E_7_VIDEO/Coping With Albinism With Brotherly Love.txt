00:00:03 Well, my years in school were not easy.
00:00:08 Some would tease me,
00:00:09 others would laugh at me,
00:00:11 and still others would use
00:00:13 hurtful words toward me.
00:00:15 I felt unloved and not needed.
00:00:18 Sadly, my parents refused
00:00:20 to take me to school.
00:00:22 “The best you can do
00:00:23 “is to get rid of this child;
00:00:25 just throw her away.”
00:00:26 That is what my father
00:00:28 was told by his friend.
00:00:32 Prejudice against people with albinism can be very cruel.
00:00:37 Those who are targeted can be traumatized for life.
00:00:40 Albinism is a genetic disorder
00:00:42 in which ones eyes, skin, or hair have little or no pigmentation.
00:00:48 People with this condition struggle with vision problems.
00:00:51 Extreme sensitivity to sunlight
00:00:53 also puts them at a high risk for skin cancer.
00:00:57 Beyond the physical challenges,
00:00:59 they also have to deal with unwarranted social stigmas.
00:01:03 In some African countries,
00:01:05 people with albinism are even attacked or killed
00:01:08 by those involved in spiritistic rituals.
00:01:11 This leads them
00:01:12 to live in isolation.
00:01:14 Tasila used to cry often
00:01:16 and feel down,
00:01:18 but since she has learned the truth in the Bible,
00:01:20 she has found comfort.
00:01:23 What helped me to endure all these trials
00:01:26 was praying to Jehovah regularly
00:01:29 and reading his Word, the Bible.
00:01:31 The first scripture that touches me deeply
00:01:34 is Psalm 18:25.
00:01:38 This scripture touches my heart
00:01:40 —to know that if I continue being loyal and righteous,
00:01:43 Jehovah cannot forget
00:01:45 and he will also “act in loyalty” toward me.
00:01:48 James was the target of intense ridicule.
00:01:51 He isolated himself
00:01:53 and felt worthless.
00:01:56 The scripture I love the most is John 17:3.
00:02:02 When I read this scripture, I was very happy
00:02:06 because I realized that Jehovah values me,
00:02:09 or is concerned about me.
00:02:13 So this showed me that Jehovah loves me.
00:02:16 Judith has now spent 24 years in the full-time ministry.
00:02:21 As a young girl, she was the target of vicious ridicule.
00:02:25 She felt insecure and kept to herself.
00:02:29 Revelation 21:3, 4—
00:02:32 when I read this scripture, ah,
00:02:35 my faith is strengthened.
00:02:36 I feel very happy.
00:02:39 It’s only through diligent, daily Bible reading
00:02:43 and attending the meetings with our brothers
00:02:47 and going out in the ministry
00:02:50 —this makes me strong and fortifies my faith.
00:02:54 Jehovah’s people love and accept those who suffer from various conditions,
00:02:58 including albinism.
00:03:01 Tasila, James, and Judith
00:03:04 are among those who have experienced
00:03:06 that brotherly love and acceptance in Jehovah’s organization.
00:03:10 There is a big difference between how people of the world
00:03:13 and how the brothers view me.
00:03:21 The love they have shown me has helped me prove that really
00:03:25 this is a spiritual family.
00:03:28 When I am among my brothers and sisters,
00:03:31 I do not see any difference or think that I have different skin.
00:03:36 But I feel loved and happy.
00:03:39 I do not lack anything.
00:03:48 This is my spiritual family.
00:03:50 Whenever I am among brothers and sisters,
00:03:53 I feel happy and protected
00:04:00 because they show me true love.
00:04:03 Tasila serves as a zealous regular pioneer.
00:04:07 She has overcome illiteracy
00:04:09 and now knows how to cope with hostility and prejudice.
00:04:13 Despite all the negative things she faced in the past,
00:04:17 she’s now positive and cheerful
00:04:20 and has her life and hope firmly based on Jehovah’s promises.
00:04:24 James still has to deal with prejudiced people from time to time,
00:04:29 but he does not allow that to make him bitter.
00:04:32 Rather, he chooses to respond
00:04:34 in a kind manner.
00:04:37 Judith has experienced many disappointments in life,
00:04:41 but above all, she cherishes being one of Jehovah’s people.
00:04:46 This overwhelming, impartial love
00:04:49 shown by fellow brothers and sisters in the congregations
00:04:52 is a source of support and help
00:04:54 not only for individuals with albinism
00:04:56 but for anyone who struggles with a challenging physical condition
00:05:00 or disability.
00:05:02 Yes, “mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:05:06 but Jehovah sees into the heart.”
00:05:11 “Mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
00:05:15 but Jehovah sees into the heart.”
00:05:18 Those are the words found at 1 Samuel 16:7,
00:05:23 and it was one of the verses we saw on the chalkboard in the video.
00:05:27 Jehovah certainly saw into the hearts of James,
00:05:31 Tasila, and Judith
00:05:33 and reassured them of His love through the congregation.
