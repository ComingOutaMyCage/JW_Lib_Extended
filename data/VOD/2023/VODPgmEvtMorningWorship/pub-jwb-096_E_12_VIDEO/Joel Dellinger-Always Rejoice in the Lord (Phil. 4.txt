00:00:01 What do we have here in the letter
00:00:02 that Paul wrote under inspiration
00:00:04 to the congregation in Philippi?
00:00:07 A letter that breathes love
00:00:09 and that motivates us
00:00:12 to increase in displaying godly joy.
00:00:17 Now, that may not always be easy
00:00:19 because life in this system of things can be very difficult.
00:00:23 In fact, perhaps you or your family or close friends
00:00:26 are facing a Goliathlike challenge at this moment.
00:00:31 But think a little bit more about the context
00:00:33 and who wrote this letter to the Philippians,
00:00:36 where we’re told to “always rejoice.”
00:00:39 It was the apostle Paul.
00:00:41 Do you know where Paul was when he wrote the letter?
00:00:45 Not in any comfortable office.
00:00:47 He was in a prison, likely in Rome.
00:00:51 Yet Paul’s positive attitude makes it very clear
00:00:54 that deep-seated joy
00:00:56 does not depend on our circumstances.
00:01:00 But we do know that cultivating joy requires personal effort.
00:01:04 How so?
00:01:05 Well, think about it.
00:01:07 We know that joy, that pleasant emotion that we feel
00:01:10 when we receive something good or we anticipate receiving good things,
00:01:15 is a product of holy spirit.
00:01:17 So we have to do something in order to obtain more holy spirit.
00:01:21 We have to pray for it constantly.
00:01:23 And we can do that constantly without ever doubting
00:01:26 that Jehovah wants to give us more holy spirit
00:01:30 because Jesus assured us that He’s a tender heavenly Father
00:01:33 who gives generously to His children who ask for it.
00:01:37 But in addition to praying constantly, what more can we do?
00:01:41 Well, like the apostle Paul, even when we’re
00:01:44 in the midst of trying circumstances,
00:01:47 we need to think about good things —our blessings—
00:01:50 and we need to talk with our brothers and sisters about those blessings.
00:01:55 For a few moments, let’s do that.
00:01:57 Let’s put aside for a moment
00:02:00 any distracting worry or challenge
00:02:02 or obstacle that we’re facing,
00:02:04 and let’s savor three special blessings
00:02:08 that Jehovah has given all of us as his people.
00:02:11 Our first blessing is alluded to at Proverbs 4:18.
00:02:16 You might take your eyes there to Proverbs 4:18.
00:02:21 There, in contrast with the path, or the way, of the wicked one,
00:02:25 we’re told that “the path of the righteous
00:02:28 “[that’s your path; that’s my path] is like the bright morning light
00:02:32 that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.”
00:02:37 Well, this reminds us that we have all been recipients
00:02:40 of spiritual enlightenment.
00:02:42 And that’s quite a contrast to Satan’s system,
00:02:45 which currently is in dense spiritual darkness.
00:02:49 Think about what we enjoy because of what Jehovah has given us
00:02:53 in the way of spiritual enlightenment.
00:02:56 We know things that the world has no clue about.
00:03:01 We know that Jehovah is our God,
00:03:03 the God who “Causes to Become”
00:03:05 and can cause you and me to become whatever is needed
00:03:08 to fulfill his good purpose and to bring us joy.
00:03:12 We know about Jesus, the powerful angels,
00:03:15 and the establishment of the Kingdom in 1914, a real government.
00:03:20 None of this is any mystery to us.
00:03:23 We know the truth.
00:03:25 We know that the big issue is not what we may see in the headlines
00:03:28 of the world’s newspapers.
00:03:30 The big issue has to do with universal sovereignty.
00:03:33 And who will we choose to support
00:03:36 —Jehovah’s side or Satan’s side?
00:03:40 Thanks to the gift of spiritual enlightenment,
00:03:42 a path that keeps getting “brighter and brighter” for us
00:03:46 as we walk closely with Jehovah and his organization,
00:03:49 we know why we suffer, why we die,
00:03:52 and how temporary all of these challenging circumstances are.
00:03:58 We are confident there will be a resurrection.
00:04:00 So no matter what happens in this system of things
00:04:03 to us personally or to those whom we love,
00:04:06 Jehovah will undo all the damage
00:04:09 very easily
00:04:11 because he can do so and he wants to do so.
00:04:15 Of course, there are many things that we don’t yet know
00:04:18 about the future and Jehovah’s details
00:04:21 with regard to us personally.
00:04:24 We don’t know the exact date of the end of this wicked system of things.
00:04:28 But our purpose in life is no secret.
00:04:31 We know what our purpose in life is.
00:04:33 We’re going to live forever
00:04:35 so that we can praise and fear Jehovah for all eternity.
00:04:40 Now, what do you think as we ponder our gift, our blessing,
00:04:44 of spiritual enlightenment?
00:04:46 Is it ordinary, or is it extraordinary?
00:04:50 That’s a gift that when we think about it
00:04:53 and when we talk about it, it increases our joy.
00:04:58 Let’s consider a second spiritual blessing.
00:05:01 It’s referred to at Isaiah 60:22.
00:05:04 Please read that with me
00:05:06 —Isaiah 60:22:
00:05:10 “The little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation.
00:05:14 I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.”
00:05:19 What’s the blessing?
00:05:21 As foretold, we are seeing spiritual growth.
00:05:24 Our spiritual family
00:05:27 is getting larger and larger by the day.
00:05:31 In fact, on average, during the 2017 service year,
00:05:34 each week 5,400 were baptized
00:05:39 in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah.
00:05:42 And in harmony with the prophecy, this growth will accelerate.
00:05:47 Well, what does that mean for us?
00:05:49 It means that our work here at Bethel,
00:05:51 at remote translation offices, at facilities
00:05:55 —doing maintenance and cleaning and caring
00:05:57 for these beautiful facilities dedicated to Jehovah’s worship—
00:06:01 at the Assembly Halls is urgent, necessary work
00:06:05 that supports our growing spiritual family.
00:06:09 It’s another one of the blessings
00:06:11 that Jehovah has given you and me,
00:06:14 this blessing of seeing firsthand
00:06:17 the growth of our spiritual family and being able to support it.
00:06:21 Well, consider in that same chapter of Isaiah (chapter 60)
00:06:25 an additional blessing, a third, mentioned in verse 17:
00:06:29 “Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,
00:06:33 “and instead of the iron I will bring in silver,
00:06:36 “instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron;
00:06:40 “and I will appoint peace as your overseers
00:06:43 and righteousness as your task assigners.”
00:06:46 Have you seen the fulfillment of this prophecy
00:06:49 during this special time, “the conclusion of the system of things”?
00:06:53 Indeed we have.
00:06:54 We have seen, experienced,
00:06:57 improvements in organizational arrangements.
00:07:01 Some in our families, congregation, and here at Bethel
00:07:04 remember when a congregation had a congregation servant
00:07:08 and not a body of elders,
00:07:10 when countries had a branch servant and not a Branch Committee,
00:07:13 and when direction was given often by the president
00:07:16 of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
00:07:18 rather than by a clearly established Governing Body.
00:07:22 During the 1970’s, though, there were improvements.
00:07:26 Direction in the congregations was given principally
00:07:29 by a body of elders, not by one individual.
00:07:32 Think of more recent organizational improvements
00:07:35 having to do with our theocratic schools.
00:07:37 The School for Kingdom Evangelizers is
00:07:39 another one of those recent organizational improvements.
00:07:43 It’s incredible to think that it was seven years ago, in July 2011,
00:07:48 that the then new school
00:07:50 The Bible School for Christian Couples was inaugurated at Patterson Bethel.
00:07:55 But then just two years later, in 2013,
00:07:57 the Governing Body approved the merger of the Bible School for Christian Couples
00:08:02 with the Bible School for Single Brothers.
00:08:04 And now we have what is known as the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:08:08 And what has resulted?
00:08:10 Increase, strengthening of congregations,
00:08:13 and diligent workers in the harvest
00:08:16 caring for assistance with maintenance of facilities
00:08:20 and supporting the work in foreign- and indigenous-language fields.
00:08:25 You know, thinking about this and those other blessings
00:08:27 we’ve just discussed briefly,
00:08:30 reminds me of the example in the Scriptures
00:08:33 of the experience of the unnamed and poor widow of Zarephath
00:08:36 during the time of the prophet Elijah.
00:08:39 In faith, though her circumstances were dire,
00:08:43 she used her last bit of flour and oil to make bread for Jehovah’s prophet.
00:08:47 And what happened?
00:08:48 As Elijah had promised, Jehovah added to her supply of food
00:08:53 so that there was enough to feed her, her son, and the prophet.
00:08:58 “The large jar of flour did not run out,
00:09:00 and the small jar of oil did not run dry.”
00:09:03 Brothers and sisters, each of us has a figurative jar of blessings,
00:09:07 a jar of joys,
00:09:11 that is never going to run out.
00:09:13 Regularly, we need to stop
00:09:15 and think about what’s in our jar of blessings.
00:09:18 We need to talk about them.
00:09:20 As our Kingdom song number 111 says:
00:09:23 “Our reasons for joy are abundant,”
00:09:26 and they are “like riches increasing in worth.”
00:09:29 So like the apostle Paul,
00:09:31 even if our circumstances at this moment are very difficult,
00:09:36 incredibly with Jehovah’s help,
00:09:38 you and I can always rejoice.
