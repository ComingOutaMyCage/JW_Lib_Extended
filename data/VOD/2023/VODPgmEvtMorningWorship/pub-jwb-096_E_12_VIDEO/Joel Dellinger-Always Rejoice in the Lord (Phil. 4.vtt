00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:02.786 line:10% position:50% align:center
What do we have here in the letter

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:04.888 line:10% position:50% align:center
that Paul wrote under inspiration

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:07.123 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the congregation in Philippi?

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:09.959 line:10% position:50% align:center
A letter that breathes love

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.395 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that motivates us

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.533 line:10% position:50% align:center
to increase in displaying godly joy.

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that may not always be easy

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
because life in this system of things
can be very difficult.

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:26.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, perhaps you
or your family or close friends

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing a Goliathlike challenge
at this moment.

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think a little bit more about the context

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:36.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who wrote this letter to the Philippians,

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we’re told to “always rejoice.”

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the apostle Paul.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know where Paul was
when he wrote the letter?

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not in any comfortable office.

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was in a prison, likely in Rome.

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:54.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet Paul’s positive attitude
makes it very clear

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
that deep-seated joy

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:00.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not depend on our circumstances.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do know that cultivating joy
requires personal effort.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:07.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about it.

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that joy,
that pleasant emotion that we feel

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we receive something good
or we anticipate receiving good things,

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a product of holy spirit.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:21.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to do something
in order to obtain more holy spirit.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to pray for it constantly.

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can do that constantly
without ever doubting

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:30.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah wants
to give us more holy spirit

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus assured us
that He’s a tender heavenly Father

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:37.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
who gives generously to His children
who ask for it.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in addition to praying constantly,
what more can we do?

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:44.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, like the apostle Paul, even when we’re

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:47.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of trying circumstances,

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:50.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to think about good things
—our blessings—

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we need to talk with our brothers
and sisters about those blessings.

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:57.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a few moments, let’s do that.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s put aside for a moment

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
any distracting worry or challenge

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
or obstacle that we’re facing,

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s savor three special blessings

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:11.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
has given all of us as his people.

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:16.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our first blessing
is alluded to at Proverbs 4:18.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might take your eyes there
to Proverbs 4:18.

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
There, in contrast with the path,
or the way, of the wicked one,

00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re told that “the path of the righteous

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:32.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that’s your path; that’s my path]
is like the bright morning light

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that grows brighter and brighter
until full daylight.”

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:40.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this reminds us
that we have all been recipients

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:42.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
of spiritual enlightenment.

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s quite a contrast
to Satan’s system,

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:49.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
which currently
is in dense spiritual darkness.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what we enjoy
because of what Jehovah has given us

00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:56.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way of spiritual enlightenment.

00:02:56.526 --> 00:03:01.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know things that the world
has no clue about.

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:03.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah is our God,

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God who “Causes to Become”

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can cause you and me
to become whatever is needed

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fulfill his good purpose
and to bring us joy.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know about Jesus, the powerful angels,

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:20.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the establishment
of the Kingdom in 1914, a real government.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of this is any mystery to us.

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the truth.

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that the big issue
is not what we may see in the headlines

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the world’s newspapers.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
The big issue
has to do with universal sovereignty.

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:36.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who will we choose to support

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s side or Satan’s side?

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to the gift
of spiritual enlightenment,

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
a path that keeps getting
“brighter and brighter” for us

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we walk closely
with Jehovah and his organization,

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know why we suffer, why we die,

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how temporary
all of these challenging circumstances are.

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are confident
there will be a resurrection.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no matter what happens
in this system of things

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
to us personally or to those whom we love,

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will undo all the damage

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:11.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
very easily

00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:14.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he can do so and he wants to do so.

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:18.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, there are many things
that we don’t yet know

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:21.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the future and Jehovah’s details

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to us personally.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:28.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know the exact date
of the end of this wicked system of things.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:31.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our purpose in life is no secret.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know what our purpose in life is.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to live forever

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:40.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can praise and fear Jehovah
for all eternity.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do you think
as we ponder our gift, our blessing,

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
of spiritual enlightenment?

00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:49.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it ordinary, or is it extraordinary?

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a gift that when we think about it

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we talk about it,
it increases our joy.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a second spiritual blessing.

00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:04.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s referred to at Isaiah 60:22.

00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read that with me

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:10.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 60:22:

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The little one will become a thousand
and the small one a mighty nation.

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
I myself, Jehovah,
will speed it up in its own time.”

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the blessing?

00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:24.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
As foretold, we are seeing spiritual growth.

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:27.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our spiritual family

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:31.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
is getting larger and larger by the day.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, on average,
during the 2017 service year,

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:39.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
each week 5,400 were baptized

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:42.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah.

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in harmony with the prophecy,
this growth will accelerate.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does that mean for us?

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that our work here at Bethel,

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
at remote translation offices, at facilities

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
—doing maintenance and cleaning and caring

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these beautiful facilities
dedicated to Jehovah’s worship—

00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:05.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Assembly Halls
is urgent, necessary work

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
that supports our growing spiritual family.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s another one of the blessings

00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:14.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given you and me,

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:17.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
this blessing of seeing firsthand

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
the growth of our spiritual family
and being able to support it.

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:25.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider in that same chapter
of Isaiah (chapter 60)

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
an additional blessing, a third,
mentioned in verse 17:

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:33.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,

00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:36.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and instead of the iron
I will bring in silver,

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“instead of the wood, copper,
and instead of the stones, iron;

00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will appoint peace as your overseers

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
and righteousness as your task assigners.”

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you seen
the fulfillment of this prophecy

00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:53.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this special time,
“the conclusion of the system of things”?

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed we have.

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:57.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have seen, experienced,

00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
improvements in organizational arrangements.

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some in our families, congregation,
and here at Bethel

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember when a congregation
had a congregation servant

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:10.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not a body of elders,

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:13.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
when countries had a branch servant
and not a Branch Committee,

00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:16.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when direction was given
often by the president

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:18.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than by a clearly
established Governing Body.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the 1970’s,
though, there were improvements.

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:29.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Direction in the congregations
was given principally

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:32.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a body of elders, not by one individual.

00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:35.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of more recent
organizational improvements

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
having to do with our theocratic schools.

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:39.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
The School for Kingdom Evangelizers is

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
another one of those
recent organizational improvements.

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:48.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s incredible to think that it
was seven years ago, in July 2011,

00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the then new school

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible School for Christian Couples
was inaugurated at Patterson Bethel.

00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then just two years later, in 2013,

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:02.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body approved the merger
of the Bible School for Christian Couples

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:04.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Bible School for Single Brothers.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we have what is known
as the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what has resulted?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Increase, strengthening of congregations,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and diligent workers in the harvest

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:20.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for assistance
with maintenance of facilities

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and supporting the work
in foreign- and indigenous-language fields.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, thinking about this
and those other blessings

00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve just discussed briefly,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds me of the example in the Scriptures

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:36.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the experience of the unnamed
and poor widow of Zarephath

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time of the prophet Elijah.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
In faith, though her circumstances were dire,

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:47.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
she used her last bit of flour and oil
to make bread for Jehovah’s prophet.

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:48.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happened?

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:53.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Elijah had promised,
Jehovah added to her supply of food

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that there was enough
to feed her, her son, and the prophet.

00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:00.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The large jar of flour did not run out,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the small jar of oil did not run dry.”

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:07.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
each of us has a figurative jar of blessings,

00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
a jar of joys,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is never going to run out.

00:09:13.569 --> 00:09:15.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regularly, we need to stop

00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and think about what’s
in our jar of blessings.

00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to talk about them.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our Kingdom song number 111 says:

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our reasons for joy are abundant,”

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:29.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are
“like riches increasing in worth.”

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like the apostle Paul,

00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:36.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if our circumstances at this moment
are very difficult,

00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:38.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
incredibly with Jehovah’s help,

00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:42.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
you and I can always rejoice.
