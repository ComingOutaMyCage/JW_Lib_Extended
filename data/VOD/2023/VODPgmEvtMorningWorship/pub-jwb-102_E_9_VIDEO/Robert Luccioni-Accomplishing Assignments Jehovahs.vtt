00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is more important?

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:04.859 line:10% position:50% align:center
Finishing an assignment

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.360 line:10% position:50% align:center
or how we go about

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
carrying out the assignment?

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.947 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, our text for today

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:11.824 line:10% position:50% align:center
uses the Day of Atonement

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
to illustrate that the way

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.870 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus went about living his life

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
was actually even more important

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
than that one act of salvation.

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why?

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s because
the way Jesus lived his life

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
—carried out his ministry—
addressed Satan’s challenge.

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus proved
that doing things Jehovah’s way

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the right way to live.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, Jesus, by his life,
upheld Jehovah’s sovereignty,

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that made his sacrifice
acceptable to Jehovah.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are some ways
in which Jesus upheld,

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
or vindicated,
Jehovah’s sovereignty?

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can we imitate Jesus
in our assignments?

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are many things
we could talk about today,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let’s just consider three ways.

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
One is that Jesus
worked on Jehovah’s initiatives,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
not his own.

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we know,
Jesus could calm storms,

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could heal people,
and he could feed people.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Jesus could have decided,
‘Well, yes, I’m going to preach,

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but I’m also going to focus my energies
on helping people

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
—setting up relief activities,
healing the sick, helping the poor.’

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:28.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or when the people
wanted to make Jesus king,

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could have decided,
‘Well, let me let them make me king,

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:37.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I can address
some of the problems of the day.’

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:40.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus loved children,

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people loved the way Jesus taught.

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus could have thought,
‘Well, I’m going to preach,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but I’m going to focus my energy
on setting up schools

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can teach young people
to learn about Jehovah.’

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus could have done
all of those things.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did he do?

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at Luke chapter 4

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 43 and notice

00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
what it quotes him saying
in response to the crowds

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanting him to stay and help them.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 4:43: “But he said to them:

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I must also declare the good news
of the Kingdom of God to other cities,

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
because for this I was sent.’”

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus never lost sight of why he was there,
what his assignment was.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stayed focused,
and he focused his energies

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what Jehovah wanted done.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we imitate Jesus
in our assignments?

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we know, there are many things

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could get involved in
as an organization (good things)

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
—expanding our relief activities,

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping the poor, teaching,

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
setting up schools to teach other people,
or many other initiatives.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s nothing wrong with us

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
presenting a new idea
or initiative to our oversight.

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do we do once a decision is made?

00:02:57.906 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we follow the direction.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
We throw ourselves into the initiatives
given to us from our oversight.

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:09.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, we subject ourselves
to what Jehovah wants his organization to do

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he wants it done.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not about what we think
the organization should be doing.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s about what Jehovah wants done.

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at another example.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus worked
within the organizational structures

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had in place
or allowed to be in place.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus saw the hypocrisy, the corruption,

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:35.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inefficiencies of the Jewish arrangements
that were there in place at the time.

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other arrangements, though not bad,

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
had served their purpose
or were only temporary

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:42.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
—were soon to end.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would Jesus do?

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember the account
as recorded at Matthew 8:4,

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he healed the man with leprosy.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he tell the man to do?

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:54.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Go, show yourself to the priest.”

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus knew the man was clean,

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
but yet he told him
to follow the arrangement.

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Galatians 4:4, it says
that Jesus “was under law.”

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that he observed the Sabbath.

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know that Jehovah
established the Sabbath

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a temporary arrangement

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach people to take time
to meditate on spiritual things.

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:18.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus understood the principle
behind the Sabbath.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
He meditated on spiritual things every day,

00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:24.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knew it was soon going to end.

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:28.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet he respected
and followed the arrangement.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting
that regarding the Pharisees,

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
it records him saying at Matthew 23:3:

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All . . . they tell you, do and observe.”

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:38.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to listen to the Pharisees,

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:39.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though
they weren’t doing the right thing.

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:40.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:43.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that was the arrangement.

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:47.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus worked within the arrangements
that Jehovah had in place

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
or had not yet seen fit to change.

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we imitate Jesus
in our assignments?

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, even within the organization,

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may see functions,
departments, processes

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:03.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
that personally
we may perceive as inefficient

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
or complicated or out-of-date.

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah obviously
has allowed these structures to be in place

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:14.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
or has not yet seen fit to change them.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do we see how supporting them,

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:19.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
working with them,
not working around these arrangements

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:24.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
is another way of us supporting
Jehovah’s right to rule his way?

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:27.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s look at another example, the third.

00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:32.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus understood the limits of his authority.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:37.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke, excuse me,
Matthew 11:27,

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:42.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “All things have been
handed over to me by my Father.”

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:44.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All things”

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:49.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and yet Jesus understood
that his authority had boundaries.

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:52.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the account in Luke chapter 12,

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:55.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the man in the crowd said to Jesus:

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:58.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Teacher, tell my brother
to divide [his] inheritance with me.”

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus do?

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘OK, well, let’s talk about that.’

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:03.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:07.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Man, who appointed me judge
or arbitrator between you two?”

00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:09.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Wait a minute.
I thought you had all authority.’

00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:11.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or when the Phoenician woman came to Jesus

00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:14.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked him to heal her daughter.

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:15.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus say?

00:06:15.687 --> 00:06:17.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I was not sent to anyone

00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
except to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.”

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, even though Jesus did help her,
we see his words illustrate

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he understood
that his authority had limits.

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:34.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, notice what he says
as recorded at John 5:19.

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:38.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 5:19:

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, in response Jesus said to them:

00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:43.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Most truly I say to you,

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:48.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the Son cannot do a single thing
of his own initiative,

00:06:48.804 --> 00:06:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but only what he sees the Father doing.

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:53.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For whatever things that One does,

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:58.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
these things the Son
does also in like manner.’”

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:01.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Son cannot do a single thing,”

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:04.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he has all authority.

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:08.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we imitate Jesus
in our assignments?

00:07:08.323 --> 00:07:12.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I know for me, the Governing Body
provides a beautiful example of that.

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:16.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Periodically, we will get a call
in our department

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:18.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a Governing Body member

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
who maybe has observed something
regarding one of our branch facilities

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:24.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
or has a suggestion or a concern.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
And invariably, at the end of the call,
the brother will say:

00:07:28.135 --> 00:07:32.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, remember,
this is just my opinion and observation.

00:07:32.347 --> 00:07:34.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please do not take this as direction.

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The members of the Publishing Committee
may have a different perspective.”

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:42.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even the Governing Body members 
understand

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:45.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
that their authority has boundaries.

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:48.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a good example for us to follow!

00:07:48.572 --> 00:07:53.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know in the secular world,
the more responsibility one has,

00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more authority they have.

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:58.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t it true
that it’s exactly the opposite

00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:00.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
within Jehovah’s organization?

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:03.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more responsibility we have,

00:08:03.503 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more checks and balances there are
that limit our authority.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:11.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to me, that is a beautiful arrangement
that Jehovah has set in place,

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:14.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that ensures that it is impossible

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
for one man to rise up

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:19.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take control of the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:21.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not possible.

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:25.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is clear that Jehovah is taking the lead
through his Son, Jesus.

00:08:25.317 --> 00:08:28.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, see, the point is that
when we understand 

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
our place in the arrangement,

00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:33.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
we uphold Jehovah’s authority

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his right to rule his way.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we contrast all of that with Satan

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:42.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
who promotes independence
and doing his own thing.

00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:46.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sets up rival and competing
organizational arrangements

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has no idea
of the limits of his authority.

00:08:50.884 --> 00:08:55.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, really, it drives home the point
at Luke 9:23.

00:08:55.347 --> 00:08:58.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together.

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 9:23:

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:06.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he went on to say to all:

00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:09.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If anyone wants to come after me,

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘let him disown himself

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and pick up his torture stake day after day

00:09:14.783 --> 00:09:17.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep following me.’”

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:19.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, when we choose to follow Christ,

00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:22.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we chose to follow Jesus, we said,

00:09:22.207 --> 00:09:24.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are going to put our will
in the background,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to submit to Jehovah’s will.”

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in summary, Jesus’ example shows us

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:34.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not just
finishing an assignment that’s important

00:09:34.219 --> 00:09:38.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also how we go about
doing that assignment.

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:40.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question for today is,

00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the way
I am accomplishing my assignments

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
demonstrate that I support
Jehovah’s sovereignty?

00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:52.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we contemplate
Jesus’ death and ransom,

00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:54.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
may we also think about his example,

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:56.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in just these three ways
we’ve discussed.

00:09:56.741 --> 00:09:59.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may we be resolved to imitate Jesus

00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:04.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
by (1) working on the things
Jehovah wants done,

00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:08.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) using the arrangements
that he has put in place,

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:11.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) working within the limits
of our own authority.

00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:15.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this way,
we too will demonstrate that we believe

00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:19.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
that doing things Jehovah’s way
is the right way to live.
