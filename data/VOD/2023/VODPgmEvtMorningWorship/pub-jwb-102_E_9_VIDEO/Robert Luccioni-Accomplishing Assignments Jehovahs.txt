00:00:01 What is more important?
00:00:03 Finishing an assignment
00:00:04 or how we go about
00:00:06 carrying out the assignment?
00:00:08 Well, our text for today
00:00:09 uses the Day of Atonement
00:00:11 to illustrate that the way
00:00:13 Jesus went about living his life
00:00:15 was actually even more important
00:00:18 than that one act of salvation.
00:00:21 Now, why?
00:00:23 Well, that’s because the way Jesus lived his life
00:00:26 —carried out his ministry— addressed Satan’s challenge.
00:00:30 And Jesus proved that doing things Jehovah’s way
00:00:35 is the right way to live.
00:00:37 Thus, Jesus, by his life, upheld Jehovah’s sovereignty,
00:00:41 and that made his sacrifice acceptable to Jehovah.
00:00:46 So, what are some ways in which Jesus upheld,
00:00:49 or vindicated, Jehovah’s sovereignty?
00:00:52 And how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments?
00:00:55 Well, there are many things we could talk about today,
00:00:57 but let’s just consider three ways.
00:01:00 One is that Jesus worked on Jehovah’s initiatives,
00:01:05 not his own.
00:01:07 Now, as we know, Jesus could calm storms,
00:01:10 he could heal people, and he could feed people.
00:01:12 And so Jesus could have decided, ‘Well, yes, I’m going to preach,
00:01:16 ‘but I’m also going to focus my energies on helping people
00:01:20 —setting up relief activities, healing the sick, helping the poor.’
00:01:25 Or when the people wanted to make Jesus king,
00:01:28 he could have decided, ‘Well, let me let them make me king,
00:01:33 and then I can address some of the problems of the day.’
00:01:37 Jesus loved children,
00:01:40 and people loved the way Jesus taught.
00:01:42 So Jesus could have thought, ‘Well, I’m going to preach,
00:01:45 ‘but I’m going to focus my energy on setting up schools
00:01:48 so that I can teach young people to learn about Jehovah.’
00:01:52 See, Jesus could have done all of those things.
00:01:55 But what did he do?
00:01:56 Well, let’s look at Luke chapter 4
00:01:59 and verse 43 and notice
00:02:01 what it quotes him saying in response to the crowds
00:02:03 wanting him to stay and help them.
00:02:05 Luke 4:43: “But he said to them:
00:02:10 “‘I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities,
00:02:14 because for this I was sent.’”
00:02:19 Jesus never lost sight of why he was there, what his assignment was.
00:02:24 He stayed focused, and he focused his energies
00:02:28 on what Jehovah wanted done.
00:02:30 Well, how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments?
00:02:34 Well, as we know, there are many things
00:02:36 that we could get involved in as an organization (good things)
00:02:39 —expanding our relief activities,
00:02:41 helping the poor, teaching,
00:02:44 setting up schools to teach other people, or many other initiatives.
00:02:48 And there’s nothing wrong with us
00:02:51 presenting a new idea or initiative to our oversight.
00:02:55 But what do we do once a decision is made?
00:02:57 Well, we follow the direction.
00:02:59 We throw ourselves into the initiatives given to us from our oversight.
00:03:04 See, we subject ourselves to what Jehovah wants his organization to do
00:03:09 and how he wants it done.
00:03:11 It’s not about what we think the organization should be doing.
00:03:14 It’s about what Jehovah wants done.
00:03:18 Let’s look at another example.
00:03:20 Jesus worked within the organizational structures
00:03:23 that Jehovah had in place or allowed to be in place.
00:03:27 Now, Jesus saw the hypocrisy, the corruption,
00:03:30 the inefficiencies of the Jewish arrangements that were there in place at the time.
00:03:35 Other arrangements, though not bad,
00:03:37 had served their purpose or were only temporary
00:03:40 —were soon to end.
00:03:42 What would Jesus do?
00:03:44 Well, remember the account as recorded at Matthew 8:4,
00:03:47 when he healed the man with leprosy.
00:03:49 What did he tell the man to do?
00:03:52 He said: “Go, show yourself to the priest.”
00:03:54 Now, Jesus knew the man was clean,
00:03:57 but yet he told him to follow the arrangement.
00:04:00 At Galatians 4:4, it says that Jesus “was under law.”
00:04:05 We know that he observed the Sabbath.
00:04:07 Now, we know that Jehovah established the Sabbath
00:04:09 as a temporary arrangement
00:04:11 to teach people to take time to meditate on spiritual things.
00:04:16 Well, Jesus understood the principle behind the Sabbath.
00:04:18 He meditated on spiritual things every day,
00:04:21 and he knew it was soon going to end.
00:04:24 And yet he respected and followed the arrangement.
00:04:28 It’s interesting that regarding the Pharisees,
00:04:30 it records him saying at Matthew 23:3:
00:04:33 “All . . . they tell you, do and observe.”
00:04:36 He said to listen to the Pharisees,
00:04:38 even though they weren’t doing the right thing.
00:04:39 Why?
00:04:40 Because that was the arrangement.
00:04:43 See, Jesus worked within the arrangements that Jehovah had in place
00:04:47 or had not yet seen fit to change.
00:04:50 So how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments?
00:04:54 Well, even within the organization,
00:04:57 we may see functions, departments, processes
00:05:00 that personally we may perceive as inefficient
00:05:03 or complicated or out-of-date.
00:05:06 Well, Jehovah obviously has allowed these structures to be in place
00:05:10 or has not yet seen fit to change them.
00:05:14 So do we see how supporting them,
00:05:16 working with them, not working around these arrangements
00:05:19 is another way of us supporting Jehovah’s right to rule his way?
00:05:25 So let’s look at another example, the third.
00:05:27 Jesus understood the limits of his authority.
00:05:32 At Luke, excuse me, Matthew 11:27,
00:05:37 Jesus said: “All things have been handed over to me by my Father.”
00:05:42 “All things”
00:05:44 —and yet Jesus understood that his authority had boundaries.
00:05:49 Remember the account in Luke chapter 12,
00:05:52 where the man in the crowd said to Jesus:
00:05:55 “Teacher, tell my brother to divide [his] inheritance with me.”
00:05:58 What did Jesus do?
00:06:00 ‘OK, well, let’s talk about that.’
00:06:02 No.
00:06:03 He said: “Man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?”
00:06:07 ‘Wait a minute. I thought you had all authority.’
00:06:09 Or when the Phoenician woman came to Jesus
00:06:11 and asked him to heal her daughter.
00:06:14 What did Jesus say?
00:06:15 He said: “I was not sent to anyone
00:06:17 except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
00:06:21 Now, even though Jesus did help her, we see his words illustrate
00:06:24 that he understood that his authority had limits.
00:06:29 In fact, notice what he says as recorded at John 5:19.
00:06:35 John 5:19:
00:06:38 “Therefore, in response Jesus said to them:
00:06:41 “‘Most truly I say to you,
00:06:43 “‘the Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative,
00:06:48 “‘but only what he sees the Father doing.
00:06:51 “‘For whatever things that One does,
00:06:53 these things the Son does also in like manner.’”
00:06:58 “The Son cannot do a single thing,”
00:07:01 but he has all authority.
00:07:04 So how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments?
00:07:08 Well, I know for me, the Governing Body provides a beautiful example of that.
00:07:12 Periodically, we will get a call in our department
00:07:16 from a Governing Body member
00:07:18 who maybe has observed something regarding one of our branch facilities
00:07:21 or has a suggestion or a concern.
00:07:24 And invariably, at the end of the call, the brother will say:
00:07:28 “Now, remember, this is just my opinion and observation.
00:07:32 “Please do not take this as direction.
00:07:34 “The members of the Publishing Committee may have a different perspective.”
00:07:38 Isn’t that beautiful?
00:07:40 Even the Governing Body members  understand
00:07:42 that their authority has boundaries.
00:07:45 What a good example for us to follow!
00:07:48 As we know in the secular world, the more responsibility one has,
00:07:53 the more authority they have.
00:07:56 But isn’t it true that it’s exactly the opposite
00:07:58 within Jehovah’s organization?
00:08:00 The more responsibility we have,
00:08:03 the more checks and balances there are that limit our authority.
00:08:07 And to me, that is a beautiful arrangement that Jehovah has set in place,
00:08:11 and that ensures that it is impossible
00:08:14 for one man to rise up
00:08:16 and take control of the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization.
00:08:19 It’s not possible.
00:08:21 It is clear that Jehovah is taking the lead through his Son, Jesus.
00:08:25 And, see, the point is that when we understand
00:08:28 our place in the arrangement,
00:08:30 we uphold Jehovah’s authority
00:08:33 and his right to rule his way.
00:08:36 Now, we contrast all of that with Satan
00:08:39 who promotes independence and doing his own thing.
00:08:42 He sets up rival and competing organizational arrangements
00:08:46 and has no idea of the limits of his authority.
00:08:50 So, really, it drives home the point at Luke 9:23.
00:08:55 Let’s read that together.
00:08:58 Luke 9:23:
00:09:04 “Then he went on to say to all:
00:09:06 “‘If anyone wants to come after me,
00:09:09 “‘let him disown himself
00:09:11 “‘and pick up his torture stake day after day
00:09:14 and keep following me.’”
00:09:17 See, when we choose to follow Christ,
00:09:19 when we chose to follow Jesus, we said,
00:09:22 “We are going to put our will in the background,
00:09:24 and we’re going to submit to Jehovah’s will.”
00:09:28 So in summary, Jesus’ example shows us
00:09:31 that it’s not just finishing an assignment that’s important
00:09:34 but also how we go about doing that assignment.
00:09:38 So the question for today is,
00:09:40 Does the way I am accomplishing my assignments
00:09:44 demonstrate that I support Jehovah’s sovereignty?
00:09:50 So as we contemplate Jesus’ death and ransom,
00:09:52 may we also think about his example,
00:09:54 even in just these three ways we’ve discussed.
00:09:56 And may we be resolved to imitate Jesus
00:09:59 by (1) working on the things Jehovah wants done,
00:10:04 (2) using the arrangements that he has put in place,
00:10:08 and (3) working within the limits of our own authority.
00:10:11 And in this way, we too will demonstrate that we believe
00:10:15 that doing things Jehovah’s way is the right way to live.
