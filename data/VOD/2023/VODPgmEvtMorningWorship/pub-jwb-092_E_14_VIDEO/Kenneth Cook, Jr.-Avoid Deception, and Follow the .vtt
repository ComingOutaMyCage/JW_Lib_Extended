00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:04.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
Today’s printed comments consider

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.556 line:10% position:50% align:center
how Satan has blurred

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:08.558 line:10% position:50% align:center
people’s view of Jehovah.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:11.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
Satan has blurred their view,

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
or blinded people, by means

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:15.565 line:10% position:50% align:center
of apostate teachings and by seeing to it

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:19.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s name has been removed
from many copies of the Bible.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this morning’s discussion,
we want to consider a related concern,

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:27.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is, What current
and future events in Satan’s world

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
could blur our view
of God’s Kingdom if we’re not careful?

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
With each point, we’ll tie in the principle

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in these words at Jeremiah 10:23,

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says:

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know, O Jehovah,

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that man’s way does not belong to him.

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:52.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not belong to man
who is walking even to direct his step.”

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this in mind, we’re going to look
at how widespread protests,

00:00:56.873 --> 00:01:01.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
political promises,
and claims of peace and security

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:05.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
could distort our view
of God’s Kingdom if we’re not careful.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:08.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
First is widespread protests.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
When protests sweep through any country,

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s often someone leading the way

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:17.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a very loud or persuasive voice, true?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their message
usually touches on something

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
that many see as an injustice.

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:27.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether the protest involves dozens,
hundreds, or thousands of people,

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of the protesters are followers,

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:33.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they repeat a message, or slogan.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
The problem is that the solutions they seek

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
are human solutions.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall Jeremiah’s words:

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man . . .
even to direct his step.”

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:50.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
What danger do such protests
pose for true Christians?

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:55.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
The danger is this: If we get caught up
in the spirit of popular protests

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:58.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even slightly supporting a cause,

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
even silently within our heart—

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:04.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could find our view
of God’s Kingdom growing dim.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
What, in turn, could that lead to?

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:10.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when people in the world
lack clear direction or hope,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
their hearts often start to be filled
with anger and rage.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
A servant of God can feel such things too

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he or she loses sight of the Kingdom.

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider for a moment what happened to those

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:28.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
who followed after King David’s son Absalom.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:33.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible explains that Absalom
objected to his father’s rulership,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he did more than that.

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:40.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through cunning words and actions,
he gathered a following.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can read about what he did

00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:46.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel 15:2-6.

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:49.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promised the people justice.

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 6 says that “Absalom kept stealing

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hearts of the men of Israel.”

00:02:55.291 --> 00:03:00.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
the people got caught up in his message.

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:03.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually,
those who joined him turned violent,

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the outcome was disastrous.

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:09.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even the hearts of those
who worship Jehovah

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be stolen, or captured,
or as today’s text says,

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘led astray’ for a misguided, or bad purpose.

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:22.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that is the danger,
and we can be certain that Satan knows it.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no question
that Satan is right now using

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
various messages of protest

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
to direct people away
from the real solution, God’s Kingdom.

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:35.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Satan will cast his net wide

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:39.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to capture
some of Jehovah’s people, if possible.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
To avoid that
and remain focused on the Kingdom,

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must not forget what Isaiah 42:1

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
promises about Jesus.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:52.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it foretells that
“he will bring justice to the nations”

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he will, not humans.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
As King of God’s Kingdom,

00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:02.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is the one who will bring
what sinful humans can never bring

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
—real justice for people.

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:09.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second thing
that can blur our view of the Kingdom

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re not careful is political promises.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there no end to the false promises

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people will make when they want power?

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:22.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even when politicians
try to fulfill some of their promises,

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
they often fall short on the wisdom
and the resources to do it effectively.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Political powers can only provide

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
short-term human solutions at best.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often cave in to popular
and immoral thinking.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their thoughts are so distorted

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:43.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they have difficulty
seeing right from wrong.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:47.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
They face long-term problems,
including social unrest,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they cannot permanently solve,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no amount of money can fix it for them.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we recall Jeremiah’s words:

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:59.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man . . .
even to direct his step.”

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the rulers of ancient Rome
tried to put down social unrest,

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
they gave many things to the people for free.

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:10.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Food, entertainment, and many services

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
were free or very cheap.

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:17.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
They called it “bread and circuses.”

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:22.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that was their formula to appease
the people and gain their allegiance.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like the governments of today,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
that man-made empire was in gradual decline.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:31.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the humans in charge
had no long-term answers,

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
only short-term offerings.

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s likely that the early Christians
in Rome and elsewhere benefited

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:42.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
from some of the things
that the empire provided:

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:46.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
food, water, good roads, and so forth.

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:50.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, those early Christians
needed to remain focused

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the Lord and on his promised Kingdom;

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
otherwise, their view of things
could have become distorted

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they might have been pulled
into compromising their faith

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving undue glory to the empire.

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
How shortsighted that would have been!

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:09.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
That empire in Rome would eventually,

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and did eventually,
turn against those Christians.

00:06:12.588 --> 00:06:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we too may benefit
from some of the things

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the nations are doing,
but like the early Christians,

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:21.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must never allow the Kingdom

00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:25.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become out of focus
in our minds and hearts.

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:27.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help us to do this?

00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re helped when we remember
that Jehovah and his Son

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in charge of man’s future.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:37.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
The solutions they offer are permanent.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:41.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
The promises
they have made will be fulfilled.

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:43.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we keep that focus,

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
then when this man-made system
turns against God’s people,

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:50.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will have no hold on us.

00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:53.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
As God’s Word directs,
we submit to man’s rulership

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it does not conflict with God’s rule.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in following that direction,

00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not entrusting our future
to political promises and favors.

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:07.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We entrust our future to God’s Kingdom alone.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more that the nations try to appease
the people through political promises,

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more determined we must be

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:19.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep the Kingdom in focus
as the real solution.

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
That leads us to the third thing
that could blur, or distort,

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:25.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
our view of God’s Kingdom, namely,

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:29.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the nations
are saying “peace and security.”

00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:33.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 5:3, God’s Word foretells

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:37.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “whenever it is
that they [the political powers] are saying,

00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:39.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:43.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them.”

00:07:43.146 --> 00:07:45.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why will sudden destruction come?

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:49.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because human governments
are not the solution.

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:52.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite having heard the Kingdom message,

00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:56.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
the nations will not stop trusting
in themselves to solve their problems.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
At some point,

00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:02.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
the political powers
will be arrogantly saying

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:04.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“peace and security” in a way

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fulfills 1 Thessalonians 5:3.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows how and when
that will prove to be.

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:15.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, no matter how much or how loudly

00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
the nations will be saying it,

00:08:18.214 --> 00:08:20.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
they cannot change this fact:

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:25.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man
who is walking even to direct his step.”

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as humans cannot
simply flap their arms and fly,

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:33.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
so, too, humans cannot
rule themselves successfully.

00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:37.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as things move ahead
toward the great tribulation,

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:41.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must not allow ourselves
to be fooled no matter how convincing

00:08:41.504 --> 00:08:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
the speeches and boasts
from the nations may sound.

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will not be fooled

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:50.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we refuse to get
caught up in popular protests

00:08:50.213 --> 00:08:53.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seek human solutions
to the world’s problems,

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:58.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we refuse to place
our trust in political promises,

00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:02.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if we refuse
to be fooled by the nations saying

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:05.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“peace and security.”

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no matter what Satan’s world
promotes in the news,

00:09:08.531 --> 00:09:11.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
on social media,
or elsewhere, we’re convinced

00:09:11.934 --> 00:09:15.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s Kingdom alone is the solution.

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do to keep that focus?

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:21.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep preaching
the good news of the Kingdom to people,

00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:25.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the warning about what is coming;

00:09:25.214 --> 00:09:28.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember that Jehovah and his Son

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the ones
who are in charge of man’s future;

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:34.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never allow Satan
and his world to weaken your faith

00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:37.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blur your view of God’s Kingdom.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And always have this in mind:

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s stated at Isaiah 26:3, 4,

00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:48.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says of Jehovah:

00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:51.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will safeguard
those who fully lean on you;

00:09:51.907 --> 00:09:54.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will give them continuous peace,

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because it is in you that they trust.

00:09:56.812 --> 00:09:59.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah forever,

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jah Jehovah is the eternal Rock.”
