00:00:01 Today’s printed comments consider
00:00:04 how Satan has blurred
00:00:06 people’s view of Jehovah.
00:00:08 Satan has blurred their view,
00:00:11 or blinded people, by means
00:00:12 of apostate teachings and by seeing to it
00:00:15 that God’s name has been removed from many copies of the Bible.
00:00:19 For this morning’s discussion, we want to consider a related concern,
00:00:23 and that is, What current and future events in Satan’s world
00:00:27 could blur our view of God’s Kingdom if we’re not careful?
00:00:32 With each point, we’ll tie in the principle
00:00:35 found in these words at Jeremiah 10:23,
00:00:40 where it says:
00:00:42 “I well know, O Jehovah,
00:00:44 “that man’s way does not belong to him.
00:00:47 It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”
00:00:53 With this in mind, we’re going to look at how widespread protests,
00:00:56 political promises, and claims of peace and security
00:01:01 could distort our view of God’s Kingdom if we’re not careful.
00:01:05 First is widespread protests.
00:01:08 When protests sweep through any country,
00:01:11 there’s often someone leading the way
00:01:13 with a very loud or persuasive voice, true?
00:01:17 And their message usually touches on something
00:01:20 that many see as an injustice.
00:01:22 Whether the protest involves dozens, hundreds, or thousands of people,
00:01:27 most of the protesters are followers,
00:01:29 and they repeat a message, or slogan.
00:01:33 The problem is that the solutions they seek
00:01:36 are human solutions.
00:01:39 Recall Jeremiah’s words:
00:01:41 “It does not belong to man . . . even to direct his step.”
00:01:46 What danger do such protests pose for true Christians?
00:01:50 The danger is this: If we get caught up in the spirit of popular protests
00:01:55 —even slightly supporting a cause,
00:01:58 even silently within our heart—
00:02:00 we could find our view of God’s Kingdom growing dim.
00:02:04 What, in turn, could that lead to?
00:02:06 Well, when people in the world lack clear direction or hope,
00:02:10 their hearts often start to be filled with anger and rage.
00:02:15 A servant of God can feel such things too
00:02:18 if he or she loses sight of the Kingdom.
00:02:22 Consider for a moment what happened to those
00:02:24 who followed after King David’s son Absalom.
00:02:28 The Bible explains that Absalom objected to his father’s rulership,
00:02:33 but he did more than that.
00:02:35 Through cunning words and actions, he gathered a following.
00:02:40 You can read about what he did
00:02:42 at 2 Samuel 15:2-6.
00:02:46 He promised the people justice.
00:02:49 And verse 6 says that “Absalom kept stealing
00:02:52 the hearts of the men of Israel.”
00:02:55 In other words, the people got caught up in his message.
00:03:00 Eventually, those who joined him turned violent,
00:03:03 and the outcome was disastrous.
00:03:05 Yes, even the hearts of those who worship Jehovah
00:03:09 can be stolen, or captured, or as today’s text says,
00:03:13 ‘led astray’ for a misguided, or bad purpose.
00:03:17 So that is the danger, and we can be certain that Satan knows it.
00:03:22 There’s no question that Satan is right now using
00:03:25 various messages of protest
00:03:27 to direct people away from the real solution, God’s Kingdom.
00:03:32 And Satan will cast his net wide
00:03:35 to try to capture some of Jehovah’s people, if possible.
00:03:40 To avoid that and remain focused on the Kingdom,
00:03:43 we must not forget what Isaiah 42:1
00:03:46 promises about Jesus.
00:03:48 There it foretells that “he will bring justice to the nations”
00:03:52 —he will, not humans.
00:03:55 As King of God’s Kingdom,
00:03:57 Jesus is the one who will bring what sinful humans can never bring
00:04:02 —real justice for people.
00:04:06 A second thing that can blur our view of the Kingdom
00:04:09 if we’re not careful is political promises.
00:04:12 Is there no end to the false promises
00:04:14 that people will make when they want power?
00:04:17 And even when politicians try to fulfill some of their promises,
00:04:22 they often fall short on the wisdom and the resources to do it effectively.
00:04:27 Political powers can only provide
00:04:29 short-term human solutions at best.
00:04:33 They often cave in to popular and immoral thinking.
00:04:37 Their thoughts are so distorted
00:04:40 that they have difficulty seeing right from wrong.
00:04:43 They face long-term problems, including social unrest,
00:04:47 that they cannot permanently solve,
00:04:50 and no amount of money can fix it for them.
00:04:53 Again, we recall Jeremiah’s words:
00:04:55 “It does not belong to man . . . even to direct his step.”
00:05:00 When the rulers of ancient Rome tried to put down social unrest,
00:05:04 they gave many things to the people for free.
00:05:07 Food, entertainment, and many services
00:05:10 were free or very cheap.
00:05:13 They called it “bread and circuses.”
00:05:17 See, that was their formula to appease the people and gain their allegiance.
00:05:22 But like the governments of today,
00:05:24 that man-made empire was in gradual decline.
00:05:28 And the humans in charge had no long-term answers,
00:05:31 only short-term offerings.
00:05:34 Now, it’s likely that the early Christians in Rome and elsewhere benefited
00:05:38 from some of the things that the empire provided:
00:05:42 food, water, good roads, and so forth.
00:05:46 Still, those early Christians needed to remain focused
00:05:50 on the Lord and on his promised Kingdom;
00:05:53 otherwise, their view of things could have become distorted
00:05:57 and they might have been pulled into compromising their faith
00:06:01 by giving undue glory to the empire.
00:06:04 How shortsighted that would have been!
00:06:06 That empire in Rome would eventually,
00:06:09 and did eventually, turn against those Christians.
00:06:12 Today, we too may benefit from some of the things
00:06:16 that the nations are doing, but like the early Christians,
00:06:19 we must never allow the Kingdom
00:06:21 to become out of focus in our minds and hearts.
00:06:25 What will help us to do this?
00:06:28 We’re helped when we remember that Jehovah and his Son
00:06:31 are in charge of man’s future.
00:06:34 The solutions they offer are permanent.
00:06:37 The promises they have made will be fulfilled.
00:06:41 If we keep that focus,
00:06:43 then when this man-made system turns against God’s people,
00:06:47 it will have no hold on us.
00:06:50 As God’s Word directs, we submit to man’s rulership
00:06:53 where it does not conflict with God’s rule.
00:06:56 But in following that direction,
00:06:58 we’re not entrusting our future to political promises and favors.
00:07:02 We entrust our future to God’s Kingdom alone.
00:07:07 The more that the nations try to appease the people through political promises,
00:07:12 the more determined we must be
00:07:15 to keep the Kingdom in focus as the real solution.
00:07:19 That leads us to the third thing that could blur, or distort,
00:07:22 our view of God’s Kingdom, namely,
00:07:25 when the nations are saying “peace and security.”
00:07:29 At 1 Thessalonians 5:3, God’s Word foretells
00:07:33 that “whenever it is that they [the political powers] are saying,
00:07:37 “‘Peace and security!’
00:07:39 then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them.”
00:07:43 Why will sudden destruction come?
00:07:45 Because human governments are not the solution.
00:07:49 Despite having heard the Kingdom message,
00:07:52 the nations will not stop trusting in themselves to solve their problems.
00:07:56 At some point,
00:07:58 the political powers will be arrogantly saying
00:08:02 “peace and security” in a way
00:08:04 that fulfills 1 Thessalonians 5:3.
00:08:07 Jehovah knows how and when that will prove to be.
00:08:12 Yet, no matter how much or how loudly
00:08:15 the nations will be saying it,
00:08:18 they cannot change this fact:
00:08:20 “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”
00:08:25 Just as humans cannot simply flap their arms and fly,
00:08:29 so, too, humans cannot rule themselves successfully.
00:08:33 So as things move ahead toward the great tribulation,
00:08:37 we must not allow ourselves to be fooled no matter how convincing
00:08:41 the speeches and boasts from the nations may sound.
00:08:44 And we will not be fooled
00:08:46 if we refuse to get caught up in popular protests
00:08:50 that seek human solutions to the world’s problems,
00:08:53 if we refuse to place our trust in political promises,
00:08:58 and if we refuse to be fooled by the nations saying
00:09:02 “peace and security.”
00:09:05 So no matter what Satan’s world promotes in the news,
00:09:08 on social media, or elsewhere, we’re convinced
00:09:11 that God’s Kingdom alone is the solution.
00:09:15 What can we do to keep that focus?
00:09:18 Keep preaching the good news of the Kingdom to people,
00:09:21 including the warning about what is coming;
00:09:25 remember that Jehovah and his Son
00:09:28 are the ones who are in charge of man’s future;
00:09:31 and never allow Satan and his world to weaken your faith
00:09:34 and blur your view of God’s Kingdom.
00:09:37 And always have this in mind:
00:09:39 it’s stated at Isaiah 26:3, 4,
00:09:45 where it says of Jehovah:
00:09:48 “You will safeguard those who fully lean on you;
00:09:51 “you will give them continuous peace,
00:09:54 “because it is in you that they trust.
00:09:56 “Trust in Jehovah forever,
00:09:59 for Jah Jehovah is the eternal Rock.”
