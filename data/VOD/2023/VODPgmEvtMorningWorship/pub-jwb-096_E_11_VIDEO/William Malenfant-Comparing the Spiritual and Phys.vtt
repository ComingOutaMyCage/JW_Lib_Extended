00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.319 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our theme is a very interesting one

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.321 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the spiritual man,

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
how he examines all things.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:10.760 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s the spirit of God that makes a Christian

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.663 line:10% position:50% align:center
into a person who stands out

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:16.232 line:10% position:50% align:center
as different from those

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:18.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are part of this world.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with that in mind,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
read with me 1 Corinthians 2:12.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, the scripture states:

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now we received,
not the spirit of the world,

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the spirit that is from God,

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we might know the things

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:41.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have been kindly given us by God.”

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:47.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spirit that we receive
from Jehovah God is his active force.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:51.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we really must have it
if we’re going to understand spiritual things

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if we’re going to appreciate the things

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah God has kindly given us,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the text states.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has Jehovah’s spirit opened the door

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:06.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kindly give you
and give me wonderful things?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom, the ransom,

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:12.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hope of everlasting life,

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new world, the resurrection

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these are things that the spirit
has revealed to Jehovah’s people.

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else that we’ve received
is the worldwide brotherhood

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
or, really, that we’re a part of.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you examine
the worldwide brotherhood,

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes very evident

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:36.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it could never exist

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:39.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
apart from Jehovah God’s spirit.

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
In no way could man
bring about such a brotherhood.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s read verse 13—1 Corinthians 2:13;

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “These things
[that is, the things he has given us]

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:58.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we also speak,
not with words taught by human wisdom,

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but with those taught by the spirit,

00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as we explain spiritual matters

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
with spiritual words.”

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
We focus on spiritual things.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sum total of human experience and wisdom

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:19.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
—its writings, philosophies, and teachings—
are as Jesus said,

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:22.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of no use at all”

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain everlasting life;

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s John 6:63.

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:31.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spiritual matters and spiritual words

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
are found right here
in God’s Word, the Bible.

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our vocabulary is different

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the world’s way of speaking,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is becoming
more and more vulgar and disgusting.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:49.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our speech centers on spiritual matters

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:51.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s will—

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:55.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so we explain the spiritual matters
that we understand from the Scriptures

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
with spiritual words.

00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the end,
we give glory to Jehovah by doing so.

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now let’s read verse 14.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says: “But a physical man

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not accept
the things of the spirit of God,

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for they are foolishness to him;

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he cannot get to know them,

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are examined spiritually.”

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:21.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it speaks of a physical man,

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not speaking
about a person with a fleshly body

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, after all,
all Christians living today on this earth

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
have fleshly bodies,

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:36.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it refers to a person
who has no spiritual side to his life.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are many
who fall into this category.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:43.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them are humanists,

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:47.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
who seem to be people
who really want to do what is good.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to help people.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their main pursuit is the welfare of people.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does that make them spiritual?

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:03.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual man knows
that to ‘love his neighbor as himself’

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the second commandment.

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:07.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the only thing they follow.

00:04:07.897 --> 00:04:12.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the main thing, the first commandment,
the most important one,

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:16.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to ‘love Jehovah God with your
whole heart, mind, soul, and strength.’

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:20.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is something
that the humanist does not follow.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about atheists,
agnostics, and evolutionists?

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:29.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we studied recently,
many people embrace evolution,

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because they have really studied things

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re convinced
by certain things they consider to be facts,

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
no, but they’ve been told by someone
that it’s true.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so they accept what they’ve been told.

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on the other hand, there are
dyed-in-the-wool atheists and evolutionists

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:47.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
who embrace theories

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if those theories they embrace
were applied

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
to any other discipline or aspect of life,

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would not be considered

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
anything but fantasy and wild imagination.

00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:03.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the truth.

00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some physical men ridicule believers in God

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:11.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say: “Well, your belief in God
is just a crutch.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t need a crutch.”

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:15.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you do need a crutch.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the truth of the matter.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re mortal.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us are mortal.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:22.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we need help in the sense

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need divine intervention,
help from Jehovah God.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he provides it
through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:34.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we understand why the physical man
acts the way he does.

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
He shuts his eyes
to the overwhelming facts of creation

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:42.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the obvious intelligent design of DNA;

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fine-tuning of the forces,

00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:49.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
the four forces evident in the universe;

00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
earth’s marvelous cycles that maintain it;

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:58.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
the precise placement
of the earth in the solar system;

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wonderful symbiotic relationships

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the plant and animal world;

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:07.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so much more that make it very obvious.

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:10.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
The wonderful, the marvelous, intelligence

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah God exhibits in creation.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:19.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as 1 Corinthians 2:14 says
(and we’ve read it):

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:21.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A physical man

00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not accept
the things of the spirit of God.”

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s interesting
is he looks at just the physical things,

00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet it’s the spirit of God
that created the wonderful physical things,

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:35.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s blind
because he can’t see beyond them.

00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:37.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like a man
who admires a beautiful painting,

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
a marvelous work of art,
and he purchases it for his home.

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:44.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he praises the artist.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he wants to see the scene,
or the site, where the artist did his work.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he goes to the mountains
where the lakes are,

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:53.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mountains are, the trees, the wildlife.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:56.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he observes these things,
and he is awestruck with their beauty.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:59.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he praises the artist.

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t say anything
about the one who did the original.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:05.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s blind.

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:09.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s how it is with a physical man.

00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:13.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 2:15, that verse says:

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However,
the spiritual man examines all things,

00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:21.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he himself is not examined by any man.”

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:26.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual man is not one who all day long

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:29.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
wears a sanctimonious, or religious,
expression on his face.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s not like a self-righteous Pharisee.

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:39.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual man is capable of admitting
when he makes a mistake.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
His first thought is not to save face,

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:46.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his first thought
is really to be honest and open.

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:50.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows his Creator
can see everything and knows everything.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:52.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are honest with ourselves and with others,

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we deal with situations with modesty.

00:07:56.659 --> 00:08:00.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is more, the spiritual man
is able to see the wrong position

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the physical man,
the course of the physical man.

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand the mental attitude
of the physical man.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know what makes him tick.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the physical man
does not understand the spiritual man.

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just for a brief explanation,

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 John 2:15-17

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:22.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which I won’t read at this time)

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:25.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives a very brief description

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:29.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the mental attitude
and outlook of the physical man.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fact that cannot be ignored,
also, is that Christendom’s churches

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:38.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as all religions
that are part of Babylon the Great

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:41.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
—with their unscriptural teachings,

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
unclean practices, and meddling in politics—

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
have played a major role

00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
in driving people away
from belief in the true God.

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:56.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a great responsibility
before Jehovah God

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:00.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the foolish,
ridiculous things they teach

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their activities that dishonor Jehovah.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:08.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have driven people
to atheism and agnosticism.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how good it is

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know the true God, Jehovah
—to have been drawn to him!

00:09:15.204 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you know the truth,
you have been drawn to Jehovah God

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:21.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
by his holy spirit,

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:26.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
his invisible power that is so evident
in all of creation

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
and particularly in his Word, the Bible.

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spiritual men and women

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:35.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
can see the unseen.

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know who created
the heavens and the earth

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that is in them

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our wonderful God, Jehovah.
