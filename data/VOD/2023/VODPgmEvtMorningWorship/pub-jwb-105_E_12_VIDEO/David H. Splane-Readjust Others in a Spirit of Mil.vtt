00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.732 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, God’s Word is so rich.

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:05.526 line:10% position:50% align:center
There’s so much in it,

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
and Galatians 6:1 is no exception.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.031 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, please, let’s turn there,

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read the whole thing.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.411 line:10% position:50% align:center
And then we’re going to analyze

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 6:1 phrase by phrase;

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a lot in this one verse.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at Galatians 6:1,

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul writes:

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brothers, even if a man
takes a false step

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“before he is aware of it,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you who have spiritual qualifications

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“try to readjust such a man
in a spirit of mildness.

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But keep an eye on yourself,

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
for fear you too may be tempted.”

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the first word is “brothers.”

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we notice that that is in the plural.

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
That may be significant, and we’re going to
come back to that in a few minutes.

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul says:
“even if a man takes a false step.”

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the metaphor here?

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Paul thinking about?

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Walking.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees a man who is walking down a path.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of a sudden, he “takes a false step.”

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, come to think of it,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
this isn’t the first time
that Paul mentions walking

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his letter to the Galatians.

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cast your eye on chapter 5,

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice verse 16:

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I say, Keep walking by spirit

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will carry out
no fleshly desire at all”;

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and again, verse 18:

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit,

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:52.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are not under law”;

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and once again, verse 25:

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we are living by spirit,

00:01:56.553 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us also go on
walking orderly by spirit”

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
—literally walking in a straight line;

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then at chapter 6, verse 1:

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“brothers, even if a man takes a false step.”

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul sees a Christian
who is walking along,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking in a straight line,

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all of a sudden, he takes a false step.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Question: Is one false step so serious?

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those of us who have tried
to walk down

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:34.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
the uneven pavement
on Columbia Heights

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have taken a false step

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:38.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we stepped off the curb

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wrenched something
or put something out,

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can testify
that one false step can be serious.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about you young brothers,
you basketball players?

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that sometimes
when you’re on the basketball court,

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
you take one false step

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you end up on crutches for a few weeks.

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the fact is that one false step
can be serious and, interestingly,

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:08.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Greek word
that’s translated “false step” here

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows for a variety of meanings.

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:14.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can apply to a minor infraction,

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it can also apply
to a major transgression

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a major sin.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll notice in the comment today
when we read it

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Galatians 6:1
is being applied to a serious sin.

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it can be applied to both.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s carry on.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “takes a false step
before he is aware of it.”

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Greek word here

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates that the sin is not deliberate.

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t leave home that day with the idea

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was going to commit a serious sin.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
It came upon him unawares.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was surprised.

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:56.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps he got into the wrong crowd,

00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of a sudden,
he ended up doing something

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he really hadn’t planned to do.

00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not deliberate,

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that doesn’t mean
that the sin isn’t serious.

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just means that it was not intentional.

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:15.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s help; help is on the way.

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “you who have
spiritual qualifications.”

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:23.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, come to think of it,
the Galatians would know what these are

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at chapter 5, verses 22, 23,

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul outlined

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
the nine aspects
of “the fruitage of the spirit,”

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:36.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they would know
what the spiritual qualifications are.

00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:40.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the point,
as Brother Devine brought out:

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:43.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who give counsel

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:46.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to be motivated by the holy spirit,

00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:50.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
not by frustration, not by anger.

00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is no knee-jerk reaction,

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
a flash of anger or something.

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the holy spirit

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:02.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to move us to give the counsel.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the next word is interesting.

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:08.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “You who have
spiritual qualifications try”

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:10.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“try.”

00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:12.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you won’t find that word in many Bibles.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:16.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think there’s only one other
besides the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
that says “try.”

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the Bible translations
follow the <i>King James Version</i>.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:25.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>King James Version</i>  says:
‘You who are spiritual restore the man.’

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Greek allows for both.

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows for an attempt,

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:33.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it can be a direct action.

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:36.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, now, the translators have to choose.

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:41.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original New World Bible
Translation Committee chose “try.”

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:48.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they realized that
while there would be an attempt to readjust,

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:51.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
the outcome would depend
on the person who was being readjusted.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:54.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he really want to change?

00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:57.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it would be successful,
and maybe it wouldn’t.

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps because Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:03.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
probably do more in giving counsel

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving help to people than anyone else,

00:06:05.928 --> 00:06:08.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
the translation committee
saw the subtlety

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:12.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 6:1.

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:14.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, we have a man walking along.

00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
He takes a false step.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can happen when you take a false step?

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may dislocate a bone.

00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us to the word “readjust.”

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:30.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Try to readjust such a man.”

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you probably know
that the word is a medical term

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
for setting a fractured bone in place.

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:39.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it works really well
with the metaphor, doesn’t it?

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:42.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re walking along, you take a false step,

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:46.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
something gets out of joint,
and now you have to be readjusted.

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:50.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bone has to be set in place.

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:54.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we come to
what Brother Devine was talking about:

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a spirit of mildness.”

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:00.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s good advice
because sometimes the elders are called upon

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counsel someone who has done something
that they find disgusting

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:10.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their emotions could get involved.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:14.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may feel like giving the person
a good tongue-lashing,

00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:15.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they don’t.

00:07:15.664 --> 00:07:17.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pray for holy spirit.

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:20.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s one of the aspects
of the holy spirit?

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mildness.

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:24.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pray for a spirit of mildness.

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, if the person
did something that bad,

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s probably thoroughly ashamed of himself,

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it may have taken every ounce of courage

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
that that person has
just to come to the elders.

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:40.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we deal with the person in kindness.

00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it says: “a spirit of mildness.”

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:48.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the next phrase is:
“But keep an eye on yourself”

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“yourself.”

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:54.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, that’s singular, isn’t it?

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:56.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Didn’t we say that
at the beginning of verse 1,

00:07:56.872 --> 00:08:00.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul addressed his “brothers”—plural?

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:03.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now he is addressing
each and every person

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was called upon to give counsel.

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:10.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Keep an eye on yourself.”

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this calls for a self-examination.

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:19.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure that many of us feel very similarly

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:21.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the comment that was given this morning.

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:25.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us who have given counsel for years

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:28.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
can look back with regret at times

00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:33.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
—at times when we should have been
more kind, more mild, in giving counsel.

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:37.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s good for us to undertake

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
a self-examination from time to time.

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:44.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How am I coming across in the counsel
that I’m giving to others?’

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:46.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
By using the singular,

00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:48.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is talking to each and every one of us.

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are an elder,

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:55.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is talking to you
and Paul is talking to me,

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:58.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s saying: “Examine yourself.

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:02.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Examine how your counsel is coming across.”

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:07.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
The final phrase is
“for fear you too may be tempted.”

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:10.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does Paul mean by that?

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is he saying that if you hear the details
of what the person has done,

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:16.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may want to do the same thing?

00:09:16.576 --> 00:09:20.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, what he’s reminding us of

00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:23.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we are all imperfect.

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:26.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is saying to us:
“Don’t get on your high horse.

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:29.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t be self-righteous
when you’re giving counsel to others.

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:32.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Remember, you are imperfect.

00:09:32.092 --> 00:09:35.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And one day, you could be sitting
on the other side of the table

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and receiving counsel.”

00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:40.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if that were the case,
how would you like to be treated?

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a spirit of mildness.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping our own limitations in mind

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to moderate our tone,

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:52.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak to the offender
in a spirit of mildness.

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:54.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s reread Galatians 6:1:

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brothers,

00:09:58.326 --> 00:10:02.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if a man takes a false step

00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“before he is aware of it,

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:09.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you who have spiritual qualifications

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:13.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“try to readjust such a man

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a spirit of mildness.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But keep an eye on yourself,

00:10:19.514 --> 00:10:23.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
for fear you too may be tempted.”

00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:26.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what can we take away
from this brief discussion?

00:10:26.605 --> 00:10:31.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we can just remember
that counsel must be given in mildness

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
by those who are moved by holy spirit,

00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:36.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
this discussion will have been worth having.
