00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:04.220 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s talk today

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.023 line:10% position:50% align:center
about unity a little bit

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:09.526 line:10% position:50% align:center
because oftentimes when people

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.529 line:10% position:50% align:center
refer to “the others,”

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.698 line:10% position:50% align:center
they reveal their biases.

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:17.500 line:10% position:50% align:center
Often, they want to demonstrate distance.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the contrary, Jesus here at John 10:16

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
uses the term “other sheep”
in connection with unity.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it at John 10:16.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:33.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus says here:
“And I have other sheep,

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which are not of this fold;
those too I must bring in,

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:40.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will listen to my voice,

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will become one flock,
one shepherd.”

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the anointed and those with a hope

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:52.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
of living forever on earth are united.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:56.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us talk, therefore, about unity

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
—unity and the Memorial.

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’d like to address
the following questions:

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:04.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is unity so precious for us personally?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are enemies to our unity?

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:09.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then as a third question,

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will attending the Memorial
help us to maintain our unity?

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why is unity
so precious for us personally?

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess we all treasure
the harmony in our family

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from applying God’s direction.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
The unity in the congregation
and Jehovah’s organization as a whole

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes us feel secure and protected.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
We receive comfort and encouragement

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we feel comfortable to open up.

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:41.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not fear that somebody

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
will take advantage of our vulnerable state.

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:49.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Psalm 122,

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:54.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
this precious unity
is described and illustrated.

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:59.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us read this at Psalm 122:3:

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jerusalem is built as a city

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:09.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is joined together as one.”

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:13.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
The houses in Jerusalem
were built close together,

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
forming a compact and easy-to-defend city.

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made it possible for the inhabitants

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help and protect one another.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, the unity we enjoy

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:32.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the frame in which
we can flourish and succeed.

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:35.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this unity
very valuable and precious to us?

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and we don’t take it for granted.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, unfortunately, this unity is fragile.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because there are enemies.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are these enemies?

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:50.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is our question number two.

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:53.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first of all, there is Satan.

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:58.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was able to destroy the unity
that existed between humans and Jehovah.

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he still does not want us

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
to succeed personally or as a group.

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since his frontal attacks
have not been successful,

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:12.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
he tries them from within
by employing all kinds of cunning.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, decades ago,

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:19.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
the state secret police in one country

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:23.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
launched heavy attacks
on different  responsible brothers

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of fake letters.

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:28.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
These brothers were accused
of being drunkards,

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:32.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
adulterers, and traitors.

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:36.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
In another country, the secret police
produced falsified copies of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
by twisting the contents
so as to serve Satan’s purpose.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:45.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan will continue to employ

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:50.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
similar tactics in the future
in an effort to destroy our precious unity.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today, he even has modern technology
at his disposal.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second enemy is the world.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live in Satan’s world,

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:05.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we cannot avoid
being exposed to its spirit.

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a spirit of independence

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a spirit that often promotes

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
so-called diversity that is abhorrent

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
—anything goes.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And tolerance has been redefined.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new tolerance means
believing another person’s position

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
is as valid or acceptable as your own.

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:31.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s not enough anymore

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:36.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just acknowledge the existence
of different views,

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you have to accept
the different views themselves.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since we live in this world,

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can easily see
that there exists the danger

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
that its spirit affects our precious unity.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about enemy number three?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enemy number three is we ourselves.

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:06.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can it be that we
who treasure unity so much

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
endanger it at the same time?

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s because we are imperfect,

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our mistakes can lead to division.

00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:19.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, Jehovah created us
with the wholesome inclination

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:21.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take care of ourselves.

00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:23.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, unfortunately, however,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is this tendency within us
to go overboard with it.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so pride and egotism

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:34.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
can develop and can easily disturb unity.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this brings us to our final question:

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will attending this year’s Memorial

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to maintain our precious unity?

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, attending our Memorial
certainly demonstrates

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:53.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
our full support of the anointed remnant.

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:55.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
The unity between the two groups

00:05:55.738 --> 00:06:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
was prophetically pictured
in Zechariah chapter 8.

00:06:00.543 --> 00:06:04.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read Zechariah 8:23,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
please note how close these two groups are.

00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Zechariah 8:23:

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘In those days, ten men
out of all the languages of the nations

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:22.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘will take hold, yes,

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘they will take firm hold
of the robe of a Jew, saying:

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“We want to go with you,

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:33.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
for we have heard
that God is with you people.”’”

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:39.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Taking a “firm hold of the robe”

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:43.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the desire to go together
is a clear sign of unity.

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
The members of the other sheep are proud
to associate with the anointed ones,

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that Jehovah is blessing them.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though in our congregation

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:56.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may not be one of the anointed ones,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are observing the Memorial
“shoulder to shoulder” with them.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
This renews our determination

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to fall prey
to any of the tactics of Satan.

00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we feed exclusively
at Jehovah’s table.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what sensational stories
are being told

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:20.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
or written about
or aired via social media platforms,

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:25.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
we fully trust and support
the Governing Body directed by Jesus.

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:30.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does attending the Memorial
help us to protect

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:32.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
our unity against “the spirit of the world”?

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we will focus on the ransom.

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus died for those who put faith in him

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:45.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and live according to Jehovah’s will.

00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:47.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
This separates us from those

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
who live according
to their own personal preferences.

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reflecting on Jesus’ ransom
helps us to set the right priorities?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:02.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
We put our own interests
and desires in second place.

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
We submit to Jehovah’s will.

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is our first priority;

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:10.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the key for maintaining our unity.

00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:14.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, during the Memorial,

00:08:14.377 --> 00:08:17.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
we focus on Jehovah’s main quality of love.

00:08:18.614 --> 00:08:22.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of love, Jehovah provided
the ransom sacrifice.

00:08:22.518 --> 00:08:27.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of love, Jesus paved the way
to forgiveness of our sins.

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love . . . is a perfect bond of union,”

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:37.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to Colossians 3:14.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:41.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love has the power to create unity.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
The unity between Jehovah and Jesus
is the greatest example,

00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:50.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to maintain the same unity today.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we fight selfish tendencies.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, we prove our love

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:58.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
by our generosity and practical help.

00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:01.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not spread rumors or gossip,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we protect one another.

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so,

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:11.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
we keep the damaging effects
of our imperfect personality under control.
