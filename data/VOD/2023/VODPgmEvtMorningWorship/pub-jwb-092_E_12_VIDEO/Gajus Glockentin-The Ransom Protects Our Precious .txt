00:00:01 Now, let’s talk today
00:00:04 about unity a little bit
00:00:07 because oftentimes when people
00:00:09 refer to “the others,”
00:00:12 they reveal their biases.
00:00:14 Often, they want to demonstrate distance.
00:00:17 On the contrary, Jesus here at John 10:16
00:00:22 uses the term “other sheep” in connection with unity.
00:00:27 Let’s read it at John 10:16.
00:00:30 Jesus says here: “And I have other sheep,
00:00:33 “which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in,
00:00:37 “and they will listen to my voice,
00:00:40 and they will become one flock, one shepherd.”
00:00:45 So the anointed and those with a hope
00:00:48 of living forever on earth are united.
00:00:52 Let us talk, therefore, about unity
00:00:56 —unity and the Memorial.
00:00:58 And we’d like to address the following questions:
00:01:00 Why is unity so precious for us personally?
00:01:04 What are enemies to our unity?
00:01:07 And then as a third question,
00:01:09 How will attending the Memorial help us to maintain our unity?
00:01:14 So why is unity so precious for us personally?
00:01:16 I guess we all treasure the harmony in our family
00:01:20 that comes from applying God’s direction.
00:01:23 The unity in the congregation and Jehovah’s organization as a whole
00:01:28 makes us feel secure and protected.
00:01:32 We receive comfort and encouragement
00:01:35 because we feel comfortable to open up.
00:01:38 We do not fear that somebody
00:01:41 will take advantage of our vulnerable state.
00:01:46 In Psalm 122,
00:01:49 this precious unity is described and illustrated.
00:01:54 Let us read this at Psalm 122:3:
00:02:01 “Jerusalem is built as a city
00:02:05 that is joined together as one.”
00:02:09 The houses in Jerusalem were built close together,
00:02:13 forming a compact and easy-to-defend city.
00:02:17 This made it possible for the inhabitants
00:02:20 to help and protect one another.
00:02:24 In other words, the unity we enjoy
00:02:27 is the frame in which we can flourish and succeed.
00:02:32 Isn’t this unity very valuable and precious to us?
00:02:35 Yes, and we don’t take it for granted.
00:02:38 Now, unfortunately, this unity is fragile.
00:02:42 Why?
00:02:43 Because there are enemies.
00:02:45 What are these enemies?
00:02:48 That is our question number two.
00:02:50 Now, first of all, there is Satan.
00:02:53 He was able to destroy the unity that existed between humans and Jehovah.
00:02:58 And he still does not want us
00:03:00 to succeed personally or as a group.
00:03:05 Since his frontal attacks have not been successful,
00:03:08 he tries them from within by employing all kinds of cunning.
00:03:12 For example, decades ago,
00:03:16 the state secret police in one country
00:03:19 launched heavy attacks on different  responsible brothers
00:03:23 by means of fake letters.
00:03:25 These brothers were accused of being drunkards,
00:03:28 adulterers, and traitors.
00:03:32 In another country, the secret police produced falsified copies of The Watchtower
00:03:36 by twisting the contents so as to serve Satan’s purpose.
00:03:42 Satan will continue to employ
00:03:45 similar tactics in the future in an effort to destroy our precious unity.
00:03:50 And today, he even has modern technology at his disposal.
00:03:56 Now, the second enemy is the world.
00:03:59 We live in Satan’s world,
00:04:01 and we cannot avoid being exposed to its spirit.
00:04:05 It’s a spirit of independence
00:04:08 and a spirit that often promotes
00:04:10 so-called diversity that is abhorrent
00:04:14 —anything goes.
00:04:17 And tolerance has been redefined.
00:04:20 The new tolerance means believing another person’s position
00:04:25 is as valid or acceptable as your own.
00:04:29 So it’s not enough anymore
00:04:31 to just acknowledge the existence of different views,
00:04:36 but you have to accept the different views themselves.
00:04:43 Since we live in this world,
00:04:46 we can easily see that there exists the danger
00:04:49 that its spirit affects our precious unity.
00:04:55 Now, what about enemy number three?
00:04:58 Enemy number three is we ourselves.
00:05:01 How can it be that we who treasure unity so much
00:05:06 endanger it at the same time?
00:05:09 Now, it’s because we are imperfect,
00:05:12 and our mistakes can lead to division.
00:05:15 For instance, Jehovah created us with the wholesome inclination
00:05:19 to take care of ourselves.
00:05:21 Now, unfortunately, however,
00:05:23 there is this tendency within us to go overboard with it.
00:05:28 And so pride and egotism
00:05:31 can develop and can easily disturb unity.
00:05:36 Now, this brings us to our final question:
00:05:39 How will attending this year’s Memorial
00:05:42 help us to maintain our precious unity?
00:05:47 Now, attending our Memorial certainly demonstrates
00:05:50 our full support of the anointed remnant.
00:05:53 The unity between the two groups
00:05:55 was prophetically pictured in Zechariah chapter 8.
00:06:00 As we read Zechariah 8:23,
00:06:04 please note how close these two groups are.
00:06:08 This is Zechariah 8:23:
00:06:12 “This is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:06:15 “‘In those days, ten men out of all the languages of the nations
00:06:19 “‘will take hold, yes,
00:06:22 “‘they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew, saying:
00:06:27 “‘“We want to go with you,
00:06:30 for we have heard that God is with you people.”’”
00:06:35 Taking a “firm hold of the robe”
00:06:39 and the desire to go together is a clear sign of unity.
00:06:43 The members of the other sheep are proud to associate with the anointed ones,
00:06:48 knowing that Jehovah is blessing them.
00:06:50 So even though in our congregation
00:06:53 there may not be one of the anointed ones,
00:06:56 we are observing the Memorial “shoulder to shoulder” with them.
00:07:02 This renews our determination
00:07:05 not to fall prey to any of the tactics of Satan.
00:07:09 That is why we feed exclusively at Jehovah’s table.
00:07:13 No matter what sensational stories are being told
00:07:16 or written about or aired via social media platforms,
00:07:20 we fully trust and support the Governing Body directed by Jesus.
00:07:27 Now, how does attending the Memorial help us to protect
00:07:30 our unity against “the spirit of the world”?
00:07:33 Now we will focus on the ransom.
00:07:37 Jesus died for those who put faith in him
00:07:40 and live according to Jehovah’s will.
00:07:45 This separates us from those
00:07:47 who live according to their own personal preferences.
00:07:51 And isn’t it true
00:07:53 that reflecting on Jesus’ ransom helps us to set the right priorities?
00:07:57 We put our own interests and desires in second place.
00:08:02 We submit to Jehovah’s will.
00:08:04 This is our first priority;
00:08:06 this is the key for maintaining our unity.
00:08:12 Additionally, during the Memorial,
00:08:14 we focus on Jehovah’s main quality of love.
00:08:18 Out of love, Jehovah provided the ransom sacrifice.
00:08:22 Out of love, Jesus paved the way to forgiveness of our sins.
00:08:28 “Love . . . is a perfect bond of union,”
00:08:33 according to Colossians 3:14.
00:08:37 Love has the power to create unity.
00:08:41 The unity between Jehovah and Jesus is the greatest example,
00:08:46 and we want to maintain the same unity today.
00:08:50 Therefore, we fight selfish tendencies.
00:08:53 For example, we prove our love
00:08:55 by our generosity and practical help.
00:08:58 We do not spread rumors or gossip,
00:09:01 but we protect one another.
00:09:04 By doing so,
00:09:06 we keep the damaging effects of our imperfect personality under control.
00:09:13 So in summary,
00:09:15 our unity is truly special and precious
00:09:18 and we are protected.
00:09:21 We all have the responsibility
00:09:23 to defend our unity against the influences of Satan,
00:09:27 the world,  and our imperfect personalities.
00:09:32 Attending the Memorial will be a special opportunity
00:09:35 to demonstrate full trust and support for the anointed remnant.
00:09:40 We will be motivated
00:09:42 to continue submitting to Jehovah’s will
00:09:46 and imitating Jehovah’s and Jesus’ love.
