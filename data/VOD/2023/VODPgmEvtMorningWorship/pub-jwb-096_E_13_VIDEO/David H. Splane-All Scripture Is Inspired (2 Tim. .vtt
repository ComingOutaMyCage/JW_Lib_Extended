00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:04.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.390 line:10% position:50% align:center
is inspired of God.”

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s stop right there

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
and unpack that statement,

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:16.900 line:10% position:50% align:center
because there’s a lot to unpack.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take the last part first,
“inspired of God.”

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:24.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know what that means.

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:27.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that God put his thoughts

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:29.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the mind of man,

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then men wrote them down.

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:34.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what that means.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, when you tell a householder
from house-to-house

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible is inspired by God,

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:44.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
does the householder
necessarily know what you mean?

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not necessarily.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:53.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the word “inspired”
is thrown around rather casually today.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:59.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This motion picture
was inspired by real events.”

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
God is not in the picture.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
A poet or a songwriter

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
is inspired by a sunset.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so if the householder
doesn’t have a strong Bible background,

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not likely
that he understands what you mean

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you say
that the Bible is inspired by God.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll have to explain that the Bible

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
is God’s thoughts about men

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not man’s thoughts about God.

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we’re going to spend most of our time
on the first part of our text,

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:34.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all Scripture.”

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have to ask,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Paul and the other Bible writers

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the early Christians
in the first century—?

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:45.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they determine

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
which writings were inspired

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and which were not?

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’ll examine three Bible texts
that illustrate the problem.

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:59.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to Luke 1:1.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:06.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our goal in reading this text

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to see if there is
a problem with determining

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether a writing is inspired or not.

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 1:1, Luke writes:

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Seeing that many have undertaken

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:25.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
to compile an account of the facts
that are given full credence among us.”

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Luke saying?

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many gospels
of Jesus Christ in the first century,

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet only four of them
were accepted as inspired.

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:40.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how was that determined?

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the Christians
put a bunch of manuscripts on the table

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:46.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say, “Oh, I like this one;
this one, not so much”?

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
That wouldn’t be
a very good way to determine

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
which books were canonical or not.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:57.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as a second illustration, or example,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians

00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:05.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not Paul’s
first letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:09.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ll turn to 1 Corinthians 5:9,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see what I mean.

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 5:9,

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:28.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
here Paul writes
in his first letter to the Corinthians:

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In my letter I wrote you

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:36.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stop keeping company
with sexually immoral people.”

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there was a previous letter

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
before what we now call
Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:45.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess if you want to be picky,
you would call this one

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:50.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s first inspired letter
to the Corinthians.

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:53.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, that previous letter
was never accepted

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:55.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
as part of the Bible canon.

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:56.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:58.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it a good letter?

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:00.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt it was.

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:03.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it accurate in every way?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe not.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t inspired.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:13.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why do we say maybe not?

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>Insight</i>
made a very interesting comment

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:18.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the writings of Bible writers

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they were not writing under inspiration.

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:23.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
And speaking of these writings,

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight </i> says
that they “may have reflected to some degree

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the incomplete understanding
that existed in the early years

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Christian congregation.”

00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:36.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if someone was just writing for himself,

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
writing a letter
to some congregation or some brother—

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:43.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe the disciple James
was writing to someone early on

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the decision of circumcision was made,

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said, ‘Well, it’s probably best

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Gentile Christians to be circumcised.’

00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:54.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
He might have said something like that.

00:04:54.677 --> 00:04:57.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, of course,
when the decision was made

00:04:57.013 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the influence of holy spirit,

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
James would have written and spoken
in harmony with holy spirit.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, his letter
—the letter of James—

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
was written under inspiration.

00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:12.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when Bible writers were inspired,

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:17.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
their letters and their writings
were without error.

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for one last example,
turn to Colossians 4:16.

00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul writes:
“And when this letter

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:43.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been read among you,

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“arrange for it also to be read

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the congregation of the Laodiceans

00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:53.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for you also to read
the one from Laodicea.”

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
The letter to the Colossians, inspired.

00:05:57.373 --> 00:06:01.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
The letter to the Laodiceans, not inspired.

00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:05.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how was the decision made?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Catholic Church claims
that the so-called fathers of the church

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
made the decision that they are the ones
who compiled the Bible canon

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:19.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Council of Carthage in 397 C.E.,

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the decision was made much,
much earlier than that.

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have a clue
when we read Peter’s words

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Peter chapter 3

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 16.

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:39.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often read this verse for another reason,

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let’s read 2 Peter 3:16

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
and think about the Bible canon.

00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:48.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here Peter is talking about Paul,

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he says:
“Speaking about these things

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he does in all his letters.”

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:59.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Peter here
is writing in the year 64 C.E.

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that means that at least

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
13 of Paul’s 14 letters

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
had already been circulated.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:11.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he talked about Paul writing
in all his letters.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, some things in them
are hard to understand,

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and these things
the ignorant and unstable are twisting,

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:24.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.”

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here already in the year 64 C.E.,

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:31.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
a decision had been made

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Paul’s letters
were part of the Scriptures.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:40.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we haven’t answered the question.

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep asking the question,
but we haven’t answered it.

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:47.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is found
at 1 Corinthians chapter 12

00:07:51.787 --> 00:07:53.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 10.

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember our point in reading this.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re looking for the way in which Christians

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to determine in the first century

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:07.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
which Bible books and letters were inspired

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and which were not.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:12.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul is talking
about the gifts of the spirit here,

00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:15.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he says that there was given
“to yet another

00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:18.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
“operations of powerful works,

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:20.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to another prophesying,

00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:24.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to another discernment

00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:28.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
of inspired expressions.”

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certain Christians in the first century

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a miraculous gift of the spirit

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:39.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
that allowed them to determine, to discern,

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:44.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
which writings were inspired
and which were not,

00:08:44.173 --> 00:08:47.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is how the Bible canon
came together.

00:08:47.677 --> 00:08:51.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you think of it,
it really makes sense, doesn’t it?
