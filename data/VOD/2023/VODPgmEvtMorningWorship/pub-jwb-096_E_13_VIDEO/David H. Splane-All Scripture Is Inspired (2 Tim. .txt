00:00:01 “All Scripture
00:00:04 is inspired of God.”
00:00:08 Now, let’s stop right there
00:00:11 and unpack that statement,
00:00:13 because there’s a lot to unpack.
00:00:16 Let’s take the last part first, “inspired of God.”
00:00:21 Now, you know what that means.
00:00:24 It means that God put his thoughts
00:00:27 into the mind of man,
00:00:29 and then men wrote them down.
00:00:32 You know what that means.
00:00:34 But now, when you tell a householder from house-to-house
00:00:38 that the Bible is inspired by God,
00:00:40 does the householder necessarily know what you mean?
00:00:44 Not necessarily.
00:00:47 Why not?
00:00:48 Because the word “inspired” is thrown around rather casually today.
00:00:54 “This motion picture was inspired by real events.”
00:01:00 God is not in the picture.
00:01:02 A poet or a songwriter
00:01:05 is inspired by a sunset.
00:01:09 And so if the householder doesn’t have a strong Bible background,
00:01:13 it’s not likely that he understands what you mean
00:01:16 when you say that the Bible is inspired by God.
00:01:18 And you’ll have to explain that the Bible
00:01:21 is God’s thoughts about men
00:01:23 and not man’s thoughts about God.
00:01:27 But now we’re going to spend most of our time on the first part of our text,
00:01:31 “all Scripture.”
00:01:34 And we have to ask,
00:01:37 How did Paul and the other Bible writers
00:01:40 and the early Christians in the first century—?
00:01:43 How did they determine
00:01:45 which writings were inspired
00:01:47 and which were not?
00:01:50 Now, we’ll examine three Bible texts that illustrate the problem.
00:01:54 Let’s turn to Luke 1:1.
00:02:00 I’ll give you a moment.
00:02:03 And our goal in reading this text
00:02:06 is to see if there is a problem with determining
00:02:10 whether a writing is inspired or not.
00:02:13 At Luke 1:1, Luke writes:
00:02:16 “Seeing that many have undertaken
00:02:21 to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence among us.”
00:02:26 What is Luke saying?
00:02:28 There were many gospels of Jesus Christ in the first century,
00:02:32 and yet only four of them were accepted as inspired.
00:02:37 Now, how was that determined?
00:02:40 Did the Christians put a bunch of manuscripts on the table
00:02:43 and say, “Oh, I like this one; this one, not so much”?
00:02:46 That wouldn’t be a very good way to determine
00:02:49 which books were canonical or not.
00:02:52 Now, as a second illustration, or example,
00:02:57 Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians
00:03:00 was not Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians.
00:03:06 If you’ll turn to 1 Corinthians 5:9,
00:03:09 you’ll see what I mean.
00:03:20 At 1 Corinthians 5:9,
00:03:23 here Paul writes in his first letter to the Corinthians:
00:03:28 “In my letter I wrote you
00:03:31 to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people.”
00:03:36 So there was a previous letter
00:03:39 before what we now call Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians.
00:03:42 I guess if you want to be picky, you would call this one
00:03:45 Paul’s first inspired letter to the Corinthians.
00:03:50 But now, that previous letter was never accepted
00:03:53 as part of the Bible canon.
00:03:55 Why not?
00:03:56 Was it a good letter?
00:03:58 No doubt it was.
00:04:00 Was it accurate in every way?
00:04:03 Maybe.
00:04:05 Maybe not.
00:04:07 It wasn’t inspired.
00:04:10 Now, why do we say maybe not?
00:04:13 Well, Insight made a very interesting comment
00:04:15 about the writings of Bible writers
00:04:18 when they were not writing under inspiration.
00:04:21 And speaking of these writings,
00:04:23 Insight  says that they “may have reflected to some degree
00:04:27 “the incomplete understanding that existed in the early years
00:04:31 of the Christian congregation.”
00:04:33 So if someone was just writing for himself,
00:04:36 writing a letter to some congregation or some brother—
00:04:38 Maybe the disciple James was writing to someone early on
00:04:43 before the decision of circumcision was made,
00:04:46 and he said, ‘Well, it’s probably best
00:04:49 for Gentile Christians to be circumcised.’
00:04:52 He might have said something like that.
00:04:54 But then, of course, when the decision was made
00:04:57 under the influence of holy spirit,
00:04:59 James would have written and spoken in harmony with holy spirit.
00:05:03 And, of course, his letter —the letter of James—
00:05:06 was written under inspiration.
00:05:08 So when Bible writers were inspired,
00:05:12 their letters and their writings were without error.
00:05:18 Now, for one last example, turn to Colossians 4:16.
00:05:38 And Paul writes: “And when this letter
00:05:41 “has been read among you,
00:05:43 “arrange for it also to be read
00:05:45 “in the congregation of the Laodiceans
00:05:48 and for you also to read the one from Laodicea.”
00:05:54 The letter to the Colossians, inspired.
00:05:57 The letter to the Laodiceans, not inspired.
00:06:01 Well, how was the decision made?
00:06:07 Now, the Catholic Church claims that the so-called fathers of the church
00:06:11 made the decision that they are the ones who compiled the Bible canon
00:06:14 at the Council of Carthage in 397 C.E.,
00:06:19 but the decision was made much, much earlier than that.
00:06:24 And we have a clue when we read Peter’s words
00:06:27 at 2 Peter chapter 3
00:06:32 and verse 16.
00:06:35 We often read this verse for another reason,
00:06:39 but let’s read 2 Peter 3:16
00:06:42 and think about the Bible canon.
00:06:45 And here Peter is talking about Paul,
00:06:48 and he says: “Speaking about these things
00:06:51 as he does in all his letters.”
00:06:54 Now, Peter here is writing in the year 64 C.E.
00:06:59 And that means that at least
00:07:01 13 of Paul’s 14 letters
00:07:04 had already been circulated.
00:07:06 So he talked about Paul writing in all his letters.
00:07:11 “However, some things in them are hard to understand,
00:07:15 “and these things the ignorant and unstable are twisting,
00:07:19 as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.”
00:07:24 So here already in the year 64 C.E.,
00:07:27 a decision had been made
00:07:31 that Paul’s letters were part of the Scriptures.
00:07:35 How?
00:07:37 Well, we haven’t answered the question.
00:07:40 We keep asking the question, but we haven’t answered it.
00:07:43 The answer is found at 1 Corinthians chapter 12
00:07:51 and verse 10.
00:07:54 And remember our point in reading this.
00:07:57 We’re looking for the way in which Christians
00:08:00 were able to determine in the first century
00:08:03 which Bible books and letters were inspired
00:08:07 and which were not.
00:08:09 So Paul is talking about the gifts of the spirit here,
00:08:12 and he says that there was given “to yet another
00:08:15 “operations of powerful works,
00:08:18 “to another prophesying,
00:08:20 “to another discernment
00:08:24 of inspired expressions.”
00:08:28 Certain Christians in the first century
00:08:32 had a miraculous gift of the spirit
00:08:35 that allowed them to determine, to discern,
00:08:39 which writings were inspired and which were not,
00:08:44 and that is how the Bible canon came together.
00:08:47 And when you think of it, it really makes sense, doesn’t it?
00:08:51 Holy spirit guided the writing of the Bible,
00:08:55 and holy spirit
00:08:57 guided the collection of the inspired writings together
00:09:02 into what we now know as “all Scripture.”
00:09:06 “All Scripture is inspired of God.”
