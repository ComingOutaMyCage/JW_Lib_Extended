00:00:01 Most likely when we speak to our brothers and our sisters,
00:00:04 our friends, our family,
00:00:06 it seems like everyone
00:00:07 is going through something stressful,
00:00:09 something that’s causing them anxiety.
00:00:11 If it’s not us, it could be our mate.
00:00:14 It could be a close friend.
00:00:15 It could be our parents.
00:00:17 It could be anyone that we’re close to.
00:00:19 This causes worry.
00:00:20 It causes anxiety.
00:00:22 We get stressed out over the stress.
00:00:25 What can we do?
00:00:27 We can be like David.
00:00:28 What did David do?
00:00:30 Open your Bibles to Psalm 18:6.
00:00:35 David did not rely on himself.
00:00:37 He turned to his best Friend and his Rescuer, Jehovah.
00:00:41 Psalm 18:6 reads:
00:00:44 “In my distress I called on Jehovah,
00:00:48 “to my God I kept crying for help.
00:00:50 “From his temple he heard my voice,
00:00:54 and my cry to him for help reached his ears.”
00:00:57 And verse 16 goes on to say in response:
00:01:01 “[Jehovah] reached down from on high;
00:01:03 “he took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.
00:01:08 “He rescued me from my strong enemy,
00:01:11 from those hating me, who were stronger than I was.”
00:01:16 Well, it’s comforting to read what David went through
00:01:18 and how Jehovah helped him.
00:01:21 And it’s comforting that Jehovah promises to do the same for you, for me,
00:01:24 and for all of his loyal servants.
00:01:27 Now, in the past, Jehovah used angels
00:01:29 —he dispatched them, he sent them—
00:01:31 to help loyal ones like Jacob,
00:01:35 Gideon, Daniel, Mary, and Jesus.
00:01:39 Now, we still have angels helping us today.
00:01:42 But who does Jehovah use primarily to help his servants on earth?
00:01:47 You, me, and our brotherhood.
00:01:50 And what a privilege it is to be used by Jehovah,
00:01:53 to be dispatched by Jehovah, to be an aid to someone else!
00:01:58 But we need to ask ourselves:
00:02:01 ‘Am I someone who is ready to be used?
00:02:04 ‘Am I willing to be used by Jehovah?
00:02:06 ‘Am I willing to be dispatched
00:02:08 when someone is going through difficult times?’
00:02:12 Picture, if you will, a young man swimming in the ocean.
00:02:16 He’s doing fine until he comes into distress.
00:02:20 He begins yelling out to be rescued.
00:02:23 Thankfully, an alert lifeguard is there.
00:02:26 He dives into the ocean;
00:02:28 he plunges in and brings this person to safety.
00:02:33 Now, lifeguards are there for a reason.
00:02:35 They’re there to warn people of danger.
00:02:38 But if they’re in danger, they pull them to safety.
00:02:41 We expect that a lifeguard would do that.
00:02:45 What does Jehovah expect of us?
00:02:49 Well, he trains us to protect others
00:02:52 —to be a lifesaver, a lifeguard,
00:02:55 for other brothers and sisters who are desperately needing help.
00:03:00 In a similar way, we need to think about others.
00:03:03 We need to be observant like a lifeguard
00:03:06 and see if they might be drowning in sorrow
00:03:09 or in some sort of distress
00:03:11 and see what we can do to come to their rescue.
00:03:14 And what can we do?
00:03:15 Follow today’s text at Proverbs 17:17.
00:03:19 Let’s read it in its entirety.
00:03:22 It says: “A true friend
00:03:25 “shows love at all times
00:03:28 and is a brother who is born for times of distress.”
00:03:33 So, what does that mean?
00:03:34 “A true friend shows love at all times.”
00:03:39 A true friend is not one who makes your problems disappear.
00:03:43 A true friend is the one who won’t disappear
00:03:46 when you’re facing problems.
00:03:48 That’s a true friend.
00:03:50 When David was going through very difficult times, many abandoned him
00:03:55 —but not Jonathan, not Hushai.
00:03:58 They were there. They were loyal.
00:04:00 They were true friends through thick and thin.
00:04:02 They were there to assist David,
00:04:05 to rescue him when he needed rescuing the most.
00:04:09 Yes, they stood by David
00:04:12 when he needed to lean on them.
00:04:15 Love was the very foundation of their friendship.
00:04:18 Love was enduring.
00:04:20 Love was strong.
00:04:22 Now, think about lifeguards, going back to our illustration.
00:04:26 Lifeguards are not born lifeguards.
00:04:28 They are trained to do so
00:04:30 —to be observant, to come to the rescue of others.
00:04:33 Jehovah is training us now.
00:04:36 We need to use that training to help others.
00:04:41 We need to be observant.
00:04:42 We need to be on the lookout to come to their rescue.
00:04:46 And when you think about true friends, they know us very well.
00:04:50 Even if we don’t say anything to them, they are observant.
00:04:54 They know if we’re going through a difficult time just by a look
00:04:57 or maybe our tone of voice or possibly our demeanor.
00:05:01 They come to our rescue.
00:05:05 Jesus said at John 15:13
00:05:08 that “no one has greater love than this, [and what is this?]
00:05:12 “that someone should surrender his life
00:05:15 in behalf of his friends.”
00:05:18 Now, we know that our friends are willing to sacrifice for us,
00:05:22 and at some point, sometimes it could mean
00:05:26 that we would die for our friends.
00:05:28 But likely what it means is that we are surrendering,
00:05:31 giving up, sacrificing our time and our energy
00:05:35 to come to the aid of others,
00:05:37 to build them up spiritually,
00:05:39 help them physically and sometimes even emotionally.
00:05:44 Because love is the very foundation, it’s enduring.
00:05:48 It never, ever fails.
00:05:51 Now, sometimes we want to come to the aid of others,
00:05:54 but we don’t know what to say.
00:05:56 We may not know what to do.
00:05:58 We can’t fix their problem.
00:05:59 We can’t take it away.
00:06:01 But we can come to their aid and be with them,
00:06:05 be there for them, be at their side.
00:06:07 Sometimes just being a good listener
00:06:09 —that’s true love.
00:06:13 The smallest act of kindness
00:06:15 is worth far more than the grandest intention.
00:06:20 And we need to remember that.
00:06:22 Remember, Jehovah expects us
00:06:25 to be genuine and self-sacrificing
00:06:29 in our love at all times for others.
00:06:34 Unexpected events happen at unexpected times.
00:06:39 So we need to ask ourselves,
00:06:41 ‘Am I ready to give of myself and put things aside
00:06:44 and jump into action to help my brother or sister?’
00:06:50 Interestingly, the second part of verse 17 says
00:06:54 “a brother who is born for times of distress.”
00:06:59 How are we to understand that part of the scripture?
00:07:02 Well, it could mean a brother or sister
00:07:04 who is our fleshly brother or sister,
00:07:06 but many times, it’s not.
00:07:09 It could be a brother or sister spiritually who has come to our aid
00:07:13 —someone who is a true friend, someone who is loyal.
00:07:17 That’s what Proverbs 18:24 says,
00:07:19 that ‘a true friend is sticking closer than a brother.’
00:07:24 We have the opportunity to be used by Jehovah
00:07:27 —to be an answer to someone’s prayer
00:07:30 if we allow ourselves to be used by Jehovah to make ourselves available
00:07:35 and “dive in” to come to the rescue of others.
00:07:39 And quite likely we’re going to go through a distressful time,
00:07:43 and we’ll need someone to be an answer to our prayer.
00:07:48 A true friend is one who walks into your life
00:07:52 when others are walking out.
00:07:54 They enter; they come into our life when we need them most,
00:07:57 like the case of David.
00:08:00 We might be good at coming to the rescue right away
00:08:04 when something happens in someone’s life.
00:08:05 But what would happen if that illness or that issue
00:08:09 is prolonged and it goes on and on?
00:08:12 Will we still stick to our brother and our sister
00:08:16 and be there for them in their time of distress?
00:08:20 Well, we want to continue to keep in contact with them
00:08:23 to assure them of Jehovah’s love and our love by a note,
00:08:28 an email, a text, or by visiting them.
00:08:31 All of these will assure them that they are truly loved.
00:08:35 When we think about Paul, the apostle Paul,
00:08:38 he went through many distressful times.
00:08:41 In fact, when he was in Rome in the year 60 C.E., he was imprisoned.
00:08:46 He mentioned by name in the book of Colossians, in chapter 4,
00:08:50 five brothers —five friends—
00:08:53 that came to his rescue.
00:08:55 They were brothers born for when he was going through distress.
00:08:59 Yes, they entered into his life when he needed them most.
00:09:04 We recall they were called Tychicus,
00:09:08 Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus.
00:09:13 And what did Paul say in Colossians 4:11 about them?
00:09:17 He said: “They have become a source of great comfort to me,”
00:09:21 or as the footnote says, “a strengthening aid.”
00:09:26 It’s interesting that “a strengthening aid”
00:09:28 comes from a Greek word, which is rendered “medicine,”
00:09:32 something that provides comfort, relief.
00:09:36 Those five brothers, those friends,
00:09:39 could not relieve Paul from his prison cell,
00:09:42 but they could be comforting and “a strengthening aid”
00:09:46 so that he could endure what he was going through.
00:09:49 They were willing to do whatever they needed to do to bring him comfort
00:09:53 —to be his messenger, to provide material things for him,
00:09:57 like clothing and writing materials.
00:10:00 That’s a true friend.
00:10:03 From his experience, he said at 1 Thessalonians 5:14:
00:10:08 “Speak consolingly to those who are depressed [or discouraged],
00:10:12 support the weak, be patient toward all.”
00:10:16 That expression “support the weak”
00:10:20 has been rendered “to hold fast, to cleave, to the weak.”
00:10:25 Many of our brothers and sisters today —many of us—
00:10:28 are drowning in distress.
00:10:31 We’re overwhelmed with problems.
00:10:34 May we be observant; may we be willing to “dive in”
00:10:37 to rescue our brother and our sister
00:10:39 —offering them a helping hand— and hang on to them tight.
00:10:43 And may it be in our case that when we help somebody, they say of us,
00:10:48 “A true friend you are,
00:10:50 someone who showed love in times of distress.”
