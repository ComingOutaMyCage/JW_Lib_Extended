00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most likely when we speak
to our brothers and our sisters,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
our friends, our family,

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:07.528 line:10% position:50% align:center
it seems like everyone

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:09.530 line:10% position:50% align:center
is going through something stressful,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.991 line:10% position:50% align:center
something that’s causing them anxiety.

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.368 line:10% position:50% align:center
If it’s not us, it could be our mate.

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:15.911 line:10% position:50% align:center
It could be a close friend.

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.079 line:10% position:50% align:center
It could be our parents.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.206 line:10% position:50% align:center
It could be anyone that we’re close to.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
This causes worry.

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
It causes anxiety.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get stressed out over the stress.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do?

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be like David.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did David do?

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles to Psalm 18:6.

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
David did not rely on himself.

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
He turned to his best Friend
and his Rescuer, Jehovah.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 18:6 reads:

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In my distress I called on Jehovah,

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to my God I kept crying for help.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From his temple he heard my voice,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my cry to him for help reached his ears.”

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 16 goes on to say in response:

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah] reached down from on high;

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:08.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he took hold of me
and pulled me from deep waters.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He rescued me from my strong enemy,

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
from those hating me,
who were stronger than I was.”

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s comforting to read
what David went through

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah helped him.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s comforting that Jehovah promises
to do the same for you, for me,

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for all of his loyal servants.

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the past, Jehovah used angels

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he dispatched them, he sent them—

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help loyal ones like Jacob,

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon, Daniel, Mary, and Jesus.

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we still have angels helping us today.

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who does Jehovah use primarily
to help his servants on earth?

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:50.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
You, me, and our brotherhood.

00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a privilege it is
to be used by Jehovah,

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be dispatched by Jehovah,
to be an aid to someone else!

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to ask ourselves:

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Am I someone who is ready to be used?

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Am I willing to be used by Jehovah?

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:08.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Am I willing to be dispatched

00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
when someone
is going through difficult times?’

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Picture, if you will,
a young man swimming in the ocean.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s doing fine until he comes into distress.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
He begins yelling out to be rescued.

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, an alert lifeguard is there.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
He dives into the ocean;

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
he plunges in
and brings this person to safety.

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, lifeguards are there for a reason.

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:38.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re there to warn people of danger.

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if they’re in danger,
they pull them to safety.

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
We expect that a lifeguard would do that.

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah expect of us?

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he trains us to protect others

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be a lifesaver, a lifeguard,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
for other brothers and sisters
who are desperately needing help.

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a similar way,
we need to think about others.

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to be observant like a lifeguard

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see if they might be drowning in sorrow

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in some sort of distress

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see what we can do
to come to their rescue.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can we do?

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:19.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow today’s text at Proverbs 17:17.

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it in its entirety.

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “A true friend

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“shows love at all times

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:32.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is a brother
who is born for times of distress.”

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does that mean?

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A true friend shows love at all times.”

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:43.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
A true friend is not one
who makes your problems disappear.

00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
A true friend is the one who won’t disappear

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:48.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you’re facing problems.

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:50.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a true friend.

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David was going through
very difficult times, many abandoned him

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but not Jonathan, not Hushai.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were there.
They were loyal.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were true friends
through thick and thin.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were there to assist David,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue him
when he needed rescuing the most.

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:12.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they stood by David

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he needed to lean on them.

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love was the very foundation
of their friendship.

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:20.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love was enduring.

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:22.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love was strong.

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about lifeguards,
going back to our illustration.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:28.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lifeguards are not born lifeguards.

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are trained to do so

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be observant,
to come to the rescue of others.

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:36.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is training us now.

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:41.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to use that training to help others.

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to be observant.

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to be on the lookout
to come to their rescue.

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:50.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you think about true friends,
they know us very well.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:54.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we don’t say anything to them,
they are observant.

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:57.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know if we’re going through
a difficult time just by a look

00:04:57.484 --> 00:05:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe our tone of voice
or possibly our demeanor.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
They come to our rescue.

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:08.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said at John 15:13

00:05:08.537 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “no one has greater love than this,
[and what is this?]

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that someone should surrender his life

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of his friends.”

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:22.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know that our friends
are willing to sacrifice for us,

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:26.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at some point, sometimes it could mean

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would die for our friends.

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:31.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
But likely what it means
is that we are surrendering,

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:35.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving up, sacrificing
our time and our energy

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to the aid of others,

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:39.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build them up spiritually,

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:44.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
help them physically
and sometimes even emotionally.

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:48.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because love
is the very foundation, it’s enduring.

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:51.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
It never, ever fails.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:54.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes we want
to come to the aid of others,

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:56.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we don’t know what to say.

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:58.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not know what to do.

00:05:58.295 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t fix their problem.

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t take it away.

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:05.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can come to their aid
and be with them,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
be there for them, be at their side.

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:09.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes just being a good listener

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:12.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s true love.

00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:15.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
The smallest act of kindness

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:20.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
is worth far more
than the grandest intention.

00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:22.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we need to remember that.

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:25.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jehovah expects us

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be genuine and self-sacrificing

00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:34.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our love at all times for others.

00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:39.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unexpected events
happen at unexpected times.

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:41.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we need to ask ourselves,

00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:44.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Am I ready to give of myself
and put things aside

00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:48.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and jump into action
to help my brother or sister?’

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:54.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly,
the second part of verse 17 says

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:59.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a brother who is born
for times of distress.”

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:02.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are we to understand
that part of the scripture?

00:07:02.234 --> 00:07:04.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it could mean a brother or sister

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:06.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is our fleshly brother or sister,

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:09.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
but many times, it’s not.

00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:13.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be a brother or sister
spiritually who has come to our aid

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:17.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone who is a true friend,
someone who is loyal.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Proverbs 18:24 says,

00:07:19.543 --> 00:07:23.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘a true friend
is sticking closer than a brother.’

00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:27.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the opportunity
to be used by Jehovah

00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:30.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be an answer to someone’s prayer

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:35.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we allow ourselves to be used by Jehovah
to make ourselves available

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:38.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “dive in”
to come to the rescue of others.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And quite likely
we’re going to go through a distressful time,

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:47.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll need someone
to be an answer to our prayer.

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:52.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
A true friend is one who walks into your life

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
when others are walking out.

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:57.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
They enter; they come into our life
when we need them most,

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:59.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the case of David.

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:04.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might be good
at coming to the rescue right away

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:05.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
when something happens in someone’s life.

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:09.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would happen
if that illness or that issue

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
is prolonged and it goes on and on?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we still stick
to our brother and our sister

00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be there for them
in their time of distress?

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to continue
to keep in contact with them

00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assure them of Jehovah’s love
and our love by a note,

00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:31.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
an email, a text, or by visiting them.

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:34.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these will assure them
that they are truly loved.

00:08:35.452 --> 00:08:38.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think about Paul, the apostle Paul,

00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:41.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
he went through many distressful times.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when he was in Rome
in the year 60 C.E., he was imprisoned.

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:50.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
He mentioned by name
in the book of Colossians, in chapter 4,

00:08:50.258 --> 00:08:53.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
five brothers
—five friends—

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:55.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that came to his rescue.

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:59.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were brothers born
for when he was going through distress.

00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they entered into his life
when he needed them most.

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:08.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recall they were called Tychicus,

00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:13.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus.

00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:17.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what did Paul say
in Colossians 4:11 about them?

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:21.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “They have become
a source of great comfort to me,”

00:09:21.706 --> 00:09:26.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
or as the footnote says,
“a strengthening aid.”

00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:28.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting that “a strengthening aid”

00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:32.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes from a Greek word,
which is rendered “medicine,”

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:35.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that provides comfort, relief.

00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:39.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those five brothers, those friends,

00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:42.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not relieve Paul from his prison cell,

00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:46.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they could be comforting
and “a strengthening aid”

00:09:46.398 --> 00:09:49.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could endure
what he was going through.

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were willing to do whatever
they needed to do to bring him comfort

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:57.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be his messenger,
to provide material things for him,

00:09:57.492 --> 00:10:00.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
like clothing and writing materials.

00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:03.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a true friend.

00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:08.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
From his experience,
he said at 1 Thessalonians 5:14:

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:12.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Speak consolingly to those
who are depressed [or discouraged],

00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:16.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
support the weak, be patient toward all.”

00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:20.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
That expression “support the weak”

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:24.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been rendered
“to hold fast, to cleave, to the weak.”

00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:28.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our brothers and sisters today
—many of us—

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:31.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
are drowning in distress.

00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:34.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re overwhelmed with problems.

00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:37.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we be observant;
may we be willing to “dive in”

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue our brother and our sister

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:43.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
—offering them a helping hand—
and hang on to them tight.

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:48.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may it be in our case
that when we help somebody, they say of us,

00:10:48.293 --> 00:10:50.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A true friend you are,

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:54.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who showed love
in times of distress.”
