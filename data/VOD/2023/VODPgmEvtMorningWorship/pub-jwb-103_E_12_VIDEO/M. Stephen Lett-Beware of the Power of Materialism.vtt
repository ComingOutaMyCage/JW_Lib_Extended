00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.441 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, if we think about Jesus’ words

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:07.153 line:10% position:50% align:center
in today’s text,

00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:10.490 line:10% position:50% align:center
“give us today our bread for this day,”

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.534 line:10% position:50% align:center
there’s really indirect counsel

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:14.661 line:10% position:50% align:center
against materialism.

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:16.747 line:10% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus didn’t say to pray

00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:19.249 line:10% position:50% align:center
for our daily meat

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
or some other luxury food item.

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t even say that we should pray
for a month’s supply of bread

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to ‘pray for and be content
with our bread for the day.’

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, as we know,
a sizable number of Jehovah’s people today

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
are being distracted by materialism.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So since this is not an imagined

00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:46.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a real danger to Jehovah’s people,

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:49.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s discuss the theme

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:53.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beware of the Power of Materialism.”

00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:59.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall the story
of a sister and her two sons

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:04.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were exiled to Siberia.

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:06.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they were very poor.

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:09.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
they were so poor that at times

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had to literally eat
the bark off trees to survive.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:17.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they were happy
because they were all in the truth.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
But years passed,
and the three of them had an opportunity

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
to immigrate to the United States.

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:29.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two sons got excellent jobs
—high paying jobs as machinists—

00:01:29.283 --> 00:01:31.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in their material prosperity,

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:35.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
both sons fell out of the truth.

00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:38.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister tearfully remarked,

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:40.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I would rather be back in Siberia

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“eating the bark off trees to survive

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:47.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with my two sons still in the truth.”

00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:51.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, numerous other experiences
could be related

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
that illustrate the power of materialism.

00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:57.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it may well be

00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:59.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan’s most effective trap

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:03.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Jehovah’s people in these last days

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:05.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
is materialism.

00:02:05.238 --> 00:02:08.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, you might be thinking,
‘Well, isn’t sexual immorality

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
by far the number one cause
for disfellowshipping?’

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:18.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true, but we don’t have figures
for ones who fall away to materialism.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:20.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not disfellowshipped.

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:25.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
And furthermore,
how many who succumb to sexual immorality

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
were first weakened spiritually

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:30.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
by materialism?

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at least we can say that materialism

00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:38.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
is one of Satan’s most effective tools,
or traps,

00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:41.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Jehovah’s people today.

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:45.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s no wonder
that humans in Satan’s world

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
are bombarded
with so many advertising messages

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to make us want things,
even if we don’t need these things.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was an <i>Awake!</i>  magazine a while back

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
that discussed how Americans

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be bombarded

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
with up to 1,600 advertising messages
every day.

00:03:07.262 --> 00:03:09.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine that!

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And none of us can feel we’re immune

00:03:12.602 --> 00:03:16.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this pressure
—that it can’t happen to us.

00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:17.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could happen to any of us.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could slowly, gradually,

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:22.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
begin to desire material things

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:25.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even things we don’t really need.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, that makes me think of the story

00:03:28.702 --> 00:03:31.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
a circuit overseer told many years ago.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:33.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a young teenager.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was over 50 years ago.

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and his wife lived in a little trailer

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:41.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would park by the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:46.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said in one of his talks
how he bought a drill

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do work on his trailer.

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then shortly after he bought this drill,

00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:52.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
they came out with a reversible drill.

00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:54.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he thought:
‘Well, you know,

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that would be nice
to have a reversible drill.

00:03:56.232 --> 00:04:00.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be much easier
to extract the drill bit out of the hole.’

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:02.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he bought a reversible drill.

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:06.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after that,
they came out with a reversible drill

00:04:06.743 --> 00:04:09.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had a little light on it.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’d pull the trigger,
and a little light would come on.

00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:13.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he thought:
‘You know, that would be really nice.

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
My drill doesn’t have a little light on it.’

00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:18.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was about ready to buy this latest model,

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he said:
“Wait a minute!

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:22.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What am I doing?

00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:27.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often am I going to be drilling
at night?”

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he told that
to illustrate how materialism

00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:37.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
can get a hold of any of us.

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:41.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was being manipulated by Satan’s system.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Bible principles

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:50.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us avoid this deadly trap,
materialism?

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss two.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are many others,
but these two can really help us.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Micah chapter 7,

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:01.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s get this first Bible principle
that really can help us.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micah 7:7:

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But as for me,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:14.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now notice] I will show a waiting attitude

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:17.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the God of my salvation.

00:05:17.277 --> 00:05:20.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
My God will hear me.”

00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:23.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or the footnote says:
“I will wait patiently.”

00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, are we willing
to wait patiently on Jehovah?

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:29.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
This certainly applies to material things.

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, in effect, is telling us today:

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m giving you

00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:38.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘a spiritual paradise right now.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Be content with that.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t try to get your physical paradise now.

00:05:45.098 --> 00:05:47.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you that later.’

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question is,
Are we willing to wait on Jehovah, see?

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or do we, in effect,
run ahead of him and try to acquire

00:05:55.484 --> 00:05:59.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
physical paradisaic conditions
for ourselves right now

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:02.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the expense of spiritual activity?

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 3:1 says:

00:06:08.957 --> 00:06:12.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is an appointed time for everything.”

00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:14.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah has appointed our time

00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:17.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
—especially these last days
of “the last days”

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
shortly before the last day
of this old system—

00:06:21.137 --> 00:06:25.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as the time to seek and spend time

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:28.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
acquiring physical comforts

00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:32.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather,
as a time to beautify this spiritual paradise

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help others join us in this paradise.

00:06:36.236 --> 00:06:41.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder at 1 Peter 1:1 and 2:11

00:06:41.992 --> 00:06:46.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people are described
as “temporary residents!”

00:06:46.831 --> 00:06:49.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a real protection
if we think of ourselves that way:

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
temporary residents.

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the illustration has been used
of staying in a hotel room.

00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:58.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know when you’re in a hotel room,
you’re a temporary resident.

00:06:58.927 --> 00:07:03.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might do a few things
to make your stay more comfortable.

00:07:03.098 --> 00:07:07.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might rearrange the chairs;
you might reposition the lamps;

00:07:07.645 --> 00:07:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might buy some flowers
and put them on the table;

00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:14.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might spray some air freshener.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you would never rip off the wallpaper

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
and install new wallpaper.

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:26.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’d never rip up the carpet
and install new carpet or tile.

00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:28.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
You wouldn’t buy new furniture.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’d keep it simple

00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:32.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you know
you’re going to be checking out.

00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:36.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, even if you ended up
staying a few months in that hotel room,

00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:40.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if you didn’t know exactly when
you’re going to have to check out,

00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:42.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
you would still keep it simple.

00:07:42.432 --> 00:07:45.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that describes our situation.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to “check out”
of this old system.

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to “check in”
to the new world.

00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:53.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know exactly when,
but we know it’s soon.

00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:55.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we keep it simple.

00:07:55.613 --> 00:07:57.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re “temporary residents.”

00:07:57.657 --> 00:08:00.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s get a second Bible principle

00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:03.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us avoid materialism.

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:06.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Luke chapter 10.

00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus’ words here

00:08:09.002 --> 00:08:13.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us identify
this second Bible principle.

00:08:14.258 --> 00:08:17.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 10:42, the <i>B</i>  part,
Jesus said:

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For her part,

00:08:20.014 --> 00:08:23.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mary chose the good portion,

00:08:23.977 --> 00:08:26.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will not be taken away from her.”

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice she chose the good portion.

00:08:29.024 --> 00:08:32.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote says the “best portion.”

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know the story.

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:37.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha chose physical activity.

00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:40.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
She chose working in the kitchen.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:45.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary chose spiritual activity
—listening to Jesus.

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:47.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus correctly identified
who made the best choice,

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
who chose the best portion.

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:51.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, similarly with us,

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:55.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we choose
‘storing up treasure in heaven’

00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:58.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
over ‘storing up treasure on the earth,’

00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are choosing the best portion.

00:09:01.183 --> 00:09:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
it brings Jehovah’s blessing,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that results in happiness.

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:12.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all know what Proverbs 10:22 says:

00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:15.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that makes one rich,

00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:20.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
and He adds no pain with it.”

00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:25.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
1 Timothy 6:9, 10

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:27.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaks about how those who go out

00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:30.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
for money or material things

00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:33.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
can end up ‘stabbing themselves

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:37.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
all over with many pains.’

00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:39.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, isn’t that a contrast

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:42.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
—blessing from Jehovah with no pain

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:45.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stabbing yourself all over
with many pains?

00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:50.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re choosing the best portion
when we go for spiritual, heavenly, treasure.

00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:53.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another reason is heavenly treasure

00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
will result in preservation
into the new world,

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:59.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
if necessary by means of the resurrection.

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:01.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 11:4:

00:10:01.373 --> 00:10:05.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wealth will be of no benefit
on the day of fury,

00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:10.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
but righteousness
is what will rescue from death.”

00:10:10.758 --> 00:10:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
So remembering those two Bible principles
can really help us.

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that we are to wait on Jehovah.

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he says,

00:10:22.478 --> 00:10:25.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s a spiritual paradise now 
and a physical paradise later.’

00:10:25.023 --> 00:10:28.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wait on him, and when we do that
(that second principle),

00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re choosing “the best portion.”

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:33.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to be happy.
We’re going to get Jehovah’s blessings.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do this, then, like Moses,

00:10:36.744 --> 00:10:38.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll choose treasures

00:10:38.746 --> 00:10:42.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“greater than the treasures of Egypt.”

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:45.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be able to do what Jesus said

00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:49.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to pray for and to be content
with our daily bread.
