00:00:01 Now, if we think about Jesus’ words
00:00:03 in today’s text,
00:00:07 “give us today our bread for this day,”
00:00:10 there’s really indirect counsel
00:00:12 against materialism.
00:00:14 See, Jesus didn’t say to pray
00:00:16 for our daily meat
00:00:19 or some other luxury food item.
00:00:22 He didn’t even say that we should pray for a month’s supply of bread
00:00:27 but to ‘pray for and be content with our bread for the day.’
00:00:32 But, as we know, a sizable number of Jehovah’s people today
00:00:37 are being distracted by materialism.
00:00:40 So since this is not an imagined
00:00:43 but a real danger to Jehovah’s people,
00:00:46 let’s discuss the theme
00:00:49 “Beware of the Power of Materialism.”
00:00:54 I recall the story of a sister and her two sons
00:00:59 who were exiled to Siberia.
00:01:04 Now, they were very poor.
00:01:06 In fact, they were so poor that at times
00:01:09 they had to literally eat the bark off trees to survive.
00:01:14 But they were happy because they were all in the truth.
00:01:17 But years passed, and the three of them had an opportunity
00:01:21 to immigrate to the United States.
00:01:24 The two sons got excellent jobs —high paying jobs as machinists—
00:01:29 but in their material prosperity,
00:01:31 both sons fell out of the truth.
00:01:35 The sister tearfully remarked,
00:01:38 “I would rather be back in Siberia
00:01:40 “eating the bark off trees to survive
00:01:43 but with my two sons still in the truth.”
00:01:48 Well, numerous other experiences could be related
00:01:51 that illustrate the power of materialism.
00:01:55 In fact, it may well be
00:01:57 that Satan’s most effective trap
00:01:59 against Jehovah’s people in these last days
00:02:03 is materialism.
00:02:05 But now, you might be thinking, ‘Well, isn’t sexual immorality
00:02:08 by far the number one cause for disfellowshipping?’
00:02:13 That’s true, but we don’t have figures for ones who fall away to materialism.
00:02:18 They’re not disfellowshipped.
00:02:20 And furthermore, how many who succumb to sexual immorality
00:02:25 were first weakened spiritually
00:02:28 by materialism?
00:02:30 Well, at least we can say that materialism
00:02:33 is one of Satan’s most effective tools, or traps,
00:02:38 against Jehovah’s people today.
00:02:41 And it’s no wonder that humans in Satan’s world
00:02:45 are bombarded with so many advertising messages
00:02:50 designed to make us want things, even if we don’t need these things.
00:02:54 There was an Awake!  magazine a while back
00:02:56 that discussed how Americans
00:03:00 may be bombarded
00:03:02 with up to 1,600 advertising messages every day.
00:03:07 Imagine that!
00:03:09 And none of us can feel we’re immune
00:03:12 to this pressure —that it can’t happen to us.
00:03:16 It could happen to any of us.
00:03:17 We could slowly, gradually,
00:03:19 begin to desire material things
00:03:22 —even things we don’t really need.
00:03:25 In fact, that makes me think of the story
00:03:28 a circuit overseer told many years ago.
00:03:31 I was a young teenager.
00:03:33 That was over 50 years ago.
00:03:36 He and his wife lived in a little trailer
00:03:39 they would park by the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:41 And he said in one of his talks how he bought a drill
00:03:46 to do work on his trailer.
00:03:48 But then shortly after he bought this drill,
00:03:50 they came out with a reversible drill.
00:03:52 And he thought: ‘Well, you know,
00:03:54 ‘that would be nice to have a reversible drill.
00:03:56 It would be much easier to extract the drill bit out of the hole.’
00:04:00 So he bought a reversible drill.
00:04:02 Shortly after that, they came out with a reversible drill
00:04:06 that had a little light on it.
00:04:09 You’d pull the trigger, and a little light would come on.
00:04:11 And he thought: ‘You know, that would be really nice.
00:04:13 My drill doesn’t have a little light on it.’
00:04:15 He was about ready to buy this latest model,
00:04:18 and then he said: “Wait a minute!
00:04:20 “What am I doing?
00:04:22 How often am I going to be drilling at night?”
00:04:30 But he told that to illustrate how materialism
00:04:34 can get a hold of any of us.
00:04:37 He was being manipulated by Satan’s system.
00:04:41 But now, here’s a question:
00:04:43 What Bible principles
00:04:45 can help us avoid this deadly trap, materialism?
00:04:50 Let’s discuss two.
00:04:52 Now, there are many others, but these two can really help us.
00:04:55 Let’s go to Micah chapter 7,
00:04:57 and let’s get this first Bible principle that really can help us.
00:05:01 Micah 7:7:
00:05:04 “But as for me,
00:05:06 “I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.
00:05:09 “[now notice] I will show a waiting attitude
00:05:14 “for the God of my salvation.
00:05:17 My God will hear me.”
00:05:20 Or the footnote says: “I will wait patiently.”
00:05:23 See, are we willing to wait patiently on Jehovah?
00:05:27 This certainly applies to material things.
00:05:29 Jehovah, in effect, is telling us today:
00:05:33 ‘I’m giving you
00:05:35 ‘a spiritual paradise right now.
00:05:38 ‘Be content with that.
00:05:40 ‘Don’t try to get your physical paradise now.
00:05:45 I’ll give you that later.’
00:05:47 But the question is, Are we willing to wait on Jehovah, see?
00:05:50 Or do we, in effect, run ahead of him and try to acquire
00:05:55 physical paradisaic conditions for ourselves right now
00:05:59 at the expense of spiritual activity?
00:06:04 Ecclesiastes 3:1 says:
00:06:08 “There is an appointed time for everything.”
00:06:12 Well, Jehovah has appointed our time
00:06:14 —especially these last days of “the last days”
00:06:17 shortly before the last day of this old system—
00:06:21 not as the time to seek and spend time
00:06:25 acquiring physical comforts
00:06:28 but, rather, as a time to beautify this spiritual paradise
00:06:32 and help others join us in this paradise.
00:06:36 No wonder at 1 Peter 1:1 and 2:11
00:06:41 God’s people are described as “temporary residents!”
00:06:46 And it’s a real protection if we think of ourselves that way:
00:06:49 temporary residents.
00:06:51 Now, the illustration has been used of staying in a hotel room.
00:06:55 Now, you know when you’re in a hotel room, you’re a temporary resident.
00:06:58 You might do a few things to make your stay more comfortable.
00:07:03 You might rearrange the chairs; you might reposition the lamps;
00:07:07 you might buy some flowers and put them on the table;
00:07:11 you might spray some air freshener.
00:07:15 But you would never rip off the wallpaper
00:07:19 and install new wallpaper.
00:07:22 You’d never rip up the carpet and install new carpet or tile.
00:07:26 You wouldn’t buy new furniture.
00:07:28 You’d keep it simple
00:07:29 because you know you’re going to be checking out.
00:07:32 Now, even if you ended up staying a few months in that hotel room,
00:07:36 especially if you didn’t know exactly when you’re going to have to check out,
00:07:40 you would still keep it simple.
00:07:42 Well, that describes our situation.
00:07:45 We’re going to “check out” of this old system.
00:07:48 We’re going to “check in” to the new world.
00:07:51 We don’t know exactly when, but we know it’s soon.
00:07:53 So we keep it simple.
00:07:55 We’re “temporary residents.”
00:07:57 But now, let’s get a second Bible principle
00:08:00 that can help us avoid materialism.
00:08:03 Let’s go to Luke chapter 10.
00:08:06 And Jesus’ words here
00:08:09 can help us identify this second Bible principle.
00:08:14 At Luke 10:42, the B  part, Jesus said:
00:08:17 “For her part,
00:08:20 “Mary chose the good portion,
00:08:23 and it will not be taken away from her.”
00:08:26 You notice she chose the good portion.
00:08:29 The footnote says the “best portion.”
00:08:32 Now, we know the story.
00:08:34 Martha chose physical activity.
00:08:37 She chose working in the kitchen.
00:08:40 Mary chose spiritual activity —listening to Jesus.
00:08:45 Jesus correctly identified who made the best choice,
00:08:47 who chose the best portion.
00:08:49 Well, similarly with us,
00:08:51 when we choose ‘storing up treasure in heaven’
00:08:55 over ‘storing up treasure on the earth,’
00:08:58 we are choosing the best portion.
00:09:01 How so?
00:09:02 Well, for one thing, it brings Jehovah’s blessing,
00:09:05 and that results in happiness.
00:09:08 We all know what Proverbs 10:22 says:
00:09:12 “It is the blessing of Jehovah
00:09:15 “that makes one rich,
00:09:18 and He adds no pain with it.”
00:09:20 In contrast,
1 Timothy 6:9, 10
00:09:25 speaks about how those who go out
00:09:27 for money or material things
00:09:30 can end up ‘stabbing themselves
00:09:33 all over with many pains.’
00:09:37 Now, isn’t that a contrast
00:09:39 —blessing from Jehovah with no pain
00:09:42 and stabbing yourself all over with many pains?
00:09:45 Well, we’re choosing the best portion when we go for spiritual, heavenly, treasure.
00:09:50 Now, another reason is heavenly treasure
00:09:53 will result in preservation into the new world,
00:09:56 if necessary by means of the resurrection.
00:09:59 Proverbs 11:4:
00:10:01 “Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,
00:10:05 but righteousness is what will rescue from death.”
00:10:10 So remembering those two Bible principles can really help us.
00:10:14 Remember that we are to wait on Jehovah.
00:10:20 And he says,
00:10:22 ‘It’s a spiritual paradise now  and a physical paradise later.’
00:10:25 We wait on him, and when we do that (that second principle),
00:10:28 we’re choosing “the best portion.”
00:10:30 And we’re going to be happy. We’re going to get Jehovah’s blessings.
00:10:33 And if we do this, then, like Moses,
00:10:36 we’ll choose treasures
00:10:38 “greater than the treasures of Egypt.”
00:10:42 We’ll be able to do what Jesus said
00:10:45 —to pray for and to be content with our daily bread.
