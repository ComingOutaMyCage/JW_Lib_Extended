00:00:01 Today’s Watchtower  comments
00:00:03 focus on compassion,
00:00:05 which is an aspect of the quality of love.
00:00:09 Now, you will agree
00:00:11 that we can express our love and compassion
00:00:14 in many different ways to one another,
00:00:17 small and great.
00:00:20 With that thought in mind, how would you answer this question:
00:00:24 What is the greatest expression
00:00:27 of love and compassion ever shown?
00:00:32 No doubt you will answer,
00:00:35 “Jehovah giving his Son as a ransom.”
00:00:40 And, indeed, we cannot thank Jehovah enough
00:00:43 for the ransom arrangement.
00:00:45 Now, that being the case,
00:00:47 let us use today’s Morning Worship comments
00:00:51 to highlight the connection between compassion
00:00:54 and the ransom.
00:00:57 Now, to do so, we will consider these questions:
00:01:01 How does Jehovah show his love and compassion
00:01:05 through the ransom?
00:01:07 And how does the ransom emphasize
00:01:10 why we should show love and compassion?
00:01:14 To answer,
00:01:16 let us go back to the time that Adam and Eve were without sin.
00:01:21 At that time, they had a close relationship
00:01:24 with their heavenly Father.
00:01:26 Jehovah regularly spoke to them,
00:01:28 likely by means of his Son.
00:01:32 However, Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah,
00:01:35 and sin overshadowed them.
00:01:38 How did that rebellious act
00:01:40 affect their relationship with Jehovah?
00:01:44 It was as if a wall, or barrier,
00:01:47 crashed into it and destroyed it.
00:01:51 Now, what was Jehovah’s reaction
00:01:54 to the rebellion of Adam and Eve?
00:01:56 It is described at Isaiah 59:2.
00:02:02 Now, although Isaiah wrote these words
00:02:05 many years after the time of Adam,
00:02:07 they describe Jehovah’s timeless reaction
00:02:12 to disobedience.
00:02:13 Isaiah 59:2 says:
00:02:16 “Your own errors have separated you from your God.
00:02:21 “Your sins have made him hide his face from you,
00:02:26 and he refuses to hear you.”
00:02:30 Now, the Insight  book explains that the expression “hide his face”
00:02:35 signifies that Jehovah withdrew his favor.
00:02:39 And that is exactly what Jehovah did in the case of Adam and Eve.
00:02:44 Jehovah withdrew his favor,
00:02:47 and the father-child relationship was blocked.
00:02:51 And how did that wall affect the children of Adam and Eve?
00:02:56 All descendants of Adam and Eve
00:02:58 were born on the wrong side of the wall, so to speak.
00:03:02 And since no imperfect human
00:03:04 had the ability to scale that wall,
00:03:06 all mankind was left without hope
00:03:09 —captive to sin and death.
00:03:13 Now, if Jehovah would have left that situation as it was,
00:03:18 he would have acted justly,
00:03:20 because “the wages sin pays is death.”
00:03:23 However, out of his love and compassion
00:03:27 for the offspring of Adam and Eve,
00:03:29 what did Jehovah do?
00:03:32 To answer, let us illustrate
00:03:35 how Jehovah made it possible for us
00:03:37 to be brought back into a relationship with him.
00:03:41 Let’s think
00:03:43 of the face of a clock.
00:03:46 For the sake of illustration,
00:03:48 imagine that Jehovah resides at 12 o’clock.
00:03:52 And where are we?
00:03:54 Well, since we are born as sinners,
00:03:57 we are far away from Jehovah.
00:03:59 So we can put our name at 6 o’clock.
00:04:03 Now, to see what happens next, let us read several verses
00:04:07 in 1 John chapter 4.
00:04:11 Note what the apostle John states
00:04:13 at 1 John 4:10, the first part of the verse:
00:04:19 “The love is in this respect,
00:04:22 “not that we have loved God,
00:04:25 but that he loved us.”
00:04:27 And then verse 19 says:
00:04:30 “We love, because he first loved us.”
00:04:34 Now, these verses tell us that Jehovah,
00:04:37 moved by his love and compassion for us,
00:04:41 took the needed steps to finalize the arrangement
00:04:45 to come to our rescue.
00:04:47 In order to reach us, he made a detour,
00:04:51 as it were, around that wall.
00:04:55 However, as stated at Habakkuk 1:13,
00:04:59 “[Jehovah’s] eyes are too pure to look unto what is evil.”
00:05:04 Therefore, Jehovah needed to cover our sins.
00:05:07 And as we remember, the word “atonement,” as used in the Bible,
00:05:10 means “covering of sins.”
00:05:14 So to provide that needed covering,
00:05:17 in 33 C.E.
00:05:20 Jehovah offered his Son as an atoning sacrifice.
00:05:25 Now, what moved Jehovah to make that costly sacrifice?
00:05:30 Let’s read the answer at 1 John 4:9:
00:05:34 “By this the love of God was revealed in our case,
00:05:39 “that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world
00:05:44 so that we might gain life through him.”
00:05:48 Now, notice the important point.
00:05:51 Jehovah did not only have a feeling of love for us
00:05:55 but he revealed his love for us.
00:05:58 In other words, Jehovah provided visible proof
00:06:03 of his love for us by sacrificing his Son
00:06:07 in our behalf.
00:06:10 Jehovah made an arrangement for that costly sacrifice
00:06:13 so that he was able to reach out to us,
00:06:17 even to people who lived before the time of Christ.
00:06:21 So to answer our first question,
00:06:25 Jehovah shows his love and compassion through the ransom arrangement
00:06:29 because he saves us
00:06:31 despite the fact that we are sinners.
00:06:35 As The Watchtower  beautifully stated:
00:06:38 “[The] ransom . . . was provided,
00:06:40 not because we are worthy, but because we are loved.”
00:06:46 Now our second question,
00:06:48 How does the ransom emphasize
00:06:51 why we should show love to our brothers and sisters?
00:06:56 Now, let us return to our clock illustration.
00:06:59 Up to this point, we considered how Jehovah’s compassion moved him
00:07:03 to reach out from 12 to 6 o’clock, so to speak.
00:07:07 Now we will consider how we can move,
00:07:10 as it were, from 6 toward 12 o’clock.
00:07:14 What happened at 6 o’clock?
00:07:16 Well, to benefit from the ransom,
00:07:19 we exercise faith in it.
00:07:21 We dedicated ourselves to Jehovah
00:07:24 and got baptized.
00:07:27 After that, we continued to make spiritual progress
00:07:30 and draw closer to God.
00:07:33 What did we do next?
00:07:35 What else did God require of us?
00:07:39 Now, remember,
00:07:41 Jehovah gave visible proof of his love for us
00:07:45 by providing the ransom sacrifice.
00:07:48 In turn, Jehovah requires
00:07:51 that we also give visible proof of our love for him.
00:07:56 And by means of the apostle John,
00:07:58 Jehovah describes precisely
00:08:02 what kind of visible proof he expects of us.
00:08:07 We find the apostle’s instructions
00:08:09 at 1 John 4:11.
00:08:12 Let’s read it:
00:08:14 “Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us,
00:08:19 “then we are also under obligation
00:08:22 to love [God in return].”
00:08:26 Is that what John wrote?
00:08:28 No, although that is what we may have expected.
00:08:32 Instead, John wrote:
00:08:34 “Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us,
00:08:39 “then we are also under obligation
00:08:41 to love one another.”
00:08:44 So, what is the comparison that John made?
00:08:47 This: Jehovah gave visible proof
00:08:50 of his love for us by sending his Son.
00:08:52 Now, “if this is how God loved us,” wrote John,
00:08:57 how should we respond?
00:08:59 We give visible proof of our gratitude for the ransom
00:09:03 by “[loving] one another.”
00:09:06 Now, think for a moment about this amazing statement.
00:09:11 Of all the visible acts of faith
00:09:14 that we could have been asked to demonstrate
00:09:16 in order to express our gratitude for the ransom,
00:09:20 what does Jehovah require of us?
00:09:23 John stated that we should love our brothers and sisters.
00:09:28 Clearly, in Jehovah’s eyes,
00:09:31 our showing love to one another
00:09:33 is of the utmost importance.
00:09:37 So let’s return one more time to our clock illustration.
00:09:43 Where do we want to be today?
00:09:45 By showing love for our fellow believers,
00:09:48 we show Jehovah our gratitude
00:09:51 and we continue to make spiritual progress.
00:09:55 As a result, we are drawing ever closer to Jehovah
00:10:00 and to the many blessings he has in store for us.
00:10:04 Eventually, we will again enjoy
00:10:07 the precious relationship that Adam and Eve lost.
00:10:13 In the meantime, today we are very thankful
00:10:16 to be part of a worldwide family of brothers and sisters
00:10:21 who give visible proof of their warm love for one another,
00:10:25 especially during this challenging time.
00:10:28 And why will we continue to love one another?
00:10:33 Because by doing so,
00:10:35 we show our gratitude to Jehovah for the ransom arrangement,
00:10:40 which is the greatest expression
00:10:42 of love and compassion ever shown.
