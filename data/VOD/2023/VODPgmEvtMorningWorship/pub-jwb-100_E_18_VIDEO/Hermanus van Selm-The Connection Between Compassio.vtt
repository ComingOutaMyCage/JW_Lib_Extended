Today’s <i>Watchtower </i> comments

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:05.822 line:10% position:50% align:center
focus on compassion,

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:09.559 line:10% position:50% align:center
which is an aspect of the quality of love.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.061 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, you will agree

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.130 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we can express our love and compassion

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.667 line:10% position:50% align:center
in many different ways to one another,

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
small and great.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that thought in mind,
how would you answer this question:

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the greatest expression

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
of love and compassion ever shown?

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you will answer,

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah giving his Son as a ransom.”

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, indeed,
we cannot thank Jehovah enough

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the ransom arrangement.

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:47.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that being the case,

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:51.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us use today’s Morning Worship comments

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:54.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
to highlight the connection
between compassion

00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:57.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ransom.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to do so,
we will consider these questions:

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah
show his love and compassion

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:07.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the ransom?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how does the ransom emphasize

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:13.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we should show love and compassion?

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer,

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:20.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us go back to the time
that Adam and Eve were without sin.

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:24.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, they had a close relationship

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their heavenly Father.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah regularly spoke to them,

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:32.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely by means of his Son.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah,

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sin overshadowed them.

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did that rebellious act

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
affect their relationship with Jehovah?

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:47.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was as if a wall, or barrier,

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
crashed into it and destroyed it.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what was Jehovah’s reaction

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the rebellion of Adam and Eve?

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is described at Isaiah 59:2.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:05.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, although Isaiah wrote these words

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
many years after the time of Adam,

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:12.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
they describe Jehovah’s timeless reaction

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
to disobedience.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 59:2 says:

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your own errors
have separated you from your God.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:26.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your sins have made him
hide his face from you,

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he refuses to hear you.”

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Insight </i> book explains
that the expression “hide his face”

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:39.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
signifies that Jehovah withdrew his favor.

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is exactly what Jehovah did
in the case of Adam and Eve.

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah withdrew his favor,

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the father-child relationship
was blocked.

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:56.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did that wall
affect the children of Adam and Eve?

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
All descendants of Adam and Eve

00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
were born on the wrong side of the wall,
so to speak.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:04.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since no imperfect human

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the ability to scale that wall,

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
all mankind was left without hope

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
—captive to sin and death.

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:18.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if Jehovah
would have left that situation as it was,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would have acted justly,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
because “the wages sin pays is death.”

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, out of his love and compassion

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the offspring of Adam and Eve,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did Jehovah do?

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer, let us illustrate

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah made it possible for us

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:41.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be brought back
into a relationship with him.

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:43.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s think

00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:45.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the face of a clock.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the sake of illustration,

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine that Jehovah resides at 12 o’clock.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
And where are we?

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, since we are born as sinners,

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are far away from Jehovah.

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:02.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can put our name at 6 o’clock.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to see what happens next,
let us read several verses

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:10.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1 John chapter 4.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the apostle John states

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:18.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 John 4:10, the first part of the verse:

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The love is in this respect,

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:25.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not that we have loved God,

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that he loved us.”

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then verse 19 says:

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:34.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We love, because he first loved us.”

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these verses tell us that Jehovah,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved by his love and compassion for us,

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:45.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
took the needed steps
to finalize the arrangement

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to our rescue.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to reach us, he made a detour,

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it were, around that wall.

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as stated at Habakkuk 1:13,

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:04.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah’s] eyes are too pure
to look unto what is evil.”

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, Jehovah needed to cover our sins.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we remember,
the word “atonement,” as used in the Bible,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “covering of sins.”

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:17.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to provide that needed covering,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 33 C.E.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah offered his Son
as an atoning sacrifice.

00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:30.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what moved Jehovah
to make that costly sacrifice?

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:34.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the answer at 1 John 4:9:

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:39.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By this the love of God
was revealed in our case,

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:44.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that God sent his only-begotten Son
into the world

00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:48.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we might gain life through him.”

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice the important point.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not only have
a feeling of love for us

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:58.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he revealed his love for us.

00:05:58.574 --> 00:06:03.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
Jehovah provided visible proof

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his love for us
by sacrificing his Son

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our behalf.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:13.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made an arrangement
for that costly sacrifice

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:17.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he was able to reach out to us,

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:21.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
even to people
who lived before the time of Christ.

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:25.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to answer our first question,

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah shows his love and compassion
through the ransom arrangement

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:31.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he saves us

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:35.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the fact that we are sinners.

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:38.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
As <i>The Watchtower</i>  beautifully stated:

00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:40.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[The] ransom . . . was provided,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because we are worthy,
but because we are loved.”

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now our second question,

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does the ransom emphasize

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:55.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we should show love
to our brothers and sisters?

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:59.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let us return to our clock illustration.

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:03.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up to this point, we considered
how Jehovah’s compassion moved him

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach out
from 12 to 6 o’clock, so to speak.

00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:10.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we will consider how we can move,

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it were, from 6 toward 12 o’clock.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened at 6 o’clock?

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to benefit from the ransom,

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
we exercise faith in it.

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:24.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
We dedicated ourselves to Jehovah

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got baptized.

00:07:27.497 --> 00:07:30.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, we continued
to make spiritual progress

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and draw closer to God.

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did we do next?

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:38.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else did God require of us?

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember,

00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:45.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave visible proof
of his love for us

00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:48.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
by providing the ransom sacrifice.

00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:51.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, Jehovah requires

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we also give visible proof
of our love for him.

00:07:56.492 --> 00:07:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by means of the apostle John,

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah describes precisely

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:06.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of visible proof
he expects of us.

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:09.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find the apostle’s instructions

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:12.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 John 4:11.

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it:

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us,

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:22.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then we are also under obligation

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:26.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love [God in return].”

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:28.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that what John wrote?

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:32.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, although that is
what we may have expected.

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:34.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, John wrote:

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us,

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then we are also under obligation

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love one another.”

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:47.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the comparison that John made?

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
This: Jehovah gave visible proof

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:52.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his love for us by sending his Son.

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, “if this is how God loved us,”
wrote John,

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:59.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
how should we respond?

00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:03.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
We give visible proof
of our gratitude for the ransom

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:06.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
by “[loving] one another.”

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think for a moment
about this amazing statement.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of all the visible acts of faith

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:16.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could have been asked
to demonstrate

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:20.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to express
our gratitude for the ransom,

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does Jehovah require of us?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
John stated
that we should love our brothers and sisters.

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:33.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
our showing love to one another

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:37.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
is of the utmost importance.

00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:42.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s return
one more time to our clock illustration.

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:45.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where do we want to be today?

00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
By showing love for our fellow believers,

00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show Jehovah our gratitude

00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:55.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we continue to make spiritual progress.

00:09:55.411 --> 00:10:00.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, we are drawing
ever closer to Jehovah

00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to the many blessings
he has in store for us.

00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:07.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, we will again enjoy

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
the precious relationship
that Adam and Eve lost.

00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
today we are very thankful

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:21.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be part of a worldwide family
of brothers and sisters

00:10:21.304 --> 00:10:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
who give visible proof
of their warm love for one another,

00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:28.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially during this challenging time.

00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:33.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why will we continue to love one another?

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:35.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because by doing so,

00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show our gratitude to Jehovah
for the ransom arrangement,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the greatest expression

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
of love and compassion ever shown.
