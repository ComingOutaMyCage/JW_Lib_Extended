00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:05.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
The text for today here at Colossians 4:6

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:10.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
sets a standard for us in our speech.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.297 line:10% position:50% align:center
It says: “Let your words always be gracious,

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.633 line:10% position:50% align:center
seasoned with salt.”

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we will consider three questions.

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:21.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one:

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:24.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is gracious speech?

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:26.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second:

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are gracious words so important?

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third:

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:38.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we learn to speak graciously?

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for that first one
(what is gracious speech?),

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:46.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “gracious” has a special meaning.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul used this Greek word

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:54.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 100 times in his writings.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is so special about this word?

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
This word is also translated

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:04.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “undeserved kindness,”

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:09.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in some cases
it is translated as “a kind gift.”

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
So apply it to the words in this text:

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:16.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Let your words always be a kind gift.’

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can compare this concept

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:23.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the words of Paul
in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says at Ephesians 4:29,

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
the second part of the verse,

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“only what is good

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for building up as the need may be,

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
to impart what is beneficial to the hearers.”

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:46.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now note what he says
in the first part of this verse:

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let a rotten word

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:52.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
not come out of your mouth.”

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a strong concept.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:59.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you have had in your refrigerator

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
some food that went off.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the outside it looks fine.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when you open that lid
and that putrid smell comes out,

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:10.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
you turn your head away,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
you close the lid,
and you get rid of it as fast as you can.

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think of a conversation
you have with your close friend.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re expecting to hear something
really good and upbuilding from him,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
but out come these critical, nasty,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and negative comments about somebody else

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
or about some arrangement.

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:39.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
How disappointing!

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
The smell is just overwhelming,

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:46.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you cannot react
as you would with that container of food

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
in case you become the next target.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you do?

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just quietly put a lid
on that conversation and throw it away.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’m sure all of us

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:04.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been there at some time
on either side of the conversation.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we come to the second part.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it so important
to have gracious speech?

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:18.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the words here in James
—James chapter 3.

00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:21.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here it says in verse 6,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 3:6:

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:26.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tongue is also a fire.

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:30.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tongue represents
a world of unrighteousness

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“among our body members,
for it defiles all the body

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and sets the whole course of life on fire,

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:43.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is set on fire by Gehenna.”

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:47.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
So who is ‘liable to Gehenna’?

00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:49.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the one misusing their tongue.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:52.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said the same thing.

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider his words here in Matthew

00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:58.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew chapter 12.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:03.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here Jesus says in verse 36

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he says:

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:11.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I tell you that men will render an account

00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:13.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on Judgment Day

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:18.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
for every unprofitable saying
that they speak.”

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may ask, ‘But is Jehovah not judging us

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the person we are on the inside?’

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:30.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look what it says in verse 34,
the second part of verse 34:

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:34.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For out of the abundance of the heart

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mouth speaks.”

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
So words seem to appear
from the top of the head,

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they really come from the heart.

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah judges a person on the inside

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on the impact their words

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
might have on other people.

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:59.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah sets
the most beautiful example for us

00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:02.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
of kind and gracious speech.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:06.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at this example in Zechariah

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Zechariah chapter 1.

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:12.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here in Zechariah chapter 1,

00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
an angel of Jehovah is speaking to Jehovah

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 12.

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:21.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this angel is very distressed

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it seems that false worship

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
is gaining the upper hand

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and true worship is being pushed aside.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he says here in verse 12:

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:34.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah of armies,

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“how long will you withhold
your mercy from Jerusalem

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:40.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the cities of Judah,

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:43.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom you have been
indignant these 70 years?”

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, look at verse 13:

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:51.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah answered the angel
who was speaking with me,

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
with kind and comforting words.”

00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:58.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the account does not say
what Jehovah said,

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we know Jehovah is gracious and kind.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:07.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we come to our third question:

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we learn

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:15.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be gracious and to have gracious speech?

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are two principles
we’ve got to highlight,

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this is a very complicated subject.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the first one we would like to highlight

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
is at Ephesians 5:1

00:06:26.602 --> 00:06:28.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ephesians 5:1.

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there it says:

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:37.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, become imitators of God,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
as beloved children.”

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know children imitate their parents.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just find it so enjoyable

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something for their parents.

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:49.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
They imitate them.

00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
See this little girl?

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
She gives a gift to her mother.

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it is not the best gift

00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the greatest gift ever,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to the mother it is wonderful.

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:06.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because she’s imitating her.

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
She probably saw her being
generous to other people;

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:12.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
she imitates that.

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that makes her feel very, very good.

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same with Jehovah.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we imitate him,

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:24.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
we bring joy to his heart.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s all a matter
of appreciation, isn’t it?

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing builds appreciation

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than being grateful,

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:38.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say thank you.

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thank Jehovah

00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:44.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
for everything he does for us every day.

00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we probably don’t even know
the half of what he really is doing for us.

00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:53.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we thank him all the time

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:58.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every day make it a point to thank him
for the things we see he does for us—

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:00.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will engender in our hearts

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
an appreciation for Jehovah

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will admire him.

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:10.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the more we admire Jehovah,

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:13.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we will be inclined to imitate him.

00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:18.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is no need
to feel unworthy, saying,

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, well, I cannot imitate Jehovah.”

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:25.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only qualification needed

00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:29.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to have an appreciative heart.

00:08:31.327 --> 00:08:34.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second principle
we would like to highlight

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:36.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
is contained in our text for today,

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:41.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says our words
should be “seasoned with salt.”

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:45.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in Bible times
they didn’t have refrigeration.

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in order to preserve food,
they would salt it.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:54.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would season it with salt

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that the food was not spoiled.

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:03.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our words
—our gracious words—

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:08.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
should preserve the dignity of other people;

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
they should preserve love and friendships

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:16.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will last forever.

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
These words that we speak

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:24.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come from an appreciative heart.

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:28.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
So look for the good in other people

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say the right thing

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:34.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen the good in them.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:38.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do say the nicest things
to those we love, don’t we?

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:41.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in conclusion,

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:45.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of what we go through
or how we feel,

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:47.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
always be gracious.

00:09:47.903 --> 00:09:52.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is never wrong to do good and be kind.

00:09:52.742 --> 00:09:54.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give up.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And make this the standard,
as it says at Psalm 19:14:

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:02.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let the sayings of my mouth

00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:05.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the meditation of my heart

00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“become pleasurable before you,

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer.”
