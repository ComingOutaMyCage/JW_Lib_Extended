00:00:01 When we think about it,
00:00:02 eight and a half million Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:06 like you and me,
00:00:07 are in the process of fulfilling
00:00:09 our text for today.
00:00:11 And that is taken from Psalm 133:1.
00:00:14 It says:
00:00:15 “Look! How good and how pleasant it is
00:00:19 for brothers to dwell together in unity!”
00:00:21 So we are so privileged and proud to be part of this organization.
00:00:26 Jehovah has drawn each one of us
00:00:28 to be part of this unified organization.
00:00:31 Now, in contrast, what do we see in the world?
00:00:35 Their governments and their religions are all divided.
00:00:39 It’s disunited.
00:00:41 So maybe rephrasing the scripture,
00:00:44 this is what they’re experiencing now:
00:00:46 ‘Look! How bad and how unpleasant it is
00:00:49 to dwell together in disunity!’
00:00:53 It’s a sad reality,
00:00:55 but our hope that we share with them
00:00:57 could change that very quickly.
00:01:00 So, what is it that makes Jehovah’s organization (our organization)
00:01:04 so different, so special?
00:01:07 Two things:
00:01:08 It’s the language we speak
00:01:10 as well as the clothes we wear.
00:01:13 What do we mean by that?
00:01:15 Well, let’s go to Zephaniah 3:9
00:01:18 to see the language  that we have and are unified with.
00:01:23 At Zephaniah 3:9, it reads:
00:01:27 “[And] I will change the language of the peoples
00:01:29 “to a pure language [and we know that is a Scriptural truth],
00:01:34 “so that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah,
00:01:37 to serve him shoulder to shoulder”
00:01:40 —or, as the footnote says, “worship him in unity.”
00:01:44 So the privilege for us to work shoulder to shoulder
00:01:47 with all those on earth is amazing!
00:01:50 And we see how we’re growing and how much more united we are becoming.
00:01:55 But, really, if we’re just looking at the earthly part,
00:01:58 we’re short-sighted.
00:01:59 We need to look at the heavenly part as well
00:02:02 and how we’re united with Jehovah’s heavenly organization
00:02:07 shoulder to shoulder.
00:02:09 In fact, just to illustrate this,
00:02:11 we know that Jehovah’s hand of applied power
00:02:14 is steering his heavenly organization, right?
00:02:16 So we have this magnet here that could be the celestial chariot.
00:02:20 Jehovah’s spirit directly has that chariot move
00:02:24 based on what he wants and what he directs with his holy spirit.
00:02:28 And connected to that is
00:02:31 the earthly part of his organization.
00:02:34 And as Jehovah moves the heavenly part,
00:02:36 the earthly part is directly connected with it.
00:02:40 Well, where do we fit in?
00:02:42 Well, we can be likened to these
00:02:47 paper clips.
00:02:49 So as Jehovah moves his organization,
00:02:51 what happens from heaven down to the earth?
00:02:54 We are following right along with it.
00:02:56 But sometimes —isn’t it true?—
00:02:58 as Jehovah moves his organization,
00:03:00 there’s a little bit of a whiplash happening with all of us.
00:03:03 So we appreciate when Ezekiel
00:03:06 in his vision heard, “Wheelwork!”
00:03:10 That’s when the wheels went to work,
00:03:12 and that’s when Jehovah’s heavenly organization was on the move.
00:03:16 But we appreciate that we need to be on the move as well.
00:03:20 And by means of “the faithful and discreet slave,”
00:03:23 we are getting from Jehovah everything we need
00:03:26 to be unified, to be strong,
00:03:29 to worship Jehovah in pure worship
00:03:32 in harmony with his heavenly organization.
00:03:36 So we feed on the same spiritual food,
00:03:39 we hold to the same Scriptural standards of conduct,
00:03:42 and we share in the same vital work of preaching
00:03:46 and disciple-making work.
00:03:48 All of this unites Jehovah’s people
00:03:51 shoulder to shoulder.
00:03:53 Now, through Jehovah’s organization,
00:03:55 we have been fed so well by the Governing Body
00:03:58 through our Watchtower,  through conventions,
00:04:02 assemblies, midweek meetings, through JW Broadcasting®.
00:04:06 All of these have served to unite us as a people.
00:04:10 In fact, you might remember, just talking about JW Broadcasting,
00:04:14 that it was October of 2014
00:04:17 when the first broadcast aired, and that was with Brother Lett.
00:04:20 And we know that was only in one language.
00:04:24 And now what do we have?
00:04:26 With the approval of the Governing Body,
00:04:28 they have increased the languages starting first in English.
00:04:32 Now, we know that the Gilead graduation has been added
00:04:35 and the annual meeting has been added
00:04:37 to the broadcast throughout the year.
00:04:40 Well, originally, the translators around the world
00:04:43 were doing their best to keep up with all
00:04:45 the other translation that was needed,
00:04:47 and they were not able to do the Gilead graduation or the annual meeting.
00:04:52 But interestingly, the Governing Body now has put those on as monthly broadcasts.
00:04:57 What has that done for the organization?
00:05:00 It has united us.
00:05:02 In 2016, there were only 34 languages
00:05:05 able to translate the Gilead graduation.
00:05:08 Now 162 languages
00:05:12 have that deep spiritual truth.
00:05:14 And the same is true with the annual meeting.
00:05:16 Now thousands of our brothers and sisters have that same spiritual food,
00:05:21 that feeding program that we have been enjoying for many years.
00:05:25 So Jehovah’s organization is on the move.
00:05:29 It is united.
00:05:30 But the question is:
00:05:33 What about me?
00:05:35 Where do I fit in
00:05:36 to this unification of heaven and earth?
00:05:41 It really comes down to, again,
00:05:43 the language that we speak —the “pure language”—
00:05:45 as well as the clothing that we wear.
00:05:49 What do I mean by that?
00:05:50 Let’s go to Colossians chapter 3,
00:05:53 and notice verse 14.
00:05:57 Colossians 3:14 says
00:06:00 that we should “clothe [ourselves] with love.”
00:06:04 That’s the clothing.
00:06:06 And what does that help us with?
00:06:08 “For it is a perfect bond of union.”
00:06:11 Paul goes on to say in verse 12 what this clothing entails.
00:06:15 It’s “tender affections of compassion, kindness,
00:06:19 humility, mildness, and patience.”
00:06:23 What it means, if we’re wearing this,
00:06:25 is that we will continue to “[put] up with one another,
00:06:28 “[forgiving] one another freely
00:06:30 “even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.
00:06:33 “Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,
00:06:37 you must also do the same.”
00:06:39 So love is the “perfect bond of union.”
00:06:43 Unity is based on love.
00:06:45 We worship Jehovah.
00:06:47 “God is love.”
00:06:49 His Son, Jesus, perfectly represented him,
00:06:52 mirrored every aspect of Him with love.
00:06:54 And Jesus said that his disciples would be identified with love.
00:07:00 So in what ways can we be a unifying factor?
00:07:04 Well, as we just read, we need to cultivate those godly qualities
00:07:08 of compassion, kindness, humility,
00:07:11 mildness, patience, forgiveness.
00:07:14 These are the qualities that hold us together
00:07:16 and keep us together unitedly.
00:07:20 Now, when we think about that little illustration I used there,
00:07:23 working shoulder to shoulder could have its problems.
00:07:27 Sometimes we could be bent out of shape
00:07:31 when we are working shoulder to shoulder.
00:07:33 Well, what do we need to keep in mind?
00:07:36 Again, it’s those qualities
00:07:38 of forgiveness, compassion, being yielding,
00:07:42 and not looking at our organization
00:07:44 as a way to climb some sort of ladder to get more responsibility.
00:07:48 It’s everyone working in their place, working together unitedly.
00:07:54 When we think about paper clips (I did a little research on this),
00:07:58 paper clips come, of course, in different shapes, sizes, and colors.
00:08:03 But what’s the purpose of a paper clip?
00:08:05 Isn’t it to hold pieces of paper together?
00:08:09 Isn’t that the same with you and me?
00:08:11 The purpose that we have as Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:08:14 is to unite, to be a uniting factor,
00:08:17 in our family, in the congregation,
00:08:20 here at Bethel, or in any aspect of our organization.
00:08:24 And it’s interesting that the engineers of paper clips
00:08:28 actually have something that is called “yield stress,”
00:08:31 or “the amount of stress needed to permanently reshape the wire.”
00:08:36 If it has too much stress,
00:08:38 that means it’ll be hard to open and unite the paper.
00:08:41 If it has too low of a yield stress, then it becomes wimpy,
00:08:45 and it won’t hold anything together.
00:08:47 So we can see where you and I
00:08:49 need to have some rigidness in us.
00:08:52 We need to stand firm,
00:08:54 but we need to have those Christian qualities
00:08:56 to be yielding and to be peaceable.
00:08:59 And that’s what Paul was saying at 1 Corinthians 1:10,
00:09:03 if you would turn there with me.
00:09:06 Having this “perfect bond of union”
00:09:08 means having unity but not divisions and disunity.
00:09:12 First Corinthians 1:10 reads:
00:09:14 “Now I urge you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00:09:18 “that you should all speak in agreement
00:09:20 “and that there should be no divisions among you,
00:09:24 “but that you may be completely united in the same mind
00:09:27 and in the same line of thought.”
00:09:31 So, again, don’t allow a place for Satan the Devil to cause divisions,
00:09:36 to distance us from Jehovah and from his organization
00:09:40 both in heaven and on earth.
00:09:42 And we never want to be one who will be a disuniting factor
00:09:46 by not putting on that new personality, those Christian qualities.
00:09:51 And if we do get bent out of shape from time to time,
00:09:54 like our little paper clip here,
00:09:56 Paul says at 2 Corinthians 13:11
00:09:58 that we should “continue to . . . be readjusted.”
00:10:01 And we need to have that same lowliness of mind,
00:10:04 ‘considering others as superior to us’
00:10:07 by being yielding and being patient.
00:10:10 And if we do this, we are aligning ourselves
00:10:14 with Jehovah’s organization, both in heaven and on earth.
00:10:16 Well, there is our theme scripture for today.
00:10:19 We will be happy,
00:10:21 because ‘how good it is and how pleasant it is
00:10:24 to dwell together in unity!’
