00:00:01.618 --> 00:00:02.786 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we think about it,

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:06.089 line:10% position:50% align:center
eight and a half million Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.457 line:10% position:50% align:center
like you and me,

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:09.759 line:10% position:50% align:center
are in the process of fulfilling

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.261 line:10% position:50% align:center
our text for today.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.264 line:10% position:50% align:center
And that is taken from Psalm 133:1.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.265 line:10% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! How good and how pleasant it is

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:26.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we are so privileged and proud
to be part of this organization.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has drawn each one of us

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:31.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be part of this unified organization.

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in contrast,
what do we see in the world?

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their governments and their religions
are all divided.

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:41.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s disunited.

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:44.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
So maybe rephrasing the scripture,

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is what they’re experiencing now:

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Look! How bad and how unpleasant it is

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:53.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dwell together in disunity!’

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a sad reality,

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our hope that we share with them

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
could change that very quickly.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is it that makes
Jehovah’s organization (our organization)

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
so different, so special?

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two things:

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:10.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the language we speak

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the clothes we wear.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go to Zephaniah 3:9

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:23.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see the language 
that we have and are unified with.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Zephaniah 3:9, it reads:

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[And] I will change
the language of the peoples

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to a pure language
[and we know that is a Scriptural truth],

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that all of them
may call on the name of Jehovah,

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:40.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve him shoulder to shoulder”

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:44.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
—or, as the footnote says,
“worship him in unity.”

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the privilege for us
to work shoulder to shoulder

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all those on earth is amazing!

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:55.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we see how we’re growing
and how much more united we are becoming.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really,
if we’re just looking at the earthly part,

00:01:58.535 --> 00:01:59.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re short-sighted.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to look at the heavenly part as well

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we’re united
with Jehovah’s heavenly organization

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:09.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
shoulder to shoulder.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, just to illustrate this,

00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:14.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that Jehovah’s hand of applied power

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
is steering his heavenly organization, right?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have this magnet here
that could be the celestial chariot.

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:24.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s spirit
directly has that chariot move

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on what he wants
and what he directs with his holy spirit.

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:31.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And connected to that is

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
the earthly part of his organization.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jehovah moves the heavenly part,

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
the earthly part
is directly connected with it.

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, where do we fit in?

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can be likened to these

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
paper clips.

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as Jehovah moves his organization,

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:54.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happens from heaven down to the earth?

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are following right along with it.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes
—isn’t it true?—

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah moves his organization,

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a little bit of a whiplash happening
with all of us.

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciate when Ezekiel

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:10.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his vision heard, “Wheelwork!”

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when the wheels went to work,

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:16.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s when Jehovah’s
heavenly organization was on the move.

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:20.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we appreciate that we need
to be on the move as well.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by means
of “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:26.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are getting from Jehovah
everything we need

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:29.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be unified, to be strong,

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worship Jehovah in pure worship

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:36.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with his heavenly organization.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we feed on the same spiritual food,

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hold
to the same Scriptural standards of conduct,

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we share
in the same vital work of preaching

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and disciple-making work.

00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:51.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this unites Jehovah’s people

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
shoulder to shoulder.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, through Jehovah’s organization,

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:58.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have been fed so well
by the Governing Body

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
through our <i>Watchtower,</i>  through conventions,

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
assemblies, midweek meetings,
through JW Broadcasting®.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these have served
to unite us as a people.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, you might remember,
just talking about JW Broadcasting,

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:17.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was October of 2014

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:20.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the first broadcast aired,
and that was with Brother Lett.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that was only in one language.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now what do we have?

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the approval of the Governing Body,

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have increased the languages
starting first in English.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know
that the Gilead graduation has been added

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:37.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the annual meeting has been added

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the broadcast
throughout the year.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, originally,
the translators around the world

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
were doing their best to keep up with all

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other translation that was needed,

00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:52.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were not able to do
the Gilead graduation or the annual meeting.

00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
But interestingly, the Governing Body
now has put those on as monthly broadcasts.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has that done for the organization?

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has united us.

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:05.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2016,
there were only 34 languages

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:08.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
able to translate the Gilead graduation.

00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now 162 languages

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
have that deep spiritual truth.

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:16.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same is true with the annual meeting.

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:21.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now thousands of our brothers and sisters
have that same spiritual food,

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:25.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
that feeding program
that we have been enjoying for many years.

00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:29.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah’s organization is on the move.

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:30.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is united.

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question is:

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about me?

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where do I fit in

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:41.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this unification of heaven and earth?

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:43.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really comes down to, again,

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
the language that we speak
—the “pure language”—

00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:49.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the clothing that we wear.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:50.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do I mean by that?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Colossians chapter 3,

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice verse 14.

00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:00.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:14 says

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should “clothe [ourselves]
with love.”

00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the clothing.

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:08.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does that help us with?

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it is a perfect bond of union.”

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul goes on to say in verse 12
what this clothing entails.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s “tender affections
of compassion, kindness,

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility, mildness, and patience.”

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
What it means,
if we’re wearing this,

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:28.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we will continue
to “[put] up with one another,

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:30.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[forgiving] one another freely

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if anyone has a cause for complaint
against another.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:37.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must also do the same.”

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
So love is the “perfect bond of union.”

00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:45.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unity is based on love.

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
We worship Jehovah.

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:49.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is love.”

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
His Son, Jesus, perfectly represented him,

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
mirrored every aspect of Him with love.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus said that his disciples
would be identified with love.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in what ways can we be a unifying factor?

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:08.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we just read,
we need to cultivate those godly qualities

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
of compassion, kindness, humility,

00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:14.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
mildness, patience, forgiveness.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are the qualities that hold us together

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:20.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep us together unitedly.

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:23.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we think
about that little illustration I used there,

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
working shoulder to shoulder
could have its problems.

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:31.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we could be bent out of shape

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:33.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we are working shoulder to shoulder.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we need to keep in mind?

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:38.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, it’s those qualities

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
of forgiveness, compassion, being yielding,

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:44.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not looking at our organization

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:48.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a way to climb some sort of ladder
to get more responsibility.

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:53.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s everyone working in their place,
working together unitedly.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think about paper clips
(I did a little research on this),

00:07:58.594 --> 00:08:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
paper clips come, of course,
in different shapes, sizes, and colors.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the purpose of a paper clip?

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it to hold pieces of paper together?

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that the same with you and me?

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose that we have
as Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:08:14.844 --> 00:08:17.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to unite, to be a uniting factor,

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our family, in the congregation,

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:24.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
here at Bethel,
or in any aspect of our organization.

00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:28.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s interesting
that the engineers of paper clips

00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually have something
that is called “yield stress,”

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:36.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “the amount of stress needed
to permanently reshape the wire.”

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it has too much stress,

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means it’ll be hard to open
and unite the paper.

00:08:41.704 --> 00:08:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it has too low of a yield stress,
then it becomes wimpy,

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it won’t hold anything together.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can see where you and I

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to have some rigidness in us.

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to stand firm,

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we need to have those Christian qualities

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be yielding and to be peaceable.

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what Paul was saying
at 1 Corinthians 1:10,

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:06.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you would turn there with me.

00:09:06.162 --> 00:09:08.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having this “perfect bond of union”

00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:12.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
means having unity
but not divisions and disunity.

00:09:12.068 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 1:10 reads:

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I urge you, brothers,
through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:20.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you should all speak in agreement

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:24.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that there should be
no divisions among you,

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:27.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that you may be completely united
in the same mind

00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the same line of thought.”

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, again, don’t allow a place
for Satan the Devil to cause divisions,

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:40.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
to distance us
from Jehovah and from his organization

00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:42.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
both in heaven and on earth.

00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we never want to be one
who will be a disuniting factor

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:51.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not putting on that new personality,
those Christian qualities.

00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do get bent out of shape
from time to time,

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
like our little paper clip here,

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says at 2 Corinthians 13:11

00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we
should “continue to . . . be readjusted.”

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we need to have
that same lowliness of mind,

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘considering others as superior to us’

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:10.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being yielding and being patient.

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:14.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do this,
we are aligning ourselves

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:16.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s organization,
both in heaven and on earth.

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there is our theme scripture for today.

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will be happy,

00:10:21.837 --> 00:10:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
because ‘how good it is
and how pleasant it is

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dwell together in unity!’
