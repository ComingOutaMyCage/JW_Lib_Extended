00:00:01 I thought for a few minutes this morning
00:00:04 we could consider two verses that highlight
00:00:07 the importance
00:00:08 of being merciful in our actions
00:00:11 and also highlight the blessings
00:00:14 that result when we are merciful.
00:00:17 The first verse is at Matthew 5:7.
00:00:21 So I invite you to turn there,
00:00:25 Matthew 5:7.
00:00:28 And here in the Sermon on the Mount
00:00:31 in the happinesses that introduce this sermon,
00:00:35 Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful,
00:00:39 [why?] since they will be shown mercy.”
00:00:47 How is it that “the merciful” are “shown mercy”?
00:00:53 Well, a striking example can be found in Acts chapter 9,
00:00:57 where we’re introduced to a first-century disciple
00:01:01 named Tabitha, or Dorcas.
00:01:05 She lived in the port city of Joppa.
00:01:08 And what reputation did Tabitha have?
00:01:11 Well, she’s described in the Bible
00:01:13 as one who “abounded in good deeds
00:01:18 and gifts of mercy.”
00:01:22 Now, how did Tabitha give “gifts of mercy”?
00:01:26 She was a seamstress,
00:01:28 and she used her skill to address a need.
00:01:34 She made garments for needy widows,
00:01:39 and they appreciated her gifts of mercy very much.
00:01:44 So when Tabitha fell ill and died,
00:01:48 the widows were grief-stricken.
00:01:52 The disciples in Joppa, when they learned that the apostle Peter
00:01:55 was just 11 miles (18 km) away in Lydda,
00:01:59 sent and asked him to come without delay to Joppa.
00:02:04 Peter accepted the invitation.
00:02:07 And what did he find in Joppa when he got there?
00:02:11 Grieving widows who bore eloquent testimony
00:02:16 to the gifts of mercy that Tabitha had given them.
00:02:21 Peter was so moved
00:02:24 that with the help of Jehovah’s holy spirit,
00:02:27 he did something that up until that time hadn’t happened
00:02:32 according to the Bible record.
00:02:35 As an apostle, he raised someone from the dead.
00:02:38 He resurrected Tabitha,
00:02:42 and that was a great mercy to her.
00:02:45 The point?
00:02:47 Tabitha gave gifts of mercy
00:02:51 that elicited a merciful act in her behalf.
00:02:56 “Happy are the merciful,
00:02:58 since they will be shown mercy.”
00:03:01 Tabitha did what she could.
00:03:04 She used her skill to fill a need.
00:03:09 A gift of mercy may appear to be
00:03:12 large or small in the eyes of observers.
00:03:16 But when it’s prompted by love and fills a genuine need,
00:03:21 it is appreciated.
00:03:23 And more important, Jehovah notices,
00:03:27 just as he noticed Tabitha’s gifts of mercy.
00:03:32 The second verse that we want to consider
00:03:35 is in James chapter 2.
00:03:38 Turn there with me, please, to James chapter 2,
00:03:41 and we’re going to read verse 13:
00:03:47 “For the one who does not practice mercy
00:03:52 “will have his judgment without mercy.
00:03:56 Mercy triumphs over judgment.”
00:04:00 Now, that’s a thought-provoking statement.
00:04:03 How is it that mercy triumphs over judgment?
00:04:09 In the Bible, Jehovah frankly tells us
00:04:12 that “each of us will render an account
00:04:15 for himself [or herself] to God.”
00:04:19 And when that time comes
00:04:21 and Jehovah evaluates us as individuals,
00:04:25 he takes into consideration
00:04:27 the acts of mercy that we have performed for others.
00:04:32 Now, the thought is not that we buy ourselves out of trouble.
00:04:38 The point is that Jehovah sees the kind acts
00:04:42 that we’re prompted to do by our compassionate heart,
00:04:46 and he takes that into consideration.
00:04:49 Now, James frankly addresses the other side of the coin, doesn’t he?
00:04:54 “The one who does not practice mercy
00:04:57 will have his judgment without mercy.”
00:05:02 A significant way that you and I can demonstrate mercy
00:05:06 is by freely forgiving those who sin against us.
00:05:12 Is that always easy?
00:05:14 No, especially if we’ve been hurt or damaged.
00:05:19 It may be very challenging to make the decision to forgive.
00:05:24 But how important is it
00:05:26 that we demonstrate this kind of mercy?
00:05:31 Well, the answer to that question is found in another illustration that Jesus gave,
00:05:35 recorded in Matthew chapter 18.
00:05:38 There Jesus talked about a slave
00:05:42 who was indebted to his master for 60 million denarii.
00:05:47 It was an impossible debt.
00:05:50 If the slave had lived a thousand lifetimes, he couldn’t have repaid it.
00:05:54 The master ordered the slave and his family and all that he had to be sold.
00:05:59 The slave begged for mercy.
00:06:04 The master was moved with pity
00:06:07 and canceled the entire debt.
00:06:11 What a beautiful gift, or act of mercy!
00:06:18 Well, what happened next?
00:06:21 The forgiven slave turned around
00:06:23 and confronted a fellow slave who owed him 100 denarii
00:06:28 —just a tiny fraction of what he had been forgiven.
00:06:32 But when his fellow slave couldn’t repay the debt,
00:06:35 the forgiven slave had him thrown into prison.
00:06:40 What an injustice!
00:06:41 And when the master learned of it, he was “provoked to wrath.”
00:06:45 He asked: “Should you not also have shown mercy
00:06:49 to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you?”
00:06:55 What is the point of application?
00:06:58 Jesus said: “My heavenly Father
00:07:00 “will also deal with you in the same way
00:07:03 if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart.”
00:07:10 So the matter of forgiveness is just that important.
00:07:15 It’s been said that forgiveness is like money.
00:07:19 It can be spent freely and mercifully on others,
00:07:23 or it can be hoarded stingily.
00:07:27 We can’t afford
00:07:29 to be stingy with forgiveness.
00:07:33 Instead, it’s better to experience the joy
00:07:36 that comes from giving by letting go
00:07:40 and canceling the debt.
00:07:43 Consider the experience of a Christian elder named Miguel.
00:07:48 Miguel’s grandson was murdered.
00:07:52 The murderer was captured, tried, and imprisoned.
00:07:56 Sometime later, Miguel was invited to share in the prison ministry.
00:08:01 Can you guess which prison?
00:08:04 That’s right.
00:08:06 He was asked to go to the very prison
00:08:08 where his grandson’s murderer was incarcerated.
00:08:13 At first, Miguel was hesitant.
00:08:15 He didn’t know whether he should.
00:08:18 But then he decided to accept the invitation.
00:08:22 And sure enough, while in the prison,
00:08:25 he was confronted by the man who murdered his grandson.
00:08:30 How would Miguel handle that situation?
00:08:33 With mildness and in a way that promoted peace,
00:08:37 he invited the man to join him for the Bible study.
00:08:42 To Miguel’s surprise, the man accepted the invitation.
00:08:47 And after the study, he confessed to Miguel
00:08:50 something that he never admitted during his trial.
00:08:54 He confessed to killing Miguel’s grandson.
00:08:58 And then he asked for forgiveness.
00:09:02 What would Miguel do?
00:09:05 Well, as it turned out, he studied with the man,
00:09:09 and the man progressed to the point of baptism
00:09:13 and became one of our brothers.
00:09:16 What a beautiful gift of mercy and forgiveness
00:09:22 and a fine example for all of us!
00:09:25 So, what have we learned?
00:09:28 If we’re merciful, we can be happy because we’ll be shown mercy,
00:09:33 and “mercy triumphs over judgment.”
00:09:38 If we remember those things,
00:09:40 then we will gladly do as Jesus said:
00:09:43 “Go and [act mercifully] yourself.”
