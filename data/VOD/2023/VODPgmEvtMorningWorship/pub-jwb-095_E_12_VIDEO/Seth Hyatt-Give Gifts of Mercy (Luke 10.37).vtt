00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:04.320 line:10% position:50% align:center
I thought for a few minutes this morning

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10% position:50% align:center
we could consider two verses that highlight

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:08.925 line:10% position:50% align:center
the importance

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.828 line:10% position:50% align:center
of being merciful in our actions

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.464 line:10% position:50% align:center
and also highlight the blessings

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.833 line:10% position:50% align:center
that result when we are merciful.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first verse is at Matthew 5:7.

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I invite you to turn there,

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 5:7.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:31.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here in the Sermon on the Mount

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:35.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the happinesses
that introduce this sermon,

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:39.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
[why?] since they will be shown mercy.”

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:52.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is it
that “the merciful” are “shown mercy”?

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:57.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a striking example
can be found in Acts chapter 9,

00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:01.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we’re introduced
to a first-century disciple

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
named Tabitha, or Dorcas.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
She lived in the port city of Joppa.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what reputation did Tabitha have?

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she’s described in the Bible

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one who “abounded in good deeds

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gifts of mercy.”

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did Tabitha give “gifts of mercy”?

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was a seamstress,

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she used her skill to address a need.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
She made garments for needy widows,

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they appreciated
her gifts of mercy very much.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when Tabitha fell ill and died,

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:51.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
the widows were grief-stricken.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples in Joppa,
when they learned that the apostle Peter

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:59.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just 11 miles (18 km) away in Lydda,

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent and asked him
to come without delay to Joppa.

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:07.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter accepted the invitation.

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:11.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what did he find
in Joppa when he got there?

00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:16.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grieving widows who bore eloquent testimony

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the gifts of mercy
that Tabitha had given them.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter was so moved

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:27.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
that with the help of Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:32.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did something
that up until that time hadn’t happened

00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:35.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the Bible record.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
As an apostle,
he raised someone from the dead.

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:42.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
He resurrected Tabitha,

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was a great mercy to her.

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:47.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point?

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:51.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tabitha gave gifts of mercy

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
that elicited a merciful act in her behalf.

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:58.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the merciful,

00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:01.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
since they will be shown mercy.”

00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:04.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tabitha did what she could.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:08.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
She used her skill to fill a need.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
A gift of mercy may appear to be

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
large or small in the eyes of observers.

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when it’s prompted
by love and fills a genuine need,

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:23.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is appreciated.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more important, Jehovah notices,

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:31.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he noticed Tabitha’s gifts of mercy.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second verse that we want to consider

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in James chapter 2.

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn there with me,
please, to James chapter 2,

00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:44.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verse 13:

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the one who does not practice mercy

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:55.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will have his judgment without mercy.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mercy triumphs over judgment.”

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a thought-provoking statement.

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is it that mercy triumphs over judgment?

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:12.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible, Jehovah frankly tells us

00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:15.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “each of us will render an account

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:19.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
for himself [or herself] to God.”

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:21.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when that time comes

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah evaluates us as individuals,

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:27.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
he takes into consideration

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
the acts of mercy
that we have performed for others.

00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:36.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the thought
is not that we buy ourselves out of trouble.

00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:42.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jehovah sees the kind acts

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:46.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re prompted to do
by our compassionate heart,

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he takes that into consideration.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, James frankly addresses
the other side of the coin, doesn’t he?

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who does not practice mercy

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have his judgment without mercy.”

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:06.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
A significant way
that you and I can demonstrate mercy

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by freely forgiving
those who sin against us.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that always easy?

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:19.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, especially if we’ve been hurt or damaged.

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be very challenging
to make the decision to forgive.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how important is it

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:29.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we demonstrate this kind of mercy?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer to that question is found
in another illustration that Jesus gave,

00:05:35.818 --> 00:05:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded in Matthew chapter 18.

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:42.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
There Jesus talked about a slave

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:47.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was indebted
to his master for 60 million denarii.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was an impossible debt.

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:54.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the slave had lived a thousand lifetimes,
he couldn’t have repaid it.

00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:59.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
The master ordered the slave and his family
and all that he had to be sold.

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:02.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
The slave begged for mercy.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
The master was moved with pity

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and canceled the entire debt.

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:16.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful gift, or act of mercy!

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:21.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what happened next?

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:23.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
The forgiven slave turned around

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and confronted a fellow slave
who owed him 100 denarii

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just a tiny fraction
of what he had been forgiven.

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:35.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when his fellow slave
couldn’t repay the debt,

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:40.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
the forgiven slave
had him thrown into prison.

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:41.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an injustice!

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when the master learned of it,
he was “provoked to wrath.”

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
He asked: “Should you not also
have shown mercy

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to your fellow slave
as I showed mercy to you?”

00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the point of application?

00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:00.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “My heavenly Father

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will also deal with you in the same way

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
if each of you does not forgive
your brother from your heart.”

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:14.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the matter of forgiveness
is just that important.

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been said
that forgiveness is like money.

00:07:19.222 --> 00:07:23.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be spent freely
and mercifully on others,

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:25.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it can be hoarded stingily.

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t afford

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be stingy with forgiveness.

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:36.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, it’s better to experience the joy

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:39.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from giving by letting go

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and canceling the debt.

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:48.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the experience
of a Christian elder named Miguel.

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miguel’s grandson was murdered.

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:56.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
The murderer was captured,
tried, and imprisoned.

00:07:56.592 --> 00:08:01.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, Miguel was invited
to share in the prison ministry.

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you guess which prison?

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:06.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was asked to go to the very prison

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:13.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
where his grandson’s murderer
was incarcerated.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, Miguel was hesitant.

00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:18.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t know whether he should.

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:22.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he decided to accept the invitation.

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sure enough, while in the prison,

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:30.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was confronted
by the man who murdered his grandson.

00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:33.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would Miguel handle that situation?

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
With mildness and in a way
that promoted peace,

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
he invited the man
to join him for the Bible study.

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:47.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
To Miguel’s surprise,
the man accepted the invitation.

00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after the study,
he confessed to Miguel

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that he never
admitted during his trial.

00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:58.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
He confessed to killing Miguel’s grandson.

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:01.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he asked for forgiveness.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would Miguel do?

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:09.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as it turned out,
he studied with the man,

00:09:09.732 --> 00:09:13.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the man progressed
to the point of baptism

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:16.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and became one of our brothers.

00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:21.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful
gift of mercy and forgiveness

00:09:22.211 --> 00:09:25.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a fine example for all of us!

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned?

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re merciful, we can be happy
because we’ll be shown mercy,

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:37.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “mercy triumphs over judgment.”

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:40.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we remember those things,
