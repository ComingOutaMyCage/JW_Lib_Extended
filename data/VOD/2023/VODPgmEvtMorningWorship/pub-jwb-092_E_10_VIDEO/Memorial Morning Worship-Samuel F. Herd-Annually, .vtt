00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:04.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
I am delighted to address Jehovah’s people

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:07.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
and their friends worldwide today!

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:08.654 line:10% position:50% align:center
After sundown,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.116 line:10% position:50% align:center
some 20 million of us will have gathered

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.118 line:10% position:50% align:center
in various congregations,

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
groups, and even as individuals

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
to commemorate the death of Jesus.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we begin our discussion,

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will have the text for today read

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:30.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Brother Don Gordon,
a helper to the Publishing Committee.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.180 line:10% position:50% align:center
Today is Tuesday, April 4.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
“‘Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 22:19.”

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would over 20 million people
gather together this evening?

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
One reason is our Scripture text for today,

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 22:19.

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was in the process of inaugurating

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Memorial of his death.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had just broken the unleavened bread

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and passed it to each one present.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
The unleavened bread pictured
Jesus’ perfect, sinless body

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would surrender in death

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the everlasting benefit
to all exercising faith in him.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is at this point that Jesus said the words

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Luke 22:19:

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me,”

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
meaning keep using the wine and bread

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the way to remember my death

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that it will accomplish.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would he say that:
“Keep doing this”?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
He meant exactly what he said:
“Keep doing this.”

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, keep doing it on into the future.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often did he intend
that we “keep doing” it?

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some religions
partake of the bread and wine weekly.

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
They call it communion.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other religions
let the individual congregations determine

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
how often they would perform this activity.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still others instruct that it should be done
four times a year.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses
remember Jesus’ death in this special way,

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:26.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
just once each year
on the anniversary of Jesus’ death?

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there is some logic
to celebrating an anniversary annually

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the precise date of the original event,

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
much like a wedding anniversary.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would you celebrate
a wedding anniversary

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
on any other day of the year

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
or multiple times a year?

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, you would not celebrate
your wedding anniversary

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
every week or every day.

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:58.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly,
the English word “anniversary”

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
is defined
as “the annual recurrence of a date

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
marking an event or occurrence
of notable importance.”

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:14.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ death is certainly
“of notable importance.”

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
not only is it logical to do so once a year

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:22.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there is a Biblical indication

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is what Jesus was requesting,

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
in effect saying:

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep doing this

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:33.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[once a year on the anniversary of my death]

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
in remembrance of me.”

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the Biblical indication

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it should be memorialized
just once a year?

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:47.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at the context
of our text for today

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Luke chapter 22.

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please locate that text.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:57.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our day’s text is verse 19.

00:03:57.591 --> 00:04:00.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was the initial purpose

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:03.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus and his apostles gathering together

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a meal on that date?

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
The date was Nisan 14

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the Jewish, or lunar, calendar
of that time.

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please look at Luke 22:7, 8.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:18.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived,

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered;

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying:

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.’”

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to Jewish law at the time,

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:43.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus had faithfully observed
the Passover once each year.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:47.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now read verses 14 through 17:

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So when the hour came,

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he reclined at the table

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with the apostles.

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he said to them:

00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have greatly desired

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:02.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to eat this Passover with you

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:03.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘before I suffer;

00:05:03.782 --> 00:05:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for I tell you,

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will not eat it again

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.’

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:13.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And accepting a cup,

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:16.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he gave thanks and said:

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:19.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Take this and pass it from one to the other

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:20.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
among yourselves.’”

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:25.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just prior to instituting the Memorial,

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:29.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus celebrated the Jewish Passover,
as we just read

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:33.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 14 through 17.

00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time of the first century,

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:40.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was the custom to pass four cups of wine

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:44.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those seated for the Passover meal.

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cup mentioned in verse 17

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:51.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
was likely the third cup
of the Passover celebration.

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently,
Jesus was saving the fourth cup

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
for instituting the Memorial of his death.

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:03.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question is,

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often was the Passover to be celebrated?

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Exodus chapter 12,

00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:16.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah was preparing the Israelites
to depart Egypt,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
he instituted the Passover

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:23.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remember this event
of notable importance for the nation.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:26.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Exodus 12:14,

00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:28.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah instructed Moses:

00:06:29.743 --> 00:06:34.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This day will serve as a memorial for you,

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must celebrate it

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:38.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a festival to Jehovah

00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:41.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“throughout your generations.

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:43.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a lasting statute,

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:45.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should celebrate it.”

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:49.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
He repeated in verse 17:

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:53.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you must keep this day

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:55.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“throughout your generations

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a lasting statute.”

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it is that Jews observe the Passover

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:04.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
once a year “as a memorial”

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the annual anniversary
of their Exodus from Egypt.

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:13.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after celebrating
the last valid Jewish Passover,

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:16.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus instituted
the Memorial of his death

00:07:16.164 --> 00:07:18.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said “keep doing this,”

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:22.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
his apostles would have known the intent.

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:27.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of observing the Passover
once a year on that date,

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:30.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would now remember the death of Jesus

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
once a year on that same date.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
That seems pretty logical, straightforward,

00:07:36.727 --> 00:07:38.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has a Scriptural precedent.

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:43.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
But many nominal Christian religions
seem to think

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:47.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
that memorializing the event
more often during the year

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be even better.

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:53.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
In part,
this is because of a misunderstanding

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:58.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the intent of 1 Corinthians 11:25.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
In most English translations of the Bible,

00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:03.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is rendered something like this:

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep doing this,
as often as you drink it,

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
in remembrance of me.”

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:11.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some feel that the word “often”

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates that Christ’s death
should be commemorated frequently

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:21.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the sense of as many times as possible.

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:24.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>New World Translation</i>
also rendered the verse similarly

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:28.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
prior to the revised edition being released.

00:08:28.403 --> 00:08:31.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
The wording is an accurate way
of rendering the verse.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:38.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
its intent is easily misinterpreted by many.

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:44.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
just commemorating
the Lord’s Evening Meal once a year

00:08:44.252 --> 00:08:45.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
is often

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:49.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you consider
that it is approaching 2,000 years

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:51.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
since Jesus instituted it.

00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:54.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
That in itself is often.

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, more precisely,

00:08:56.348 --> 00:09:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the context of 1 Corinthians 11:25, 26,

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was discussing, not how often,

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:08.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how the Memorial should be observed.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:14.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the original language,
he did not use the Greek word

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:17.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means “often,” or “frequently.”

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:20.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather,
he used a different Greek word

00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:23.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means “as often as,”

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:26.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it could be expressed “whenever”

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:30.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “every time that you do.”

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:34.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was saying:
‘Every time that you do this,

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:37.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord.’

00:09:38.682 --> 00:09:41.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
To make that even clearer to the reader,

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:43.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
the revised <i>New World Translation </i>

00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:46.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
now renders the text at 1 Corinthians 11:25
this way:

00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:51.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep doing this, whenever you drink it,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
in remembrance of me.”

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as discussed already,

00:09:57.784 --> 00:09:59.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus intended that it be

00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:02.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
a once-a-year replacement

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the annual Passover observance

00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:08.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the anniversary of Jesus’ death.

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be clear,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
following the process Jesus instituted
with the bread and wine

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:21.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
just once a year

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:24.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not mean we only think

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:28.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jesus’ death
on one day of the year.

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:32.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those of you

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:36.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are dedicated
and baptized Witnesses of Jehovah know

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we think of Jesus’ sacrificial death

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day of the year.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is mentioned
in our regular congregation meetings

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:49.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in our family worship.

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:53.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every prayer we say

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:56.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
acknowledges Jesus’ presenting

00:10:56.468 --> 00:10:58.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
the value of his sacrificial death

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:00.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our behalf.

00:11:01.973 --> 00:11:04.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of every prayer,
we acknowledge to God

00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:08.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are praying in Jesus’ name.

00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:10.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.

00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:12.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being imperfect,

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:17.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not have direct access to Jehovah.

00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:20.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he readily accepts our prayer

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we say it

00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:26.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ.

00:11:27.207 --> 00:11:30.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of you viewing this program

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:32.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
are well-aware of the fact

00:11:32.128 --> 00:11:34.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Memorial is primarily

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:38.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those chosen by God for heavenly life.

00:11:38.468 --> 00:11:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
It signifies
their being party to the new covenant

00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:44.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in the Kingdom with Christ.

00:11:44.849 --> 00:11:48.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, all who gather together tonight

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:52.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
will benefit greatly
from being in attendance.

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:55.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us are imperfect,

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:59.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we benefit from Jesus’ ransom sacrifice,

00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:03.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the basis for forgiveness of sins.

00:12:03.577 --> 00:12:06.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of us have the prospect

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:09.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
of everlasting life in the future,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether that is in heaven
for the few anointed ones

00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:15.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in a paradise earth

00:12:15.755 --> 00:12:19.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the millions of others serving Jehovah.

00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:22.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
So only the few anointed ones

00:12:22.637 --> 00:12:26.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
will actually partake 
of the bread and wine tonight.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the high percentage
of those in attendance with an earthly hope,

00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:35.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
very few by comparison
will partake of the emblems.

00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:40.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
In most congregations,
there will likely not be any partakers;

00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
in others, maybe one or two.

00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:46.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is the case,

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:49.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do we pass the emblems
to each one in attendance?

00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:53.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not just invite
any of the anointed to the stage

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:56.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
to partake of the bread and wine?

00:12:56.421 --> 00:12:58.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would save a lot of time

00:12:58.715 --> 00:13:02.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of passing the emblems
to all in the audience.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:08.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
The foremost reason
the emblems are passed before all

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:13.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because that follows
the pattern set by Jesus.

00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:16.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, if an anointed one

00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:20.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes clear his heavenly hope by partaking,

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:22.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
what about those of you

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:26.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
who pass the emblems by without partaking?

00:13:26.618 --> 00:13:29.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too are going on public notice

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:32.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your hope is to live forever

00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:36.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a marvelous paradise here on earth.

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:39.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about it:

00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:44.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
For humans, that is the best life ever!

00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is what Jehovah originally intended
for mankind

00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:50.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he created the first couple
in the garden of Eden.

00:13:52.644 --> 00:13:56.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
What could be better for a human than that?

00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:02.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us eagerly look forward
to the time soon to come

00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:06.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the evil influence of Satan
is taken away from the earth.

00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:09.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and all of his demon followers

00:14:09.828 --> 00:14:14.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be hurled into an abyss of inactivity

00:14:14.624 --> 00:14:17.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 1,000 years.

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:20.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
The resurrected anointed ones

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
will share with Christ
in bringing that about.

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:28.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those alive on earth
during the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:31.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
will share in bringing the earth back

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the condition Jehovah originally intended.

00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:42.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Extending our thoughts
even further into the future,

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the Thousand Year Reign of Christ,

00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:48.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
mankind will have reached perfection,

00:14:48.992 --> 00:14:52.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
similar to Adam and Eve after their creation

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:55.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before their plunge into sin.

00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:57.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 15:24 says:

00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:00.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Next, the end,

00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he hands over the Kingdom

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:04.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his God and Father.<b>”</b>

00:15:06.092 --> 00:15:09.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
By then the Messianic Kingdom
will have fulfilled its role

00:15:09.637 --> 00:15:14.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have an earth filled with perfect people.

00:15:14.392 --> 00:15:17.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, after a final test by Satan,

00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:21.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
any dissenters will be eliminated

00:15:21.274 --> 00:15:24.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Satan and his demons

00:15:24.068 --> 00:15:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be forever destroyed.

00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:30.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time,
Jehovah’s original purpose for the earth

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:32.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be fully realized.

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:37.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
The entire planet
will be full of beautiful people,

00:15:37.248 --> 00:15:40.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
all worshippers of the Universal Sovereign,

00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:44.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
our precious Father, Jehovah God.

00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:50.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gordon, will you please read
the <i>Watchtower</i>  comments for today’s text?

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus spoke to his 11 faithful apostles

00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:58.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about two covenants, or agreements

00:15:58.061 --> 00:16:01.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the new covenant
and the Kingdom covenant.

00:16:01.147 --> 00:16:03.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These covenants opened up the way

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:06.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for those apostles
and a limited number of others

00:16:06.027 --> 00:16:09.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to become kings and priests in heaven.

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:13.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Only the anointed remnant,
who are in these two covenants,

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:15.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may partake of the bread and the wine

00:16:15.453 --> 00:16:17.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the Memorial.

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:20.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah has given them a remarkable hope

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:24.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—to enjoy
immortal and incorruptible life in heaven,

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:28.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to serve alongside
the glorified Jesus Christ

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:31.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the rest of the 144,000

00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:36.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and, above all,
to be in the very presence of Jehovah God!

00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:38.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The anointed recognize

00:16:38.935 --> 00:16:42.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they must remain faithful
until their death.”

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Don.

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:48.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the past few days,
our Bible reading has covered

00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:52.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible accounts
leading up to Jesus’ death.

00:16:52.073 --> 00:16:56.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to follow along
with the reading for today.

00:16:56.286 --> 00:17:01.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
The specific verses
will appear on screen in your language.

00:17:01.124 --> 00:17:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with the reading,
enjoy the new artwork

00:17:04.627 --> 00:17:07.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been prepared this year.

00:17:09.924 --> 00:17:12.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the first day of the Unleavened Bread,

00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:15.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the disciples came to Jesus, saying:

00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:17.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Where do you want us to prepare for you

00:17:17.765 --> 00:17:19.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to eat the Passover?’

00:17:19.726 --> 00:17:20.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said:

00:17:21.436 --> 00:17:23.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go into the city to So-and-so

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and say to him, “The Teacher says:

00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:29.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“‘My appointed time is near;

00:17:29.152 --> 00:17:31.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“‘I will celebrate the Passover

00:17:31.154 --> 00:17:33.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with my disciples at your home.’”’

00:17:34.324 --> 00:17:36.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them

00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prepared for the Passover.”

00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:51.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived,

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:55.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered;

00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:59.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying:

00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:02.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.’

00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They said to him:

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:07.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Where do you want us to get it ready?’

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to them:

00:18:08.691 --> 00:18:11.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! When you enter into the city,

00:18:11.778 --> 00:18:14.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a man carrying an earthenware water jar

00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:15.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘will meet you.

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:18.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Follow him into the house that he enters.

“‘where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’”

00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:30.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And that man will show you

00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a large, furnished upper room.

“Get it ready there.’

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:39.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they left and found it just as he had told them,

00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:41.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they prepared for the Passover.”

00:18:52.068 --> 00:18:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When evening came,

00:18:53.277 --> 00:18:56.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“While they were eating, he said:

“‘Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.’ 

00:19:04.872 --> 00:19:08.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Being very much grieved at this,

00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each and every one began to say to him:

00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:15.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Lord, it is not I, is it?’

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:17.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In reply he said:

00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:21.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl

00:19:21.347 --> 00:19:24.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is the one who will betray me.

“‘True, the Son of man is going away,

“‘just as it is written about him,

00:19:29.772 --> 00:19:31.774 line:90% position:50% align:center

if he had not been born.’

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:45.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Judas, who was about to betray him, replied:

00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:48.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is not I, is it, Rabbi?’

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to him:

00:19:51.002 --> 00:19:53.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You yourself said it.’

00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:00.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and after saying a blessing, he broke it,

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and giving it to the disciples, he said:

00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Take, eat. This means my body.’

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And taking a cup, he offered thanks

00:20:14.984 --> 00:20:17.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and gave it to them, saying:

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Drink out of it, all of you,

00:20:19.781 --> 00:20:22.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for this means my “blood of the covenant,”

00:20:23.242 --> 00:20:25.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘which is to be poured out in behalf of many

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:27.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for forgiveness of sins.

00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:29.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But I say to you:

00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:31.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will by no means drink again

“‘any of this product of the vine

00:20:33.753 --> 00:20:36.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘until that day when I drink it new with you

00:20:36.923 --> 00:20:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Kingdom of my Father.’

00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:44.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Finally, after singing praises,

00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:47.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they went out to the Mount of Olives.

00:20:50.478 --> 00:20:52.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus said to them:

00:20:52.814 --> 00:20:54.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘All of you will be stumbled

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:57.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in connection with me on this night,

“‘and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.”

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:06.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But after I have been raised up,

00:21:06.744 --> 00:21:09.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’

00:21:09.413 --> 00:21:13.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Peter, in response, said to him:

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:15.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Although all the others

00:21:15.002 --> 00:21:17.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘are stumbled in connection with you,

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:19.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will never be stumbled!’

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:21.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to him:

00:21:21.717 --> 00:21:23.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Truly I say to you, 

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘on this night, before a rooster crows,

00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:31.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will disown me three times.’

00:21:31.894 --> 00:21:33.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peter said to him:

00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:37.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Even if I should have to die with you,

00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:39.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will by no means disown you.’

00:21:40.528 --> 00:21:43.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All the other disciples also said the same thing.

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:48.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus came with them

00:21:48.452 --> 00:21:50.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the spot called Gethsemane,

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to the disciples:

00:21:54.876 --> 00:21:59.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Sit down here while I go over there and pray.’

00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:02.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And taking along Peter

00:22:02.717 --> 00:22:04.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the two sons of Zebʹe·dee,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he began to feel grieved

00:22:06.804 --> 00:22:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to be greatly troubled.

00:22:08.931 --> 00:22:10.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he said to them:

00:22:10.933 --> 00:22:15.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am deeply grieved, even to death.

00:22:15.813 --> 00:22:19.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stay here and keep on the watch with me.’

00:22:19.942 --> 00:22:21.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And going a little way forward,

00:22:21.944 --> 00:22:25.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he fell facedown, praying:

00:22:25.573 --> 00:22:28.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My Father, if it is possible,

00:22:28.993 --> 00:22:32.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘let this cup pass away from me.

“Yet, not as I will, but as you will.’

00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:40.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He returned to the disciples

00:22:40.171 --> 00:22:42.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and found them sleeping,

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:44.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to Peter:

00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:47.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Could you not so much as keep on the watch

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for one hour with me?

00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:54.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Keep on the watch and pray continually,

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:57.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:22:57.897 --> 00:23:00.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The spirit, of course, is eager,

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the flesh is weak.’

00:23:04.487 --> 00:23:08.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Again, a second time, he went off and prayed:

00:23:08.783 --> 00:23:10.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My Father,

00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:14.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘if it is not possible for this to pass away

00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:16.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘unless I drink it,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let your will take place.’

00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:22.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he came again and found them sleeping,

00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for their eyes were heavy.

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:28.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So leaving them,

00:23:28.844 --> 00:23:31.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he again went off and prayed for a third time,

00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:34.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saying once more the same thing.

00:23:37.687 --> 00:23:41.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he returned to the disciples and said to them: 

00:23:41.023 --> 00:23:43.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘At such a time as this,

“While he was still speaking,

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“look! Judas, one of the Twelve, came

00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:11.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs,

“and the elders of the people.

00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying:

“‘Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one;

“take him into custody.’

00:24:26.235 --> 00:24:30.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And going straight up to Jesus, he said:

00:24:30.448 --> 00:24:32.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Greetings, Rabbi!’

00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and gave him a tender kiss.

00:24:36.203 --> 00:24:37.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jesus said to him:

“‘Fellow, for what purpose are you present?’

00:24:44.253 --> 00:24:47.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then they came forward and seized Jesus

00:24:47.173 --> 00:24:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:52.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But look! one of those with Jesus

00:24:52.428 --> 00:24:55.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“reached out his hand and drew his sword

00:24:59.477 --> 00:25:02.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
