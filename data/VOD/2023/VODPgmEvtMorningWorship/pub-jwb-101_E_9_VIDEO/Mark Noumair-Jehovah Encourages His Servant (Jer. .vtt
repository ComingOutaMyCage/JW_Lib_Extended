00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:05.021 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Great Encourager.

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
He’s the primary Giver of strength

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:08.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
to his people.

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
So let’s use Jeremiah,

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:11.995 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah, as an example

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:14.097 line:10% position:50% align:center
of one whom Jehovah encouraged,

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.699 line:10% position:50% align:center
and let’s see what we can learn.

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Jeremiah chapter 1.

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:24.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jeremiah was about 25 years old
when he was commissioned to be a prophet,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he didn’t feel qualified.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: ‘I’m but a boy.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not ready
for this serious responsibility.’

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jeremiah need?

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah needed reassurance,
and he needed encouragement.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would Jehovah do?

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s find out
in chapter 1 and verse 8:

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid
because of their appearance,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ‘I am with you to save you,’
declares Jehovah.”

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am with you [, Jeremiah].”

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:55.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did that mean?

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:57.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My, holy spirit’—

00:00:57.107 --> 00:00:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s holy spirit would give Jeremiah

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
the needed strength and encouragement

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain his zeal in God’s service

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:07.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some 60 years.

00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:10.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
That inexhaustible spirit
would encourage Jeremiah

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:14.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
month after month and year after year.

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
He needed encouragement.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
He got it.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not let him down.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in addition to Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:27.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
what else did Jehovah do
for Jeremiah to encourage him?

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jeremiah tells us.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:32.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open up to chapter 15

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jeremiah chapter 15—

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:38.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 16.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah says: “Your words were found.”

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s pause there.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your words were found”

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
—words available to Jeremiah—

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:53.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
worthy, inspired words,

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:57.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inspired documents and writings of Moses,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua, Samuel,

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:02.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
David, Solomon.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jeremiah just didn’t keep
those inspired writings at a distance.

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:12.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what he says: “And I ate them.”

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:15.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah took the time to eat,

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:19.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
to digest, and to meditate on God’s Word.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:26.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was Jeremiah who compiled 1 and 2 Kings.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah hit the books.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
He studied.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:33.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
He researched the documents
that were available to him.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah mentioned the history of the book

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the history “Book of the Kings”—

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:41.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
33 times.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
He must have drawn encouragement
by examining prophecies,

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:48.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
prophecies that he saw
come true in his very day.

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:50.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw them being fulfilled.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was Jeremiah who was inspired
to record the prophecy

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Kings 13:2,

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
where an unnamed man of God

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time of Jeroboam
foretold that a man,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
a person named Josiah,
would act against false worship.

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:19.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that prophecy was uttered some 300 years

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Jeremiah was even born.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how this must have strengthened Jeremiah

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:27.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do the research and to meditate

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this prophecy and to live
at the time of its fulfillment!

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adding to Jeremiah’s joy,
Josiah was his good friend.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:39.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no wonder he says there in verse 16:

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And your word became to me

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:46.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
the exultation
and the rejoicing of my heart.”

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
So look what we’ve learned so far.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) “Your words were found.”

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) “I ate them.”

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) It resulted 
in “the rejoicing of my heart.”

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take another example.

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:11.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wondered what helped Jeremiah,

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite being persecuted,

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep warning wicked kings

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:20.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Jehoiakim and Zedekiah to serve Jehovah?

00:04:20.877 --> 00:04:23.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where would he get that encouragement from?

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:29.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider this
at chapter 15 and verse 4:

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I [Jehovah speaking]
will make them [God’s people]

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:42.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an object of horror
to all the kingdoms of the earth

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah,

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king of Judah,
for what he did in Jerusalem”

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for what Manasseh did in Jerusalem.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, again, Jeremiah
had done extensive research

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:01.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the reign of the kings,
including Manasseh.

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was Jeremiah that recorded
how Manasseh “set up altars to Baal.”

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spilled “ innocent blood.”

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had “his own [sons]
pass through the fire.”

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He did on a grand scale
what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.”

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Manasseh was wicked.

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet,

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah would be aware
of Manasseh’s repentance

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
since Manasseh died
when Jeremiah was about ten years old.

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s true that Jeremiah
researched Manasseh’s terrible conduct,

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also researched his repentance.

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how encouraging
that must have been to Jeremiah

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
(to see the value of continuing
to urge wicked kings

00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Jehoiakim and Zedekiah

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
to seek Jehovah’s mercy,

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:53.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying to himself: ‘If Manasseh,
who was notorious for idolatry and bloodshed,

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
could repent and be forgiven,
what about you, Zedekiah?’)!

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point?

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:01.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word
—researching into God’s Word—

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:04.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
energized Jeremiah

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he continued to build his faith
and his trust and his confidence

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah during difficult times.

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:15.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, humans did fail Jeremiah; it’s true.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:21.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t give him the encouragement
he needed when he needed it; it’s true.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah never failed Jeremiah.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helped him.

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it the same with us?

00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times we expect encouragement,

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we might not get it
at the time we expect it,

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:35.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah will always give it to us.

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:37.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll never fail us.

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want encouragement?

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then go to the Source of encouragement.

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even a few minutes each day

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:51.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just a few minutes
of Bible reading and meditation each day

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:55.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us of how our actions
touch Jehovah’s feelings.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
We gain encouragement

00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
by thinking about how Jehovah

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
views us and our relationship with him.

00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:10.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a suggestion:

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we need help
to jump-start daily Bible reading,

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:20.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
then try this: Start with Psalm 119.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
This psalm is distinguished by being divided

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
into 22 stanzas with 8 verses each.

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:33.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes about one minute
to read these eight verses.

00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
And fall in love with those verses.

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:38.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Jehovah speaking to us.

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:45.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then choose one verse out of the eight

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:49.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just one—
a verse that you want to lock on to;

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:51.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
you want to sink down deep.

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:55.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about that one verse,
and ask yourself some questions.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps it’s verse 11 of Psalm 119:

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:04.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘In my heart I have treasured up your sayings

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I may not sin against you.’

00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now stir your feelings.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stir your heart with a few questions:

00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:17.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How many scriptures
have I treasured up in my heart

00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:19.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that I may not sin against Jehovah?

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:24.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Can I list two or three
on a piece of paper if I had to do so

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—scriptures that are conduct-altering,

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:30.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
scriptures that really do help me
in times of temptation or trial?’

00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that only took a few minutes to do,
maybe five minutes,

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:39.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the value is deep
—a lot of value for a little time.

00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:44.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then if you have more time,
tap on that <i>Research Guide</i>,

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it explodes with more information
that can help us

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:50.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our meditations and love for Jehovah God.

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:52.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it doesn’t take long.

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:57.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s consistent,
and we “form a longing for” God’s Word.

00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:00.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
In less than two months,
we’ll have eaten and digested

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 176 precious thoughts of Jehovah God.

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Source of encouragement.

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:13.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the Great Encourager,
and he wants to encourage us.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:17.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Jeremiah, we need to eat, digest,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and think deeply
on the encouragement that Jehovah

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
does give us through his inspired Word,

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the result will be

00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:29.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘the exultation and rejoicing of our hearts.’
