00:00:01.438 --> 00:00:03.941 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, we are talking about worldly desires,

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:06.777 line:10% position:50% align:center
and worldly desires may entice us

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
to do wrong for selfish advantage.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
An expression of this selfishness is

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:17.121 line:10% position:50% align:center
the worldly desire of instant gratification.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our theme today is, therefore,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reject the Desire of Instant Gratification.”

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:25.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will answer two questions:

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is instant gratification a problem?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how does God’s undeserved kindness

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to resist instant gratification?

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
To our first question,
Why is instant gratification a problem?

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is instant gratification?

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, instant, or immediate, gratification

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
means exchanging a future benefit

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to obtain a less rewarding

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
but more immediate benefit.

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
A prominent example is Esau.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was willing to trade his birthright

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its future blessings for a quick meal.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
While this example shows

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the desire of immediate gratification
has always existed,

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
today it’s more of a problem.

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:21.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because technology and social media
—with the world at our fingertips—

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes it harder to delay gratification.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything is possible and without waiting.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, almost all advertisements

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
contain offers
for paying later or loan financing.

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:40.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why wait and save before buying?

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, many ignore the warning
at Proverbs 22:7

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experience the consequences of being

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a slave to the lender.”

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or another example:

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the effect instant gratification

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:58.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have on relationships.

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are upset with somebody,

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
it might make us feel good

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send an angry text message.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:09.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we know that first

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
taking the time to examine our feelings
—the feelings of the other—

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and following them
with a face-to-face communication

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:20.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the better and more successful course,

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
although more time-consuming.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third example: Today, you can easily find

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:30.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
a marriage partner by using the Internet.

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:34.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by doing this,
you are creating instant gratification.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, statistics reveal the short lifespan
of those relationships.

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:42.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, on the other hand,
highlights the value of patience.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes time to get to know ourselves,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to know the prospective partner,

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:51.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prepare a healthy relationship.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
This makes a successful marriage
much more likely,

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:59.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
resulting in lasting benefits.

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were just a few examples

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:04.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the attitude that has shaped
our modern world.

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we live in a society

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is governed by greed

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its bad consequences.

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to our second question:

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does God’s undeserved kindness

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to resist instant gratification?

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:25.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, please, open to our text for today,

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is Titus chapter 2, to find out why

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:32.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
we talk about God’s undeserved kindness.

00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us read here, Titus chapter 2,
beginning with verse 11.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:41.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read:
“For the undeserved kindness of God

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been manifested,
bringing salvation to all sorts of people.”

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now our day’s text comes:

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It [the undeserved kindness of God]

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:56.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“trains us to reject ungodliness

00:03:56.298 --> 00:03:59.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worldly desires.”

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:04.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice what helps us
to reject worldly desire?

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is, according to verse 11,
God’s undeserved kindness.

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, what exactly is
God’s undeserved kindness,

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how does it help us to reject

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:21.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
the desire of instant gratification?

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the word translated here
as “undeserved kindness”

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:28.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
conveys the thought of a free gift,

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:32.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
of something that is unearned and unmerited.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:37.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gift is expressed in various ways.

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here in verse 11,

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:43.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul refers
to the greatest expression of this

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:47.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
godly undeserved kindness
—the ransom sacrifice of Jesus.

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:50.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah forgives us our sins,

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
which opens the door

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:56.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
to many other wonderful blessings.

00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:58.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can enjoy
a wonderful, close relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:08.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
This good relationship
will enable us to resist pressure.

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:09.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:13.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us illustrate this
by means of a situation in David’s life.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
For quite some time,
David had to flee from Saul.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:22.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we turn to 1 Samuel chapter 24,

00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:26.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that David was hiding in a cave.

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:29.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was this cave
that King Saul entered to rest.

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:33.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would David now give in to the temptation

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kill Saul and end the time
of being in the wilderness

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:40.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now finally reign as king?

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:44.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us read here at 1 Samuel 24:4

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how David’s men encouraged him

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:49.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find instant gratification.

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:53.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in verse 4, we read:
“David’s men said to him:

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is the day on which Jehovah
is saying to you, 

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Look! I am giving your enemy
into your hand,

00:05:59.922 --> 00:06:03.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can do to him
whatever seems good to you.”’”

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:07.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would David do?

00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:11.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that David resisted the temptation.

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:12.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why?

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at verse 6.

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:16.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read: “He [David] said to his men:

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:23.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that I should do such a thing to my lord,
the anointed of Jehovah,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘by lifting my hand against him,

00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:29.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he is the anointed of Jehovah.’”

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:31.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
David enjoyed

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:39.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew God’s thinking,
and he was able to apply godly principles.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
The many prayers recorded in the Bible

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
show us that David
put all his trust in Jehovah.

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made him wait.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chose delayed gratification.

00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how are we equipped to resist
the worldly desire of instant gratification?

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:03.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
if we approach our close Friend, Jehovah,

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to Philippians 4:6, 7, in prayer,

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:11.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
then His peace ‘will guard our heart.’

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:16.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we further prepare our hearts
by our regular studies.

00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:20.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
They help us to get acquainted
with Jehovah’s principles.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:24.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, if we want something instantly

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a price that could endanger
our good priorities in our life,

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
then our close relationship with Jehovah
helps us

00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:36.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
to choose the long-term benefit
over instant gratification.

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:41.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second way of how
the undeserved kindness of God

00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:44.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to resist instant gratification is

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:48.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking into the future and seeing
the bigger picture.

00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:51.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jesus did.

00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 12:2,

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:56.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul described Jesus’ future

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the joy that was set before him.”

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:03.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus saw his future in heaven,

00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:06.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he did not give in

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:09.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
to create immediate relief.

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:14.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
And take the example
when Satan offered to him “all the kingdoms.”

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus understood the bigger picture;
he understood his role in God’s purpose,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this allowed him to resist the temptation

00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:26.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to not go for the immediate benefit

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
but resist the offer.

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:31.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are we not doing the same?

00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:35.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
We visualize ourselves
being in Jehovah’s new world

00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:39.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
—welcoming loved ones, teaching them.

00:08:39.414 --> 00:08:43.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping this conviction
—this hope—alive

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:47.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to resist the desire
