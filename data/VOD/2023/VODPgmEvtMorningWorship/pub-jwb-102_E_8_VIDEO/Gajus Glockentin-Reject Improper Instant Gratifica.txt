00:00:01 Now, we are talking about worldly desires,
00:00:03 and worldly desires may entice us
00:00:06 to do wrong for selfish advantage.
00:00:10 An expression of this selfishness is
00:00:13 the worldly desire of instant gratification.
00:00:17 Our theme today is, therefore,
00:00:19 “Reject the Desire of Instant Gratification.”
00:00:23 We will answer two questions:
00:00:25 Why is instant gratification a problem?
00:00:29 And how does God’s undeserved kindness
00:00:33 help us to resist instant gratification?
00:00:36 To our first question, Why is instant gratification a problem?
00:00:40 What is instant gratification?
00:00:43 Now, instant, or immediate, gratification
00:00:46 means exchanging a future benefit
00:00:50 in order to obtain a less rewarding
00:00:53 but more immediate benefit.
00:00:57 A prominent example is Esau.
00:00:59 He was willing to trade his birthright
00:01:02 with its future blessings for a quick meal.
00:01:06 While this example shows
00:01:08 that the desire of immediate gratification has always existed,
00:01:11 today it’s more of a problem.
00:01:14 Why?
00:01:16 Because technology and social media —with the world at our fingertips—
00:01:21 makes it harder to delay gratification.
00:01:24 Everything is possible and without waiting.
00:01:28 For instance, almost all advertisements
00:01:32 contain offers for paying later or loan financing.
00:01:37 So why wait and save before buying?
00:01:40 Sadly, many ignore the warning at Proverbs 22:7
00:01:45 and experience the consequences of being
00:01:47 “a slave to the lender.”
00:01:51 Or another example:
00:01:53 Think of the effect instant gratification
00:01:55 can have on relationships.
00:01:58 If we are upset with somebody,
00:02:01 it might make us feel good
00:02:03 to send an angry text message.
00:02:06 However, we know that first
00:02:09 taking the time to examine our feelings —the feelings of the other—
00:02:13 and following them with a face-to-face communication
00:02:17 is the better and more successful course,
00:02:20 although more time-consuming.
00:02:23 A third example: Today, you can easily find
00:02:26 a marriage partner by using the Internet.
00:02:30 And by doing this, you are creating instant gratification.
00:02:34 Yet, statistics reveal the short lifespan of those relationships.
00:02:39 Jehovah, on the other hand, highlights the value of patience.
00:02:42 It takes time to get to know ourselves,
00:02:46 to get to know the prospective partner,
00:02:48 and to prepare a healthy relationship.
00:02:51 This makes a successful marriage much more likely,
00:02:55 resulting in lasting benefits.
00:02:59 These were just a few examples
00:03:01 of the attitude that has shaped our modern world.
00:03:04 Yes, we live in a society
00:03:07 that is governed by greed
00:03:09 with its bad consequences.
00:03:12 That brings us to our second question:
00:03:15 How does God’s undeserved kindness
00:03:18 help us to resist instant gratification?
00:03:22 Let us, please, open to our text for today,
00:03:25 this is Titus chapter 2, to find out why
00:03:28 we talk about God’s undeserved kindness.
00:03:32 Let us read here, Titus chapter 2, beginning with verse 11.
00:03:37 There we read: “For the undeserved kindness of God
00:03:41 has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people.”
00:03:46 And now our day’s text comes:
00:03:48 “It [the undeserved kindness of God]
00:03:53 “trains us to reject ungodliness
00:03:56 and worldly desires.”
00:03:59 Did you notice what helps us to reject worldly desire?
00:04:05 It is, according to verse 11, God’s undeserved kindness.
00:04:10 Yet, what exactly is God’s undeserved kindness,
00:04:14 and how does it help us to reject
00:04:17 the desire of instant gratification?
00:04:21 Now, the word translated here as “undeserved kindness”
00:04:24 conveys the thought of a free gift,
00:04:28 of something that is unearned and unmerited.
00:04:34 This gift is expressed in various ways.
00:04:37 And here in verse 11,
00:04:39 Paul refers to the greatest expression of this
00:04:43 godly undeserved kindness —the ransom sacrifice of Jesus.
00:04:47 Jehovah forgives us our sins,
00:04:50 which opens the door
00:04:52 to many other wonderful blessings.
00:04:56 For example,
00:04:58 we can enjoy a wonderful, close relationship with Jehovah.
00:05:03 This good relationship will enable us to resist pressure.
00:05:08 How?
00:05:09 Let us illustrate this by means of a situation in David’s life.
00:05:13 For quite some time, David had to flee from Saul.
00:05:18 Now, if we turn to 1 Samuel chapter 24,
00:05:22 we see that David was hiding in a cave.
00:05:26 And it was this cave that King Saul entered to rest.
00:05:30 Would David now give in to the temptation
00:05:33 and kill Saul and end the time of being in the wilderness
00:05:37 and now finally reign as king?
00:05:40 Let us read here at 1 Samuel 24:4
00:05:44 and see how David’s men encouraged him
00:05:46 to find instant gratification.
00:05:49 Here in verse 4, we read: “David’s men said to him:
00:05:53 “‘This is the day on which Jehovah is saying to you,
00:05:57 “‘“Look! I am giving your enemy into your hand,
00:05:59 and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.”’”
00:06:04 So, what would David do?
00:06:07 We know that David resisted the temptation.
00:06:11 But why?
00:06:12 Let’s look at verse 6.
00:06:13 Here we read: “He [David] said to his men:
00:06:16 “‘It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint
00:06:19 “‘that I should do such a thing to my lord, the anointed of Jehovah,
00:06:23 “‘by lifting my hand against him,
00:06:25 for he is the anointed of Jehovah.’”
00:06:29 David enjoyed
00:06:31 a close relationship with Jehovah.
00:06:34 He knew God’s thinking, and he was able to apply godly principles.
00:06:39 The many prayers recorded in the Bible
00:06:42 show us that David put all his trust in Jehovah.
00:06:47 This made him wait.
00:06:49 He chose delayed gratification.
00:06:54 Now, how are we equipped to resist the worldly desire of instant gratification?
00:06:58 Remember, if we approach our close Friend, Jehovah,
00:07:04 according to Philippians 4:6, 7, in prayer,
00:07:08 then His peace ‘will guard our heart.’
00:07:11 And then we further prepare our hearts by our regular studies.
00:07:16 They help us to get acquainted with Jehovah’s principles.
00:07:20 So, then, if we want something instantly
00:07:24 at a price that could endanger our good priorities in our life,
00:07:28 then our close relationship with Jehovah helps us
00:07:31 to choose the long-term benefit over instant gratification.
00:07:38 A second way of how the undeserved kindness of God
00:07:41 helps us to resist instant gratification is
00:07:44 looking into the future and seeing the bigger picture.
00:07:48 This is what Jesus did.
00:07:51 At Hebrews 12:2,
00:07:53 the apostle Paul described Jesus’ future
00:07:56 as “the joy that was set before him.”
00:08:00 Jesus saw his future in heaven,
00:08:03 and he did not give in
00:08:06 to create immediate relief.
00:08:09 And take the example when Satan offered to him “all the kingdoms.”
00:08:14 Jesus understood the bigger picture; he understood his role in God’s purpose,
00:08:18 and this allowed him to resist the temptation
00:08:23 and to not go for the immediate benefit
00:08:26 but resist the offer.
00:08:29 So are we not doing the same?
00:08:31 We visualize ourselves being in Jehovah’s new world
00:08:35 —welcoming loved ones, teaching them.
00:08:39 Keeping this conviction —this hope—alive
00:08:43 helps us to resist the desire
00:08:47 of instant gratification
00:08:49 and to wait for the long-term benefit.
00:08:52 So in conclusion,
00:08:55 resisting the desire of instant gratification
00:08:57 helps us to make wise decisions
00:09:00 when it comes to material pursuits or relationships.
00:09:03 Jehovah’s undeserved kindness in the form
00:09:05 of a close relationship helps us
00:09:07 to prepare our heart today.
00:09:10 And the gift of our wonderful hope
00:09:13 helps us to see ourselves in the future
00:09:16 with all the benefits that outweigh,
00:09:19 by far, instant gratification.
