00:00:01 “Lovers of money”—that didn’t sound too bad.
00:00:05 I mean, compared to “betrayers,” “fierce,”
00:00:08 “slanderers,” and other traits
00:00:10 listed in 2 Timothy 3,
00:00:13 what’s so bad about being a lover of money?
00:00:17 A lot.
00:00:19 Once a person loves money more than anything or anyone else,
00:00:23 it corrupts them.
00:00:25 For example, let’s consider what lovers of money
00:00:28 have done—the effect on big business.
00:00:32 Now, businesses that produce a good product at a fair price,
00:00:36 consumers and others appreciate.
00:00:39 However, when a business is run by lovers of money,
00:00:43 they cut corners, they lie about risks,
00:00:47 and they accept or offer bribes or basically do anything they can
00:00:51 to raise their stock price or increase profits.
00:00:54 We’ve all seen the constant upgrades
00:00:57 and the completely false advertisements.
00:01:00 And many people today just accept that as so common and so normal
00:01:05 that they say, “It’s just business.”
00:01:09 How have lovers of money affected governments?
00:01:13 Well, when lovers of money get into power,
00:01:16 government for the people becomes government for them.
00:01:20 Public money is diverted into private bank accounts
00:01:24 that makes these politicians and government leaders very wealthy
00:01:29 —the power that love of money has to corrupt
00:01:33 even the most well-meaning men and women in politics.
00:01:37 We can see it in full effect around us.
00:01:40 It’s an everyday occurrence.
00:01:42 No government on earth is immune to the effect
00:01:45 that lovers of money has on government.
00:01:48 In fact, the suffering of many people around the world
00:01:52 can be traced back to greed
00:01:54 and lovers of money in government.
00:01:57 Well, what effect has lovers of money
00:02:00 had on Christendom and false religion?
00:02:03 Well, once Christendom’s priests or ministers
00:02:06 started to charge for their services
00:02:09 or press their congregations very hard for money,
00:02:13 it had a corrupting influence on the worship of God.
00:02:17 Money changed how religion worked.
00:02:21 It changed the relationship
00:02:23 between people and ministers to their congregation.
00:02:27 I mean, to illustrate for a moment: Think of a wife
00:02:30 that goes to her husband and hands him a bill
00:02:33 for all the work she’s done in the family,
00:02:36 and the husband turns around and gives her a bill
00:02:39 for all the work he’s done in the family.
00:02:41 Do you think that might change the relationship in the family
00:02:45 and about how they feel about one another and the work they do?
00:02:48 Of course it would.
00:02:50 Jehovah inspired Paul to see the corrupting influence
00:02:54 that lovers of money would have on religion
00:02:58 at 2 Timothy 4:3, 4
00:03:04 —2 Timothy 4:3, 4.
00:03:07 He says: “For there will be a period of time
00:03:09 “when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching,
00:03:12 “but according to their own desires,
00:03:14 “they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled.
00:03:19 “They will turn away from listening to the truth
00:03:22 and give attention to false stories.”
00:03:25 Well, today, as mentioned in these verses,
00:03:29 many religions are based on tickle-their-ears messages,
00:03:33 false stories, platitudes,
00:03:36 and kind of feel-good-about-yourself messages.
00:03:39 You know, when I searched on the Internet about the effect of money on religion,
00:03:43 I came across several websites
00:03:46 that explain how to form your own religion
00:03:50 (what to say and what to do),
00:03:52 with the whole purpose of getting rich.
00:03:56 So once a religion is run by lovers of money,
00:04:01 they’re no longer lovers of truth, or lovers of God’s Word.
00:04:05 Sermons are no longer about Bible truth;
00:04:08 they’re more about what people are willing to pay for.
00:04:12 People are even told that they can buy God’s forgiveness.
00:04:17 Basically, you can bribe God not to punish you.
00:04:21 It kind of goes like this: You’ve done bad.
00:04:25 God is going to punish you.
00:04:27 So give money to me and the church,
00:04:29 and God will forgive you.
00:04:32 You see, this scam and variations of it
00:04:35 have a long history.
00:04:37 Indulgences sold by the Catholic Church back in the 16th century
00:04:41 are very good examples of such greed.
00:04:44 Indulgences were basically the church saying
00:04:46 that you can pay for God not to punish you.
00:04:49 The Awake!  of August 1989 explained how Martin Luther
00:04:53 felt about the Catholic Church  selling such indulgences.
00:04:57 It says: “The selling of indulgences originated during the Crusades,
00:05:01 “when they were granted to believers willing to risk their lives in a ‘holy’ war.
00:05:05 “[But] later they were extended to people
00:05:08 “offering financial support to the church.
00:05:11 “Soon, indulgences became a convenient method of raising money . . . ,
00:05:15 “‘the bingo of the sixteenth century.’
00:05:19 “With the sharp tongue for which he became noted,
00:05:22 “[Martin] Luther asked:
00:05:24 “‘If the pope does have the power to release anyone from purgatory
00:05:28 “‘[basically on the basis of indulgences of the money],
00:05:31 “‘why in the name of love
00:05:34 does he not abolish purgatory by letting everyone out?’”
00:05:40 Well, this really should not surprise us.
00:05:43 The biggest bribe on record
00:05:45 was the one Satan offered to Jesus.
00:05:48 Satan said: ‘I will give you [bribe you]
00:05:52 ‘all the kingdoms of the world [basically pay you]
00:05:55 if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.’
00:05:59 Now let’s contrast Satan’s and Christendom’s view on love of money
00:06:04 with Jesus’ words at Matthew 10:8
00:06:11 —Matthew 10:8.
00:06:13 Now, here Jesus was giving some instructions
00:06:15 to his disciples about the message
00:06:17 they should give as they go out and preach the Kingdom.
00:06:20 And he told them: “Cure the sick, raise up the dead,
00:06:24 “make lepers clean, expel demons.
00:06:28 You received free, give free.”
00:06:31 Now, why, after stating
00:06:33 these beautiful, wonderful things they could do for people,
00:06:36 would Jesus say something like, “You received free, give free”?
00:06:41 Because Jesus knew that the love of money could corrupt
00:06:46 these wonderful miracles that they could do for others.
00:06:50 I mean, Jesus had seen how money
00:06:53 had corrupted many
00:06:55 over the years he had seen mankind.
00:06:58 For example, when he saw—
00:07:00 When Naaman wanted to give expensive gifts to Elisha
00:07:04 because he had cured him of his leprosy,
00:07:08 Elisha would not have any of it.
00:07:11 See, Elisha knew that it was wrong
00:07:14 to try to profit from the operation of God’s holy spirit.
00:07:19 Gehazi, though, couldn’t resist.
00:07:22 His love of money
00:07:24 totally corrupted his faithful service.
00:07:28 Of course, today, we can’t cure leprosy or raise the dead.
00:07:33 But the lesson that Jesus gave here
00:07:36 at Matthew 10:8 is still very applicable to us:
00:07:40 “You received free, give free.”
00:07:44 It’s a clear message.
00:07:46 Don’t accept money for the work of the holy spirit.
00:07:51 The Kingdom message and its blessings
00:07:54 are simply not for sale.
00:07:57 Now, we’re truly blessed to be part
00:07:59 of God’s spirit-directed organization,
00:08:02 who are lovers of God rather than lovers of money.
00:08:06 We don’t have collections at our meetings or our conventions.
00:08:09 Donations are made discreetly,
00:08:12 and funds are used wisely and modestly.
00:08:16 And we also follow the Bible’s requirement for elders.
00:08:20 In 1 Timothy chapter 3,
00:08:22 it says that elders should not be “a lover of money.”
00:08:27 See, how important it is that the elders —those taking the lead—
00:08:30 should not be a lover of money!
00:08:32 Otherwise, it can corrupt their relationship with the congregation.
00:08:36 Interestingly, that expression
00:08:38 that they should not be “a lover of money”
00:08:41 is the same expression that’s used in 2 Timothy 3
00:08:44 about how other people would be lovers of money,
00:08:46 and that’s the only time that expression —“lovers of money”—
00:08:48 is used in the Scriptures.
00:08:51 See, when we see the corrupting influence
00:08:54 that lovers of money have had on business,
00:08:57 government, and false religion,
00:09:00 it teaches us a very powerful lesson.
00:09:05 Money has its proper place in our wallets but not in our hearts.
