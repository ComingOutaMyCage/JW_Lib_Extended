00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:05.025 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Lovers of money”—that didn’t sound too bad.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.362 line:10% position:50% align:center
I mean, compared to “betrayers,” “fierce,”

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.948 line:10% position:50% align:center
“slanderers,” and other traits

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:13.659 line:10% position:50% align:center
listed in 2 Timothy 3,

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.495 line:10% position:50% align:center
what’s so bad about being a lover of money?

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once a person loves money
more than anything or anyone else,

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
it corrupts them.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
let’s consider what lovers of money

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
have done—the effect on big business.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, businesses that produce a good product
at a fair price,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
consumers and others appreciate.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when a business
is run by lovers of money,

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
they cut corners, they lie about risks,

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they accept or offer bribes
or basically do anything they can

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:54.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to raise their stock price
or increase profits.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve all seen the constant upgrades

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:00.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the completely false advertisements.

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:05.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many people today just accept that
as so common and so normal

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:07.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they say, “It’s just business.”

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have lovers of money
affected governments?

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when lovers of money get into power,

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
government for the people
becomes government for them.

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Public money
is diverted into private bank accounts

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
that makes these politicians
and government leaders very wealthy

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the power that love of money has to corrupt

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
even the most well-meaning
men and women in politics.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see it in full effect around us.

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an everyday occurrence.

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
No government on earth
is immune to the effect

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
that lovers of money has on government.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the suffering of many people
around the world

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be traced back to greed

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lovers of money in government.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what effect has lovers of money

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:03.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
had on Christendom and false religion?

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, once Christendom’s priests or ministers

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to charge for their services

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:13.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
or press their congregations very hard
for money,

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
it had a corrupting influence
on the worship of God.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Money changed how religion worked.

00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
It changed the relationship

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
between people and ministers
to their congregation.

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, to illustrate for a moment:
Think of a wife

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
that goes to her husband and hands him a bill

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the work she’s done in the family,

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the husband turns around
and gives her a bill

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the work he’s done in the family.

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that might change
the relationship in the family

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about how they feel
about one another and the work they do?

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course it would.

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah inspired Paul
to see the corrupting influence

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that lovers of money would have on religion

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Timothy 4:3, 4

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:07.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Timothy 4:3, 4.

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “For there will be a period of time

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when they will not put up
with the wholesome teaching,

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but according to their own desires,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they will surround themselves with teachers
to have their ears tickled.

00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:22.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will turn away
from listening to the truth

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:25.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give attention to false stories.”

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, today, as mentioned in these verses,

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
many religions are based
on tickle-their-ears messages,

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
false stories, platitudes,

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind of
feel-good-about-yourself messages.

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:43.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, when I searched on the Internet
about the effect of money on religion,

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:46.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I came across several websites

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
that explain how to form your own religion

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
(what to say and what to do),

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:56.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the whole purpose of getting rich.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:04:01.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
So once a religion is run by lovers of money,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re no longer lovers of truth,
or lovers of God’s Word.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sermons are no longer about Bible truth;

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re more about what people
are willing to pay for.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are even told
that they can buy God’s forgiveness.

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:21.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically,
you can bribe God not to punish you.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
It kind of goes like this: You’ve done bad.

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:27.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
God is going to punish you.

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:29.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So give money to me and the church,

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:32.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
and God will forgive you.

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:35.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, this scam and variations of it

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:37.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a long history.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:41.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indulgences sold by the Catholic Church
back in the 16th century

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
are very good examples of such greed.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:46.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indulgences were basically the church saying

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:49.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can pay for God not to punish you.

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Awake!</i>  of August 1989
explained how Martin Luther 

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt about the Catholic Church 
selling such indulgences.

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:01.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “The selling of indulgences
originated during the Crusades,

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:05.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when they were granted to believers
willing to risk their lives in a ‘holy’ war.

00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:08.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[But] later they were extended to people

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:11.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“offering financial support to the church.

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:15.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Soon, indulgences became
a convenient method of raising money . . . ,

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the bingo of the sixteenth century.’

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:22.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With the sharp tongue for which he
became noted,

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:24.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Martin] Luther asked:

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:28.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If the pope does have the power
to release anyone from purgatory

00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:31.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[basically on the basis
of indulgences of the money],

00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:34.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘why in the name of love

00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:37.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
does he not abolish purgatory
by letting everyone out?’”

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:43.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this really should not surprise us.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
The biggest bribe on record

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the one Satan offered to Jesus.

00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:52.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan said: ‘I will give you [bribe you]

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘all the kingdoms of the world
[basically pay you]

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you fall down and do
an act of worship to me.’

00:05:59.671 --> 00:06:04.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s contrast Satan’s
and Christendom’s view on love of money

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:08.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jesus’ words at Matthew 10:8

00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:13.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 10:8.

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here Jesus was giving some instructions

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:17.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his disciples about the message

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
they should give as they go out
and preach the Kingdom.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he told them:
“Cure the sick, raise up the dead,

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:28.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“make lepers clean, expel demons.

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:31.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
You received free, give free.”

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:33.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why, after stating

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
these beautiful, wonderful things
they could do for people,

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:39.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
would Jesus say something like,
“You received free, give free”?

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jesus knew that the love of money
could corrupt 

00:06:46.093 --> 00:06:50.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
these wonderful miracles
that they could do for others.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:53.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, Jesus had seen how money

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
had corrupted many

00:06:55.602 --> 00:06:58.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the years he had seen mankind.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when he saw—

00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Naaman wanted to give
expensive gifts to Elisha

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he had cured him of his leprosy,

00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:11.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha would not have any of it.

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:14.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Elisha knew that it was wrong

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:18.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to profit from the operation
of God’s holy spirit.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:22.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gehazi, though, couldn’t resist.

00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:24.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
His love of money

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:28.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
totally corrupted his faithful service.

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:33.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, today,
we can’t cure leprosy or raise the dead.

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:36.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the lesson that Jesus gave here

00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:40.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 10:8
is still very applicable to us:

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:43.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You received free, give free.”

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a clear message.

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t accept money
for the work of the holy spirit.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom message and its blessings

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:57.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
are simply not for sale.

00:07:57.164 --> 00:07:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re truly blessed to be part

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s spirit-directed organization,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are lovers of God
rather than lovers of money.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have collections
at our meetings or our conventions.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Donations are made discreetly,

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:16.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and funds are used wisely and modestly.

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we also follow
the Bible’s requirement for elders.

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:22.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1 Timothy chapter 3,

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:27.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that elders should not be
“a lover of money.”

00:08:27.652 --> 00:08:30.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, how important it is that the elders
—those taking the lead—

00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:32.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
should not be a lover of money!

00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:36.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Otherwise, it can corrupt
their relationship with the congregation.

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:38.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, that expression

00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:41.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they should not be “a lover of money”

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:44.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the same expression
that’s used in 2 Timothy 3 

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:46.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how other people
would be lovers of money,

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s the only time that expression
—“lovers of money”—

00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:51.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
is used in the Scriptures.

00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:54.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, when we see the corrupting influence

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:57.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
that lovers of money have had on business,

00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:00.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
government, and false religion,

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:05.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
it teaches us a very powerful lesson.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:10.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Money has its proper place in our wallets
but not in our hearts.
