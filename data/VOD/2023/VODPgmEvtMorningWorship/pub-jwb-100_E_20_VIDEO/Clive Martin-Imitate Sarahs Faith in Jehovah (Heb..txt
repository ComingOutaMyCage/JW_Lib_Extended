00:00:02 We have faith in Jehovah,
00:00:04 and we trust his promises.
00:00:06 And in this, we have a wonderful example
00:00:09 in Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
00:00:12 If you take all the words
00:00:14 that are attributed to Sarah in Genesis,
00:00:16 they amount to about a dozen sentences.
00:00:19 Half of them were about Hagar and Ishmael.
00:00:23 The other half
00:00:25 were about Sarah’s own ability to produce a son for Abraham.
00:00:29 Clearly, this promise
00:00:31 of producing offspring for Abraham was very important.
00:00:35 But how did Sarah feel about it?
00:00:38 We learn something from her own words,
00:00:41 but we get a very strong clue in this verse
00:00:44 in Hebrews chapter 11.
00:00:46 So please turn to Hebrews chapter 11,
00:00:48 and stay there in your Bible.
00:00:52 Here’s our key verse—11:
00:00:55 “By faith also Sarah received power to conceive offspring,
00:01:00 “even when she was past the age,
00:01:02 since she considered Him faithful who made the promise.”
00:01:06 “She considered Him faithful
00:01:10 who made the promise.”
00:01:13 Now, that kind of faith doesn’t develop overnight.
00:01:17 So let’s look at about 25 years of Sarah’s life
00:01:21 and see how she retained faith in Jehovah’s promises
00:01:25 despite hardship, disappointment, and uncertainty.
00:01:30 Hardship:
00:01:33 Sarah is about 65 years old,
00:01:35 and she accompanies her husband, Abraham, across the Euphrates River
00:01:40 south toward the land of Canaan.
00:01:43 It was a long, arduous journey.
00:01:47 But they were powered by Jehovah’s promise.
00:01:50 ‘I’m going to make a great nation out of you.’
00:01:53 That didn’t mean it was easy.
00:01:55 They were still getting used to this new country,
00:01:58 finding their way around when the land was gripped by famine.
00:02:03 They had to make another long journey all the way down to Egypt.
00:02:07 It gets worse.
00:02:09 Sarah is kidnapped as a potential wife for Pharaoh.
00:02:13 Has the God of promise abandoned them?
00:02:16 By no means.
00:02:18 Jehovah miraculously saved Sarah from the situation.
00:02:22 They get back safely to the land of Canaan,
00:02:26 and as a family, they start to prosper.
00:02:29 What does Sarah learn from this about Jehovah’s promises?
00:02:34 Don’t focus on the hardship
00:02:37 but on how Jehovah carries you through it.
00:02:42 Disappointment:
00:02:45 You imagine the excitement of Abraham when one night
00:02:49 he comes and shares with Sarah what Jehovah has just told him:
00:02:54 ‘Look up at the stars of heaven; can you count them?’
00:02:57 “So your offspring will become.”
00:03:00 And Jehovah also said to Abraham:
00:03:03 ‘Your offspring will be afflicted and enslaved for 400 years
00:03:07 before they come back and take possession of the land.’
00:03:11 Now, if you’re Sarah,
00:03:14 how do you respond?
00:03:17 ‘Four hundred years!
00:03:20 ‘We’ve been here, what, ten years,
00:03:23 ‘and still 400 years!
00:03:25 We won’t even see this in our lifetime!’
00:03:29 So how did Sarah really respond
00:03:32 when she learned the full extent
00:03:34 of Jehovah’s larger promise?
00:03:37 Go back to Hebrews chapter 11.
00:03:42 Verses 11 and 12 talked about Sarah’s faith, and then verse 13 says:
00:03:47 “In faith all of these [including Sarah] died,
00:03:51 “although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises
00:03:55 “(not in their lifetime);
00:03:57 “but they saw them from a distance
00:04:00 and welcomed them.”
00:04:03 Because of Sarah’s faith in Jehovah’s promises,
00:04:06 she was willing to be patient to follow Jehovah’s timetable.
00:04:11 But this probably wasn’t her biggest disappointment.
00:04:15 Jehovah had just said again:
00:04:18 ‘I’m going to make Abraham’s offspring
00:04:20 like the stars of heaven.’
00:04:22 And Sarah really wanted that privilege
00:04:26 of producing a son for Abraham to be hers.
00:04:30 But now, at the age of 75,
00:04:32 it seemed that her chances of having that privilege
00:04:34 were just slipping away.
00:04:37 What would she do?
00:04:39 Well, she realized here, too, the promise was bigger than her.
00:04:44 And so she took Hagar her maidservant
00:04:48 and gave her to Abraham so that she could give a son to him.
00:04:55 She had faith in Jehovah’s promise,
00:04:58 and despite her personal disappointments,
00:05:00 she wanted to do everything she could to support it.
00:05:06 Close on the heels of disappointment was uncertainty.
00:05:11 Do you think as Sarah
00:05:14 watched young Ishmael,
00:05:17 Hagar’s son, grow up
00:05:19 that she wondered about her own role,
00:05:22 her own real value?
00:05:24 The next time we meet up with Sarah,
00:05:28 Ishmael is about 13 years of age
00:05:30 and Sarah is 89.
00:05:33 She and Abraham are entertaining
00:05:35 three angelic messengers from Jehovah,
00:05:39 and as she listens to the conversation,
00:05:42 she realizes that this time the message is not just for Abraham;
00:05:46 it’s for her.
00:05:48 This time next year, Sarah will have a son.
00:05:53 As she listens, she can’t help herself.
00:05:55 She laughs, and then she denies laughing.
00:05:57 So her laughter—  Was this a lack of faith
00:06:01 or disbelief in Jehovah’s promise?
00:06:04 No.
00:06:05 Go back to our key verse, because this is exactly where it comes in—verse 11:
00:06:10 “By faith also Sarah received power to conceive offspring, . . .
00:06:15 “since she considered Him faithful
00:06:18 who made the promise.”
00:06:21 She always had that faith.
00:06:24 Now, imagine Sarah’s joy.
00:06:27 She is raising a young son
00:06:29 with a beautiful, spiritual disposition.
00:06:34 This is exactly the one (the right disposition)
00:06:37 to carry on Jehovah’s great promise.
00:06:40 This is her son.
00:06:44 Sarah didn’t live long enough to see Isaac marry Rebekah
00:06:49 or to see his twin boys,
00:06:52 but when she wakes up in the Paradise,
00:06:54 she’ll be able to find out all of that and she will learn
00:06:58 the remarkable role that Jehovah
00:07:00 always had in mind for her and his purpose.
00:07:04 But going back, how did Sarah cope
00:07:08 with those years of uncertainty?
00:07:11 Let’s go back to Hebrews 11, because we’ve described
00:07:15 Sarah as a woman of faith in Jehovah’s promises.
00:07:19 Now, a few verses earlier in verse 6,
00:07:22 this is an important aspect of faith.
00:07:26 Paul says: “Moreover, without faith
00:07:29 “it is impossible to please God well,
00:07:31 “for whoever approaches God must believe [must believe]
00:07:36 “that he is and that he becomes
00:07:39 the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”
00:07:44 Now, Sarah didn’t always know
00:07:46 how Jehovah would reward her or when,
00:07:49 but she did have this kind of faith.
00:07:52 And so she believed
00:07:54 in Jehovah as the Rewarder and the Fulfiller of promises.
00:08:00 So, what have we learned from Sarah when it comes to Jehovah’s promises?
00:08:06 We’ll have hardship, but that’s not where we focus.
00:08:09 We focus on how Jehovah is helping us.
00:08:12 If we experience personal disappointment,
00:08:15 we realize Jehovah’s promise is bigger than us.
00:08:18 We patiently wait on Jehovah,
00:08:20 and we humbly do what we can to support his great work.
00:08:25 We’ll face uncertainty,
00:08:27 but in all things, we trust our Rewarder and his promises.
00:08:33 Every day, we rely on the fact
00:08:36 that Jehovah has made promises
00:08:38 and he fulfills them on our behalf.
00:08:41 Jehovah never lets us down.
00:08:44 And the best is yet to come.
00:08:46 We know this because, like Sarah,
00:08:49 ‘we consider him faithful who made the promise.’
