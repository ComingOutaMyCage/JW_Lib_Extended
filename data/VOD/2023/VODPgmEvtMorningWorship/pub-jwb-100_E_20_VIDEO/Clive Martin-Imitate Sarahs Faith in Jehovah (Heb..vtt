WEBVTT

00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:04.454 line:10% position:50% align:center
We have faith in Jehovah,

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:06.756 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we trust his promises.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:09.426 line:10% position:50% align:center
And in this, we have a wonderful example

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:12.829 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Sarah, Abraham’s wife.

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.497 line:10% position:50% align:center
If you take all the words

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:16.866 line:10% position:50% align:center
that are attributed to Sarah in Genesis,

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
they amount to about a dozen sentences.

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:23.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Half of them were about Hagar and Ishmael.

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
The other half

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:29.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
were about Sarah’s own ability
to produce a son for Abraham.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, this promise

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:35.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
of producing offspring for Abraham
was very important.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did Sarah feel about it?

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:41.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learn something from her own words,

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we get a very strong clue in this verse

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:46.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please turn to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay there in your Bible.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s our key verse—11:

00:00:55.238 --> 00:01:00.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By faith also Sarah
received power to conceive offspring,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even when she was past the age,

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:06.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
since she considered Him faithful
who made the promise.”

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She considered Him faithful

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made the promise.”

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that kind of faith
doesn’t develop overnight.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s look at about 25 years
of Sarah’s life

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:25.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how she retained faith
in Jehovah’s promises

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:29.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite hardship,
disappointment, and uncertainty.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hardship:

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah is about 65 years old,

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:40.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she accompanies her husband, Abraham,
across the Euphrates River

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
south toward the land of Canaan.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a long, arduous journey.

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:50.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they were powered by Jehovah’s promise.

00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:52.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to make
a great nation out of you.’

00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
That didn’t mean it was easy.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were still getting used
to this new country,

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
finding their way around
when the land was gripped by famine.

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to make another long journey
all the way down to Egypt.

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gets worse.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:13.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah is kidnapped
as a potential wife for Pharaoh.

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has the God of promise abandoned them?

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:18.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
By no means.

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:22.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah miraculously saved Sarah
from the situation.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
They get back safely to the land of Canaan,

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a family, they start to prosper.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Sarah learn from this
about Jehovah’s promises?

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t focus on the hardship

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:39.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on how Jehovah carries you through it.

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:43.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Disappointment: 

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:49.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
You imagine the excitement of Abraham
when one night 

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:53.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
he comes and shares with Sarah
what Jehovah has just told him:

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Look up at the stars of heaven;
can you count them?’

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So your offspring will become.”

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah also said to Abraham:

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Your offspring will be
afflicted and enslaved for 400 years

00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:11.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
before they come back
and take possession of the land.’

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you’re Sarah,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:17.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you respond?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Four hundred years!

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:23.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We’ve been here, what, ten years,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and still 400 years!

00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t even see this in our lifetime!’

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:32.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Sarah really respond

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she learned the full extent

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s larger promise?

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go back to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:47.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 11 and 12 talked about Sarah’s faith,
and then verse 13 says:

00:03:47.343 --> 00:03:51.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In faith all of these
[including Sarah] died,

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“although they did not receive
the fulfillment of the promises

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(not in their lifetime);

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they saw them from a distance

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and welcomed them.”

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Sarah’s faith
in Jehovah’s promises,

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:09.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was willing to be patient
to follow Jehovah’s timetable.

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this probably wasn’t
her biggest disappointment.

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had just said again:

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to make Abraham’s offspring

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the stars of heaven.’

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:26.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Sarah really wanted that privilege

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
of producing a son for Abraham to be hers.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, at the age of 75,

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:34.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seemed that her chances
of having that privilege

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
were just slipping away.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:39.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would she do?

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she realized here, too,
the promise was bigger than her.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:48.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so she took Hagar her maidservant

00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:53.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave her to Abraham
so that she could give a son to him.

00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:58.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had faith in Jehovah’s promise,

00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and despite her personal disappointments,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
she wanted to do everything she could
to support it.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:11.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Close on the heels of disappointment
was uncertainty.

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:14.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think as Sarah

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
watched young Ishmael,

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hagar’s son, grow up

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she wondered about her own role,

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
her own real value?

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:28.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next time we meet up with Sarah,

00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ishmael is about 13 years of age

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sarah is 89.

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
She and Abraham are entertaining

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
three angelic messengers from Jehovah,

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:42.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as she listens to the conversation,

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
she realizes that this time the message
is not just for Abraham;

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s for her.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time next year, Sarah will have a son.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she listens, she can’t help herself.

00:05:55.038 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
She laughs, and then she denies laughing.

00:05:57.874 --> 00:06:01.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
So her laughter— 
Was this a lack of faith

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
or disbelief in Jehovah’s promise?

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:05.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:10.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go back to our key verse, because this is
exactly where it comes in—verse 11:

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By faith also Sarah received power
to conceive offspring, . . .

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“since she considered Him faithful

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made the promise.”

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always had that faith.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, imagine Sarah’s joy.

00:06:27.503 --> 00:06:29.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is raising a young son

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a beautiful, spiritual disposition.

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:37.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is exactly the one
(the right disposition)

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry on Jehovah’s great promise.

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:42.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is her son.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah didn’t live long enough to see
Isaac marry Rebekah

00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to see his twin boys,

00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:54.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when she wakes up in the Paradise,

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:58.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’ll be able to find out all of that
and she will learn

00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:00.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
the remarkable role that Jehovah

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
always had in mind for her and his purpose.

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
But going back, how did Sarah cope

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:11.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those years of uncertainty?

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to Hebrews 11,
because we’ve described

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:19.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah as a woman of faith
in Jehovah’s promises.

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:22.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a few verses earlier in verse 6,

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:26.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is an important aspect of faith.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Moreover, without faith

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:31.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:36.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for whoever approaches God
must believe [must believe]

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that he is and that he becomes

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:42.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:46.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Sarah didn’t always know

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:49.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah would reward her or when,

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she did have this kind of faith.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so she believed

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah as the Rewarder
and the Fulfiller of promises.

00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned from Sarah
when it comes to Jehovah’s promises?

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:09.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll have hardship,
but that’s not where we focus.

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
We focus on how Jehovah is helping us.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we experience personal disappointment,

00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realize Jehovah’s promise
is bigger than us.

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:20.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
We patiently wait on Jehovah,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we humbly do what we can
to support his great work.

We’ll face uncertainty,

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in all things,
we trust our Rewarder and his promises.

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:36.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day, we rely on the fact

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has made promises

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he fulfills them on our behalf.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:43.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never lets us down.

00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the best is yet to come.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:49.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know this because, like Sarah,

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we consider him faithful
who made the promise.’
