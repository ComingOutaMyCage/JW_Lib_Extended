00:00:01 As our commenters bring out,
00:00:03 our focus today is on something
00:00:05 that is actually very private
00:00:08 and perhaps very sensitive,
00:00:10 and that is our motives.
00:00:13 Motives dwell deep within our figurative hearts.
00:00:18 They really are described as “the impelling force behind our conduct”
00:00:23 and decision-making.
00:00:25 But today, our text puts us on alert about these motives,
00:00:30 and we need to have Jehovah’s viewpoint of them.
00:00:35 Let’s consider the full scripture.
00:00:37 Open your Bibles, please, to Proverbs 16:2.
00:00:44 We’re alerted to this because, as we’ve already discussed,
00:00:47 motives are an impelling force.
00:00:50 They can help us do what is right in God’s eyes,
00:00:53 but they also can deceive us into doing what is wrong.
00:00:57 Notice what the Bible says about this;
00:00:59 Proverbs 16:2 says:
00:01:02 “All of man’s ways seem right to him,
00:01:06 but Jehovah examines the motives.”
00:01:10 Interesting.
00:01:11 We could set a very good goal for ourselves
00:01:14 —be involved in what appears to be very good things.
00:01:18 But if, as the Bible says,
00:01:21 our ways or our thoughts may appear good
00:01:24 but Jehovah examines them
00:01:26 and he sees that our motives are not pure,
00:01:30 or not in total harmony with his will,
00:01:32 well, we could meet up with his disapproval
00:01:37 and even sharp judgment.
00:01:40 How, then, can we make sure that our motives are pure
00:01:44 and that they are pleasing to Jehovah God?
00:01:48 In order to understand that, we have to understand our hearts
00:01:51 because this is where our motives reside —in our figurative hearts.
00:01:55 An important aspect of our hearts
00:01:57 is brought out for us in Jeremiah 17:9.
00:02:01 Remember, it says there that “the heart is more treacherous
00:02:04 “than anything else and is desperate.
00:02:06 Who can know it?”
00:02:09 You see, our imperfect figurative hearts are inherently selfish.
00:02:13 It thinks of only one thing, and that is itself.
00:02:17 And our hearts could deceive us into justifying errors on our part
00:02:21 or even justifying self-seeking actions,
00:02:25 using Jehovah’s service
00:02:28 for our own personal benefit.
00:02:32 Now, this is a dangerous thing.
00:02:34 A case in point is brought out for us.
00:02:36 If you look at the cross-reference to this scripture
00:02:39 at 1 Samuel 15:13, 14—
00:02:43 In fact, let’s open our Bibles to that portion of the scripture.
00:02:46 It’s the account of King Saul,
00:02:49 and Jehovah God gave King Saul very definite directions
00:02:54 on what he wanted him to do,
00:02:56 and that was to completely annihilate the Amalekites
00:02:59 from the greatest to the least of them.
00:03:01 He was to get rid of them.
00:03:03 Now, if we look at verses 5 through 7,
00:03:05 we see that Saul took on this assignment, and he was doing rather well.
00:03:10 He was doing exactly what Jehovah had told him to do,
00:03:13 and that was to annihilate the Amalekites.
00:03:15 But in verse 9, we see that something went wrong
00:03:19 —something changed.
00:03:21 In verse 9, it says: “However, Saul and the people
00:03:24 “spared Agag [who was the king] and the best of the flock, the herd,
00:03:28 “the fattened animals, the rams, and all that was good.
00:03:32 “They did not want to devote them to destruction.
00:03:35 “But all the goods that were worthless and unwanted,
00:03:38 these they devoted to destruction.”
00:03:41 So we see something happened here.
00:03:44 Saul developed, or had, his motives for one point only:
00:03:49 using Jehovah’s service —this commission—
00:03:52 to do what?
00:03:53 To glorify himself, to benefit himself.
00:03:57 In fact, if you look in verse 12, he even went so far as to go to Carmel
00:04:00 and erect a monument to himself
00:04:04 —glorifying this great victory that he performed over the Amalekites
00:04:09 and bringing King Agag back with him (as perhaps a trophy)
00:04:13 to show everyone that he dominated this nation, got rid of them,
00:04:17 and enriched himself by these beautiful animals
00:04:21 that would no doubt benefit the herds that they had.
00:04:25 Well,
00:04:27 was Jehovah fooled by this?
00:04:29 Obviously not. Jehovah saw right through it.
00:04:31 He saw right to the core of the matter that Saul’s motives were not pure.
00:04:36 And so when he sent Samuel to the camp,
00:04:39 he told Samuel to tell Saul he had basically been condemned,
00:04:43 ripping the rulership away from him.
00:04:45 He was no longer pleasing to Jehovah God.
00:04:49 Saul, though, before he heard this denunciation from Jehovah,
00:04:53 thought he was still in good stead with God,
00:04:55 and he was putting on a big show
00:04:57 of being a servant of God, a faithful man.
00:05:00 He said in verse 13:
00:05:02 “May Jehovah bless you [when he saw Samuel].
00:05:05 I have carried out the word of Jehovah.”
00:05:10 And Samuel set him straight:
00:05:12 ‘No you didn’t. You were lying.
00:05:16 You were seeking your own glory and not Jehovah’s glory.’
00:05:21 Well, what can we learn from this account?
00:05:23 It’s a very good account to have in mind
00:05:26 because it’s a sharp contrast, or an acute example,
00:05:30 of what we’re discussing here today about motives.
00:05:34 We see that Saul’s motives were not pure.
00:05:38 He was not putting Jehovah first in his life,
00:05:41 and, in fact, his impure motives
00:05:44 moved him to an unfaithful course with God,
00:05:48 meeting up with his strong judgment against him.
00:05:52 How can we avoid making such a terrible mistake
00:05:56 in succumbing to perhaps impure reasonings or motives
00:06:00 that we might have in our hearts?
00:06:02 How can ‘we even know it’ —as the Bible says—
00:06:04 that it’s there?
00:06:06 Well, Jehovah does help us read our motives
00:06:09 and understand what’s going on.
00:06:12 At Hebrews 4:12,
00:06:14 we can see that Jehovah has given us a marvelous tool to do that.
00:06:20 It says: “For the word of God is alive
00:06:22 “and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword
00:06:26 “and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit,
00:06:29 “and of joints from the marrow,
00:06:31 and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.”
00:06:37 So it’s no wonder that we are given strong admonition from the faithful slave
00:06:42 to read God’s Word, the Bible, every day.
00:06:45 It’s by means of this amazing tool
00:06:49 that can pierce through and slice through the hard shell
00:06:54 of our figurative, imperfect hearts
00:06:57 that it is revealed what’s really there.
00:07:00 And then we can do something about it.
00:07:03 You see, as we learned in this past week’s Watchtower—
00:07:06 What a wonderful article it was!
00:07:08 And what beautiful guidance it gave us
00:07:11 about how to gain strength from God’s Word
00:07:13 and also how to accomplish
00:07:15 this very difficult assignment, if you will,
00:07:19 of knowing what’s in our hearts!
00:07:21 Here we are told that before we read God’s Word,
00:07:24 we should pray, ask Jehovah’s spirit to guide and direct us,
00:07:28 and then after reading it, imagine that we are there
00:07:31 in the very account that we’re reading
00:07:34 —in the shoes of the ones that we’re talking about.
00:07:36 Meditate on these things.
00:07:39 Understand what is truly going on in our hearts.
00:07:43 How does this information apply to me personally?
00:07:45 And then apply what we learn.
00:07:49 And you see, by doing that, well, then we can not only reveal
00:07:53 what’s going on inside of our hearts
00:07:55 but then we can take steps to correct our motives
00:07:58 if they need correcting.
00:08:01 Perhaps as young brothers,
00:08:04 we desire to reach out for service as a privilege in the congregation.
00:08:08 It’s a wonderful thing to reach out to be a ministerial servant, to be an elder.
00:08:12 But what are the true motives?
00:08:15 Why do we want this assignment?
00:08:18 Well, this is where following
00:08:20 this four-step procedure that we learned can help.
00:08:23 Why not read all the qualifications
00:08:25 that a ministerial servant or an elder should have?
00:08:27 Meditate upon them.
00:08:29 Apply these things in our life and ask ourselves:
00:08:32 ‘Why do I really want to be a servant in the congregation?
00:08:37 ‘Is it to glorify myself, to promote myself,
00:08:40 or to actually do the work?’
00:08:43 Imagine ourselves being Timothy or Paul
00:08:47 or other faithful men mentioned in the Bible
00:08:49 who expended themselves and poured themselves out
00:08:51 on behalf of God’s people in doing Jehovah’s will,
00:08:55 even perhaps being looked down upon
00:08:57 both by those in the congregation as well as on the outside.
00:09:01 Are we willing to do that?
00:09:04 Actually, all of us who desire theocratic assignments
00:09:07 should go through this kind of procedure
00:09:09 to make sure that our hearts
00:09:11 —our motives, really—
00:09:14 are in harmony with Jehovah’s will
00:09:16 for this assignment as well as what he wants for us.
00:09:22 Doing this, perhaps maybe we find
00:09:24 that we may be harboring a Saul-like motive
00:09:28 and perhaps want to use Jehovah’s service
00:09:30 for self-interests and to promote ourselves.
00:09:35 I think it was interesting several years ago back in 2016
00:09:39 at the “Remain Loyal to Jehovah” convention
00:09:42 —perhaps you recall the the symposium “Avoid What Erodes Loyalty”—
00:09:46 and there it gave the experience of an elder who was taking the lead,
00:09:49 how he was revealed.
00:09:51 His motives were revealed by some counsel that an elder had given him,
00:09:55 and he saw that he wasn’t responding correctly.
00:09:59 So, what did he do?
00:10:01 He prayed to Jehovah,
00:10:03 and then he took on assignments in the congregation that no one ever saw,
00:10:07 working after hours, perhaps when no one was at the Kingdom Hall,
00:10:11 doing things that would not put him in the limelight.
00:10:14 Yet, it was necessary work
00:10:16 —work that needed to be done to carry out God’s will and purpose.
00:10:20 This eventually changed his heart.
00:10:23 And as we understand from that video
00:10:26 and that brother in the basement taking the lead with the brothers there,
00:10:29 it actually saved his life to make these changes and helped.
00:10:33 And Jehovah used him to appropriately shepherd the flock
00:10:37 during the great tribulation.
00:10:39 Well, that’s a good example for us.
00:10:42 That’s what we want to do, and we can.
