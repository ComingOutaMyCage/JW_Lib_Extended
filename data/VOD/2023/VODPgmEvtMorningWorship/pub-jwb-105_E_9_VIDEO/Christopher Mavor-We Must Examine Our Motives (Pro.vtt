00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:03.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our commenters bring out,

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:05.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
our focus today is on something

00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:08.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
that is actually very private

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.323 line:10% position:50% align:center
and perhaps very sensitive,

00:00:10.323 --> 00:00:13.660 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that is our motives.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.415 line:10% position:50% align:center
Motives dwell deep within our figurative hearts.

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:23.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really are described
as “the impelling force behind our conduct”

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decision-making.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
But today, our text puts us on alert
about these motives,

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:35.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we need to have
Jehovah’s viewpoint of them.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the full scripture.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles, please, to Proverbs 16:2.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re alerted to this
because, as we’ve already discussed,

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:50.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
motives are an impelling force.

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:53.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can help us
do what is right in God’s eyes,

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:57.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they also can deceive us
into doing what is wrong.

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the Bible says about this;

00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:02.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 16:2 says:

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of man’s ways seem right to him,

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:09.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah examines the motives.”

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:11.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could set a very good goal for ourselves

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:18.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
—be involved in what appears
to be very good things.

00:01:18.313 --> 00:01:21.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if, as the Bible says,

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
our ways or our thoughts may appear good

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah examines them

00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:30.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he sees that our motives are not pure,

00:01:30.743 --> 00:01:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
or not in total harmony with his will,

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:37.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, we could meet up with his disapproval

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even sharp judgment.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:44.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
How, then,
can we make sure that our motives are pure

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they are pleasing to Jehovah God?

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:51.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to understand that,
we have to understand our hearts

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:55.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this is where our motives reside
—in our figurative hearts.

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:57.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
An important aspect of our hearts

00:01:57.646 --> 00:02:01.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
is brought out for us in Jeremiah 17:9.

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, it says there
that “the heart is more treacherous

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:06.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“than anything else and is desperate.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who can know it?”

00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:13.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, our imperfect figurative hearts
are inherently selfish.

00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:16.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
It thinks of only one thing,
and that is itself.

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:21.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our hearts could deceive us
into justifying errors on our part

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even justifying self-seeking actions,

00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:28.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
using Jehovah’s service

00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:32.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our own personal benefit.

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is a dangerous thing.

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:36.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
A case in point is brought out for us.

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look at the cross-reference
to this scripture

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:43.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Samuel 15:13, 14—

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:46.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, let’s open our Bibles
to that portion of the scripture.

00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:49.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the account of King Saul,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah God
gave King Saul very definite directions

00:02:54.165 --> 00:02:56.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what he wanted him to do,

00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:59.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was
to completely annihilate the Amalekites

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the greatest to the least of them.

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:03.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was to get rid of them.

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we look at verses 5 through 7,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that Saul took on this assignment,
and he was doing rather well.

00:03:10.474 --> 00:03:13.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was doing exactly
what Jehovah had told him to do,

00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:15.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was to annihilate the Amalekites.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:19.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in verse 9,
we see that something went wrong

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:21.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
—something changed.

00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:24.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 9, it says:
“However, Saul and the people

00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:28.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“spared Agag [who was the king]
and the best of the flock, the herd,

00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:32.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the fattened animals, the rams,
and all that was good.

00:03:32.123 --> 00:03:35.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not want
to devote them to destruction.

00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:38.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But all the goods
that were worthless and unwanted,

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:40.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
these they devoted to destruction.”

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see something happened here.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul developed, or had,
his motives for one point only:

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:52.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
using Jehovah’s service
—this commission—

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do what?

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
To glorify himself, to benefit himself.

00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:00.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, if you look in verse 12,
he even went so far as to go to Carmel

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and erect a monument to himself

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
—glorifying this great victory
that he performed over the Amalekites

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:13.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bringing King Agag back with him
(as perhaps a trophy)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show everyone
that he dominated this nation, got rid of them,

00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enriched himself
by these beautiful animals

00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:25.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would no doubt benefit
the herds that they had.

00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:27.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
was Jehovah fooled by this?

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:31.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously not.
Jehovah saw right through it.

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:36.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw right to the core of the matter
that Saul’s motives were not pure.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so when he sent Samuel to the camp,

00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:43.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told Samuel to tell Saul
he had basically been condemned,

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
ripping the rulership away from him.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was no longer pleasing to Jehovah God.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul, though, before he heard
this denunciation from Jehovah,

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
thought he was still in good stead with God,

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was putting on a big show

00:04:57.256 --> 00:05:00.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being a servant of God, a faithful man.

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:02.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said in verse 13:

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:05.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah bless you [when he saw Samuel].

00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:08.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have carried out the word of Jehovah.”

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Samuel set him straight:

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘No you didn’t.
You were lying.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were seeking your own glory
and not Jehovah’s glory.’

00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:23.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what can we learn from this account?

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a very good account to have in mind

00:05:26.203 --> 00:05:30.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’s a sharp contrast,
or an acute example,

00:05:30.082 --> 00:05:34.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what we’re discussing here today
about motives.

00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:38.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see that Saul’s motives were not pure.

00:05:38.383 --> 00:05:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was not putting Jehovah first in his life,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in fact, his impure motives

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:48.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved him to an unfaithful course with God,

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:51.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
meeting up with his strong judgment
against him.

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:56.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we avoid
making such a terrible mistake

00:05:56.944 --> 00:06:00.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
in succumbing
to perhaps impure reasonings or motives

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we might have in our hearts?

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:04.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can ‘we even know it’
—as the Bible says—

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:06.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s there?

00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:09.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah does help us read our motives

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:12.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and understand what’s going on.

00:06:12.044 --> 00:06:14.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 4:12,

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see that Jehovah has given us
a marvelous tool to do that.

00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:22.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“For the word of God is alive

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:26.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and exerts power
and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:29.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and pierces even to the dividing
of soul and spirit,

00:06:29.938 --> 00:06:31.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of joints from the marrow,

00:06:31.732 --> 00:06:36.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is able to discern
thoughts and intentions of the heart.”

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:42.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s no wonder that we are given
strong admonition from the faithful slave

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:45.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read God’s Word, the Bible, every day.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:49.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s by means of this amazing tool

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:54.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can pierce through
and slice through the hard shell

00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:57.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our figurative, imperfect hearts

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:00.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it is revealed what’s really there.

00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:03.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we can do something about it.

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:06.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, as we learned
in this past week’s <i>Watchtower— </i>

00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:08.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a wonderful article it was!

00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:11.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what beautiful guidance it gave us

00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:13.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to gain strength from God’s Word

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:15.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also how to accomplish

00:07:15.654 --> 00:07:19.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
this very difficult assignment, if you will,

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
of knowing what’s in our hearts!

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:24.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we are told
that before we read God’s Word,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should pray, ask Jehovah’s spirit
to guide and direct us,

00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:31.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then after reading it,
imagine that we are there

00:07:31.713 --> 00:07:34.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the very account that we’re reading

00:07:34.215 --> 00:07:36.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in the shoes of the ones
that we’re talking about.

00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:39.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on these things.

00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:43.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understand what is truly going on
in our hearts.

00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:45.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this information apply
to me personally?

00:07:45.686 --> 00:07:48.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then apply what we learn.

00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you see, by doing that,
well, then we can not only reveal

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:55.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s going on inside of our hearts

00:07:55.613 --> 00:07:58.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then we can take steps
to correct our motives

00:07:58.742 --> 00:08:00.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they need correcting.

00:08:01.703 --> 00:08:04.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps as young brothers,

00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:08.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
we desire to reach out for service
as a privilege in the congregation.

00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:12.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a wonderful thing to reach out
to be a ministerial servant, to be an elder.

00:08:12.882 --> 00:08:15.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are the true motives?

00:08:15.927 --> 00:08:18.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we want this assignment?

00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:20.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this is where following

00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
this four-step procedure that we learned
can help.

00:08:23.143 --> 00:08:25.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not read all the qualifications

00:08:25.228 --> 00:08:27.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a ministerial servant
or an elder should have?

00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:29.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate upon them.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apply these things in our life
and ask ourselves:

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why do I really want
to be a servant in the congregation?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is it to glorify myself, to promote myself,

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:43.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to actually do the work?’

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:47.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine ourselves being Timothy or Paul

00:08:47.002 --> 00:08:49.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other faithful men mentioned in the Bible

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
who expended themselves
and poured themselves out

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
on behalf of God’s people
in doing Jehovah’s will,

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
even perhaps being looked down upon

00:08:57.972 --> 00:09:01.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
both by those in the congregation
as well as on the outside.

00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:03.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we willing to do that?

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually,
all of us who desire theocratic assignments

00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:09.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
should go through this kind of procedure

00:09:09.484 --> 00:09:11.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that our hearts

00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:14.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our motives, really—

00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:16.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in harmony with Jehovah’s will

00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:20.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this assignment
as well as what he wants for us.

00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing this, perhaps maybe we find

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:28.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may be harboring a Saul-like motive

00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:30.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps want to use Jehovah’s service

00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:34.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
for self-interests and to promote ourselves.

00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:39.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it was interesting
several years ago back in 2016

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:42.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the “Remain Loyal to Jehovah” convention

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:46.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps you recall the the symposium
“Avoid What Erodes Loyalty”—

00:09:46.274 --> 00:09:49.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there it gave the experience
of an elder who was taking the lead,

00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:51.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he was revealed.

00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:55.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
His motives were revealed
by some counsel that an elder had given him,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he saw
that he wasn’t responding correctly.

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:01.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did he do?

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
He prayed to Jehovah,

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:07.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he took on assignments
in the congregation that no one ever saw,

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:11.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
working after hours, perhaps when no one
was at the Kingdom Hall,

00:10:11.342 --> 00:10:14.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing things
that would not put him in the limelight.

00:10:14.429 --> 00:10:16.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, it was necessary work

00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:20.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
—work that needed to be done
to carry out God’s will and purpose.

00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:22.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
This eventually changed his heart.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we understand from that video

00:10:26.108 --> 00:10:29.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that brother in the basement
taking the lead with the brothers there,

00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:33.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
it actually saved his life
to make these changes and helped.

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah used him
to appropriately shepherd the flock

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the great tribulation.

00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:42.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a good example for us.

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:45.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we want to do, and we can.
