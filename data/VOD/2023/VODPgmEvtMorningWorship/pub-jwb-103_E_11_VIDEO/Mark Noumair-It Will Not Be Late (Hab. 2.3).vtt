WEBVTT

00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know anything
about Habakkuk’s parents.

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know anything

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:07.152 line:10% position:50% align:center
about his circumstances in life or his death.

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:08.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
We don’t know anything about Habakkuk,

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.448 line:10% position:50% align:center
but what we do know is that he lived

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
during a most stressful time

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.495 line:10% position:50% align:center
during the nation of Israel’s history.

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
The year was 628 B.C.E.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wicked King Jehoiakim was ruling,
the son of Josiah.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:28.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be about 20 years
before 607 B.C.E.

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 2 describes the conditions

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Habakkuk and Jeremiah
and others had to face.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 2 says:

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How long, O Jehovah,
must I cry for help, but you do not hear?

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long must I ask for help from violence,
but you do not intervene?”

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
How stressful
this must have been to Habakkuk!

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was no city of peace,
rather, a city of violence and bloodshed.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 4 says:

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wicked surround the righteous.”

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:02.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophet Urijah had to run away
because of the wickedness; he was afraid.

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went down to Egypt.

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoiakim drags him
back to Jerusalem and kills him.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jehoiakim hated Jeremiah,

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
had seething hatred for that prophet.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a scary time to live in Jerusalem,
and Habakkuk had to do that.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder—no wonder he poured out
his heart to Jehovah:

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:24.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why, Jehovah—why?
Why don’t you do something?

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jerusalem—this is the city you chose;

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘your temple is here;
you had this temple built;

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘the Davidic king is on the throne.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This is your city, Jehovah.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you do something?’

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah said,
‘Habakkuk, I am doing something

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I am doing something.’

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And He now goes on
to show what He is doing.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is wicked times there.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But He shows now in verses 5 and 6

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
(even as Brother Thomas had said)

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Babylonians are coming
—the Chaldeans are coming—

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re going to punish
unfaithful Israelites, unfaithful ones.

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:04.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in chapter 2,
Jehovah shows Habakkuk

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Babylon itself
will not escape punishment

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that it will be conquered
by the Medes and the Persians

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 539 B.C.E.

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
So amid all of those problems,

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Habakkuk, I have my eye on you
[Jehovah is saying]

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and on Jeremiah and Daniel and Ezekiel.

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘These faithful ones
—they’re not going to be lost in the crowd.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:26.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ll take care of you.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:30.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in the meantime,
be faithful and be patient.’

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now in chapter 1

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in fact, in chapter 2, verse 3—

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:40.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah shows and He explains to Habakkuk

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
exactly what He is doing as well

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
(chapter 2 and verse 3).

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The vision is yet for its appointed time,

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:54.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it is rushing toward its end,
and it will not lie.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:56.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if it should delay, . . . ”

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You see, the vision
—the destruction of Jerusalem—

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘it is rushing toward its end.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s eagerly moving forward
toward its fulfillment, Habakkuk.

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:07.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if it should delay, you be careful.’

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the imperfect mind, it might delay.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Habakkuk and others thought:

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, didn’t Isaiah say that Babylon
was going to destroy Jerusalem?

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was 100 years ago.’

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:19.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hadn’t happened yet.

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it might delay in one’s mind.

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, what does Jehovah say
there in verse 3?

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last sentence: “It will not be late!”

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:33.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Habakkuk, it will not be late!’

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 20 years (20 years later),

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 607 B.C.E., Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
So any delay
was a perceived delay due to imperfection.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
607 B.C.E.—oh, it’s easy for us.

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look back in history—

00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:53.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look back,
and we say from our standpoint:

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“607 B.C.E., of course it was 607 B.C.E.

00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:59.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That was a crucial date in Bible prophecy.

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:03.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“607 B.C.E. is linked
to the birth of God’s Kingdom in 1914.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
607 B.C.E.
is the beginning of the Gentile Times.”

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get it!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Habakkuk, Jeremiah, and others

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not have the luxury
of looking back retrospectively and saying,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s going to be in 607 B.C.E.”

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah just said to them:

00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not be late!”

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Your job, your work
—be faithful and be patient.

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am doing something.’

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he’s telling Habakkuk.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same with us today.

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Armageddon—it’s fixed; it’s predetermined.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hour, the day—it’s coming.

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:43.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not be late!”

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:45.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:47.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient and be faithful.

00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:49.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust in Jehovah.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in verse 4,

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:55.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives Habakkuk
tremendous encouragement

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:59.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and encouragement
that is so practical for you and me today.

00:05:00.612 --> 00:05:02.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last portion of verse 4.

00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that, please.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the righteous one [that’s Habakkuk]

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:12.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
will live by his faithfulness.”

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:17.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous one”—that’s you and me.

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are trying to be righteous.

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to hold to Jehovah’s standards.

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love Jehovah.

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:24.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Jehovah says,

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Just live by faithfulness;
live by faithfulness.’

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:05:30.392 --> 00:05:33.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
That statement
is more important than ever before.

00:05:33.103 --> 00:05:35.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation”

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:38.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the things
that Jehovah says will come true

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the confidence and the conviction
that everything Jehovah says

00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:45.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be
in our best interests—faithful.

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:49.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to be faithful
more than ever before

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:51.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
because look at how Jehovah
has allowed wickedness

00:05:51.872 --> 00:05:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
to increase, proliferate.

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:55.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is so wicked today

00:05:57.252 --> 00:05:59.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the websites that one can stumble onto,

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:05.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wicked websites
that can take one’s spirituality away.

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more that Jehovah
allows wickedness, violence, and so forth

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:14.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proliferate on the earth,
that’s more of a test of our love for him.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
How deep is our devotion to Jehovah?

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:18.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much do we love him?

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is in our hearts?

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
It causes us to take a stand.

00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
So being faithful

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not simply a mental  acknowledgment
that ‘I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.’

00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:31.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, rather, being faithful

00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:37.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
means complete trust in Jehovah’s promises

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being firmly convinced

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:44.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
that whatever Jehovah asks us to do
is in our best interests

00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:50.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
—complete trust in Jehovah’s promises

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:52.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being firmly convinced,

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:55.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
having this conviction
and being firmly persuaded,

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
that whatever Jehovah asks us to do

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in our best interests.

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
This point is so powerful that Paul quoted it
three times in the Greek Scriptures.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:10.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Faith”—over 500 times it’s in the Bible
(we could go on and on);

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s how important this word “faith” is.

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:18.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s what Jehovah
now is telling Habakkuk.

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:22.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now, chapter 3 and verse 2,

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:24.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does one build confidence?

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:25.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does one build faith?

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:27.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapter 3 and verse 2:

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, I have heard
the report about you.”

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Habakkuk did:

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
He meditated on Jehovah
and the reports about Him.

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:40.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
What reports?

00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, the Red Sea, Jericho,

00:07:42.524 --> 00:07:46.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
185,000 Assyrians killed in Hezekiah’s day

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:49.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these were reports Habakkuk meditated on,

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:51.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it built his confidence in Jehovah.

00:07:51.992 --> 00:07:55.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he says:
“I am in awe, O Jehovah, of your activity.”

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:58.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s activity is fear-inspiring.

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:00.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what it does for us too

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:04.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we meditate on all that Jehovah
has done for his people today,

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:06.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of prophecies.

00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:07.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder Habakkuk said:

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the midst of the years bring it to life!”

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Bring it back, dear Father, bring it back.

00:08:13.138 --> 00:08:16.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I am confident you will revive your activity

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of faithful ones.’

00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s, again, our prayer.

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:28.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
In spite of the difficult conditions
Habakkuk lived in and had to face,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
after meditating on Jehovah’s activity,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk was moved to utter what may be

00:08:34.326 --> 00:08:39.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the most memorable
expressions ever expressed

00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:42.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an expression of confidence—
by a human.

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:46.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s in verse 18 of chapter 3:

00:08:47.422 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet, as for me, I will exult in Jehovah;

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:54.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation,”

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of the challenges.

00:08:56.973 --> 00:09:00.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means, literally, “jump for joy.”

00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to spin around.

00:09:01.978 --> 00:09:04.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to spin around in my love for you

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joy for you, my delight in God.’

00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:11.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful expression of confidence
that Habakkuk had!

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk disappears from the account,
but his message remains.

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:19.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that message is loud and clear

00:09:19.246 --> 00:09:23.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you and me today: Trust in Jehovah.

00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:26.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do that with our acts of worship

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:29.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
—each time we trust in Jehovah
and show him how much we love him

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:31.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of our problems—

00:09:31.508 --> 00:09:35.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s heart rejoices
and he loves our worship.

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:40.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in confidence, let us trust in Jehovah,

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:42.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Habakkuk,

00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:45.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pour out our anxieties
and concerns to our heavenly Father.

00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:49.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pay attention to prophecy:
“It will not be late!”

00:09:49.443 --> 00:09:51.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And above all, let’s be patient;

00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:55.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s be faithful
as we wait on our God of salvation.
