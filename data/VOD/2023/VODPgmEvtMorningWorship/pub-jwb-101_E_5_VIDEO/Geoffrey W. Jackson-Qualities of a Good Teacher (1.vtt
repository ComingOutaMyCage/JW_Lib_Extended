00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:05.355 line:10% position:50% align:center
How would you define a good teacher?

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.757 line:10% position:50% align:center
That’s an interesting question, isn’t it?

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
For many of us,

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
perhaps we might answer by saying

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.164 line:10% position:50% align:center
what we think a good speaker is like.

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:15.498 line:10% position:50% align:center
We might say,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The brother uses 
many illustrations in his talk”

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:23.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “He was able to highlight a scripture
that I’ve read many times,

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and yet for the first time,
I’ve seen something interesting

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:28.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that that I’ve never seen before.”

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps we might say,

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was able to keep my interest
right through the 60 minutes.”

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are all sorts of different ways

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:42.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could say that someone is a good teacher.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:47.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the best compliment 
someone could receive is if they’re told

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
that their teaching is similar
to that of Jesus Christ,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:54.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know he set
a wonderful example for all of us.

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we’re
thinking about the qualifications

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone to be a good teacher,

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:03.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s turn our attention
to the words of the apostle Paul.

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:05.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you turn with me, please,

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:10.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8,

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
here we see, in addition to some 
of the matters that we just discussed,

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
other aspects
or other qualities that are required

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:23.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone
really to be an effective teacher.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8:

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:32.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the contrary, 
we became gentle in your midst,

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as when a nursing mother 
tenderly cares for her own children.

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:39.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only the good news of God
but also our very selves.”

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:51.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you notice
some of the qualities, or attributes,

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
here that the apostle Paul mentions

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
as being very important
with regard to our teaching?

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 8, it mentions “tender affection.”

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
So love is very much connected

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:09.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
with someone 
having the ability to be a good teacher.

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:12.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, to reach the heart of the student,

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:15.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to display love as well, don’t we?

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:19.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without reaching the heart 
of the student we’re trying to teach,

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like enjoying a meal in a dream.

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:27.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
There really is no benefit at all.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we teach
but don’t reach the heart of the student,

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it really is 
of very little value to the student.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then looking on, notice it says that Paul

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
was “determined to impart”

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just the message of the good news

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his very self.

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:50.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, 
he put his whole heart into teaching others.

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:53.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s look up at verse 7.

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:57.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I feel quite confident
in saying that probably none of us

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have listed this quality
as being essential for a good teacher.

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:03.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he start?

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:06.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We became gentle in your midst.”

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:09.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, honestly,
that probably isn’t the first quality

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would come to your mind 
with regard to a teacher.

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s meant
by this expression to be “gentle”?

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:20.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one Bible scholar made this comment.

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that this word 
that’s translated “gentle”

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was frequently used by Greek writers

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:32.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as characterizing
a nurse with trying children

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a teacher with refractory scholars.”

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I had to look up the word “refractory”
and add it to my vocabulary.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:44.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means, basically, “difficult to control,

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:49.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
resisting authority, 
unmanageable, unresponsive.”

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:54.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do we see an interesting thought here?

00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:59.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gentleness 
has a firmness and stability about it

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:02.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that isn’t rocked or shaken easily

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:06.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the negative response 
of the one that’s being taught.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that an interesting quality?

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt we’ve all tried to display that,

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps as we’re trying to teach
someone something about the Scriptures

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:22.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come across the thought 
that this person doesn’t really accept it.

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We state the fact,

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show our scripture, 
but they still may have a problem.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we react?

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:34.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, if we were to demand 
that they accept what we say

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we said it 
or because the Scriptures say it

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
without reasoning with that person,

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
then, really, we don’t have that gentleness

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the apostle Paul is referring to here.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that stability under pressure

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a loving way convinces someone

00:04:56.446 --> 00:05:00.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
of something that perhaps
they’re not so responsive to.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that open our minds

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:06.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
to another aspect
of what is involved with good teaching?

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, by contrast, if we look back
at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:15.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see that the apostle Paul
in verses 5 and 6

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us a contrast about the type of things

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we wouldn’t want to do as a teacher.

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that in verses 5 and 6:

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:30.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, you know that we never
used flattering speech

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or put on any false front
with greedy motives;

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:36.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is witness!

00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:39.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nor have we been seeking glory from men,

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“either from you or from others,

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
though we could be 
an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.”

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are these negative things
that we certainly would want to avoid

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
if want to be an effective teacher?

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice that first one, 
“flattering speech.”

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this reminds us of another scripture.

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn across to Proverbs 28:23,

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is a good reminder for all of us.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Whoever reproves a man

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or corrects his thinking]

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will afterward find more favor

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
than someone who flatters with his tongue.”

00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:24.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the point that is being made there?

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:28.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
That flattery is not really an effective way

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:32.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to gain someone’s confidence,

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, it’s by honestly correcting
the thinking of someone else.

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:41.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with our Bible students or whatever level 
of teaching that we’re doing,

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:46.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to remember
that part of the process of teaching involves

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving counsel or direction
in correcting wrong viewpoints.

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:54.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us not to do that in a loving way

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
really shows that we don’t love
the person properly

00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t really want them 
to change their wrong thinking.

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:06.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
So avoiding “flattering speech”
is very important.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:09.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Going back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the second point that Paul mentions?

00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:16.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
A “false front with greedy motives.”

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a false front is pretending
to be someone that you’re not.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:25.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
So none of us would ever want to put across

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:28.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
a self-righteous viewpoint

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:32.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to convince others
that we are holier than they are,

00:07:32.768 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as it says here, 
it’s to not have that “false front.”

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:38.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it mentions “greedy motives.”

00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, there’s a marginal reference

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:45.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that takes us across to Acts 20:33.

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:47.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
There the apostle Paul says:

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:52.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have desired 
no man’s silver or gold or clothing.”

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
So certainly as a teacher of the good news,

00:07:57.126 --> 00:08:01.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t want to expect 
some benefits or something

00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:05.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would come back to us
by means of our teaching.

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:09.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
There the apostle Paul 
sets a good standard for us.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:11.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 6,

00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:15.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said that he wasn’t 
‘seeking the glory of men,’

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:20.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
or as one translation says,
“insisting on our own dignity.”

00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:24.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it could be that if we’re a teacher,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may feel that we deserve
a certain measure of respect.

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:33.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our position 
is a little higher than the student.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we really feel that way deep inside,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s going to affect our attitude

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to being gentle, won’t it?

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:46.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if someone questions what we say

00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:50.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if it looks like they’re not dignifying us 
in a proper manner,

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:53.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we will lose that firm gentleness

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:56.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps correct the thinking of others.

00:08:57.119 --> 00:09:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when we think about all these
various attributes and qualities

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are needed for us to be a good teacher,

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:07.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps we might feel 
that there’s a lot we can work on, I’m sure.

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that way as well.

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:11.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a continual battle
—isn’t it?—for us to continue

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:14.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to be effective teachers.

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:18.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is one word of encouragement
we gain from the book of Philippians.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a final scripture,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 2:13:

00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God is the one who for the sake
of his good pleasure energizes you,

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“giving you both [notice] the desire

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[yes, so the desire 
for us to impart the truth

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a loving manner to others and then also]

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:42.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the power to act.”

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:46.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we consider our teaching abilities,

00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:48.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t just think of techniques.

00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:52.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
But always remember 
that when we’re a good teacher,

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to be gentle in the midst of others

00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:59.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help them in a loving way
to correct wrong thoughts.
