00:00:01 How would you define a good teacher?
00:00:05 That’s an interesting question, isn’t it?
00:00:07 For many of us,
00:00:09 perhaps we might answer by saying
00:00:11 what we think a good speaker is like.
00:00:14 We might say,
00:00:15 “The brother uses  many illustrations in his talk”
00:00:19 or “He was able to highlight a scripture that I’ve read many times,
00:00:23 “and yet for the first time, I’ve seen something interesting
00:00:26 in that that I’ve never seen before.”
00:00:28 Or perhaps we might say,
00:00:31 “He was able to keep my interest right through the 60 minutes.”
00:00:36 Well, there are all sorts of different ways
00:00:38 we could say that someone is a good teacher.
00:00:42 Of course, the best compliment  someone could receive is if they’re told
00:00:47 that their teaching is similar to that of Jesus Christ,
00:00:50 because we know he set a wonderful example for all of us.
00:00:54 But as we’re thinking about the qualifications
00:00:57 for someone to be a good teacher,
00:00:59 let’s turn our attention to the words of the apostle Paul.
00:01:03 And if you turn with me, please,
00:01:05 to 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8,
00:01:11 here we see, in addition to some  of the matters that we just discussed,
00:01:16 other aspects or other qualities that are required
00:01:20 for someone really to be an effective teacher.
00:01:23 So that’s 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8:
00:01:27 “On the contrary,  we became gentle in your midst,
00:01:32 “as when a nursing mother  tenderly cares for her own children.
00:01:36 “So having tender affection for you,
00:01:39 “we were determined to impart to you,
00:01:42 not only the good news of God but also our very selves.”
00:01:48 Do you notice some of the qualities, or attributes,
00:01:51 here that the apostle Paul mentions
00:01:53 as being very important with regard to our teaching?
00:01:57 In verse 8, it mentions “tender affection.”
00:02:01 So love is very much connected
00:02:05 with someone  having the ability to be a good teacher.
00:02:09 In fact, to reach the heart of the student,
00:02:12 we have to display love as well, don’t we?
00:02:15 Without reaching the heart  of the student we’re trying to teach,
00:02:19 it’s like enjoying a meal in a dream.
00:02:24 There really is no benefit at all.
00:02:27 So if we teach but don’t reach the heart of the student,
00:02:30 then it really is  of very little value to the student.
00:02:34 Then looking on, notice it says that Paul
00:02:37 was “determined to impart”
00:02:40 not just the message of the good news
00:02:43 but his very self.
00:02:45 In other words,  he put his whole heart into teaching others.
00:02:51 But let’s look up at verse 7.
00:02:53 Now, I feel quite confident in saying that probably none of us
00:02:57 would have listed this quality as being essential for a good teacher.
00:03:01 How does he start?
00:03:03 “We became gentle in your midst.”
00:03:06 Now, honestly, that probably isn’t the first quality
00:03:09 that would come to your mind  with regard to a teacher.
00:03:13 But what’s meant by this expression to be “gentle”?
00:03:17 Well, one Bible scholar made this comment.
00:03:20 He said that this word  that’s translated “gentle”
00:03:24 “was frequently used by Greek writers
00:03:27 “as characterizing a nurse with trying children
00:03:32 or a teacher with refractory scholars.”
00:03:36 Now, I had to look up the word “refractory” and add it to my vocabulary.
00:03:40 It means, basically, “difficult to control,
00:03:44 resisting authority,  unmanageable, unresponsive.”
00:03:50 Well, do we see an interesting thought here?
00:03:54 This gentleness  has a firmness and stability about it
00:03:59 that isn’t rocked or shaken easily
00:04:02 by the negative response  of the one that’s being taught.
00:04:06 Isn’t that an interesting quality?
00:04:09 And no doubt we’ve all tried to display that,
00:04:12 perhaps as we’re trying to teach someone something about the Scriptures
00:04:17 and come across the thought  that this person doesn’t really accept it.
00:04:22 We state the fact,
00:04:24 we show our scripture,  but they still may have a problem.
00:04:28 Well, how do we react?
00:04:30 You see, if we were to demand  that they accept what we say
00:04:34 because we said it  or because the Scriptures say it
00:04:38 without reasoning with that person,
00:04:41 then, really, we don’t have that gentleness
00:04:44 that the apostle Paul is referring to here.
00:04:48 So that stability under pressure
00:04:51 in a loving way convinces someone
00:04:56 of something that perhaps they’re not so responsive to.
00:05:00 Doesn’t that open our minds
00:05:02 to another aspect of what is involved with good teaching?
00:05:06 Now, by contrast, if we look back at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:05:11 we’ll see that the apostle Paul in verses 5 and 6
00:05:15 gives us a contrast about the type of things
00:05:18 that we wouldn’t want to do as a teacher.
00:05:22 Let’s read that in verses 5 and 6:
00:05:25 “In fact, you know that we never used flattering speech
00:05:30 “or put on any false front with greedy motives;
00:05:34 “God is witness!
00:05:36 “Nor have we been seeking glory from men,
00:05:39 “either from you or from others,
00:05:41 though we could be  an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.”
00:05:46 So, what are these negative things that we certainly would want to avoid
00:05:50 if want to be an effective teacher?
00:05:53 Well, notice that first one,  “flattering speech.”
00:05:57 Now, this reminds us of another scripture.
00:05:59 Let’s turn across to Proverbs 28:23,
00:06:04 and this is a good reminder for all of us.
00:06:08 It says: “Whoever reproves a man
00:06:11 “[or corrects his thinking]
00:06:14 “will afterward find more favor
00:06:17 than someone who flatters with his tongue.”
00:06:21 Do we see the point that is being made there?
00:06:24 That flattery is not really an effective way
00:06:28 for us to gain someone’s confidence,
00:06:32 but, rather, it’s by honestly correcting the thinking of someone else.
00:06:36 So with our Bible students or whatever level  of teaching that we’re doing,
00:06:41 we need to remember that part of the process of teaching involves
00:06:46 giving counsel or direction in correcting wrong viewpoints.
00:06:51 For us not to do that in a loving way
00:06:54 really shows that we don’t love the person properly
00:06:58 because we don’t really want them  to change their wrong thinking.
00:07:02 So avoiding “flattering speech” is very important.
00:07:06 Going back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:07:09 what’s the second point that Paul mentions?
00:07:12 A “false front with greedy motives.”
00:07:17 So a false front is pretending to be someone that you’re not.
00:07:22 So none of us would ever want to put across
00:07:25 a self-righteous viewpoint
00:07:28 to try to convince others that we are holier than they are,
00:07:32 but as it says here,  it’s to not have that “false front.”
00:07:35 And then it mentions “greedy motives.”
00:07:38 You see, there’s a marginal reference
00:07:41 that takes us across to Acts 20:33.
00:07:45 There the apostle Paul says:
00:07:47 “I have desired  no man’s silver or gold or clothing.”
00:07:53 So certainly as a teacher of the good news,
00:07:57 we wouldn’t want to expect  some benefits or something
00:08:01 that would come back to us by means of our teaching.
00:08:05 There the apostle Paul  sets a good standard for us.
00:08:09 And then in verse 6,
00:08:11 he said that he wasn’t  ‘seeking the glory of men,’
00:08:15 or as one translation says, “insisting on our own dignity.”
00:08:21 So it could be that if we’re a teacher,
00:08:24 we may feel that we deserve a certain measure of respect.
00:08:29 Yes, our position  is a little higher than the student.
00:08:33 If we really feel that way deep inside,
00:08:37 that’s going to affect our attitude
00:08:40 with regard to being gentle, won’t it?
00:08:42 Because if someone questions what we say
00:08:46 or if it looks like they’re not dignifying us  in a proper manner,
00:08:50 then we will lose that firm gentleness
00:08:53 that helps correct the thinking of others.
00:08:57 Well, when we think about all these various attributes and qualities
00:09:00 that are needed for us to be a good teacher,
00:09:03 perhaps we might feel  that there’s a lot we can work on, I’m sure.
00:09:07 I feel that way as well.
00:09:08 It’s a continual battle —isn’t it?—for us to continue
00:09:11 to try to be effective teachers.
00:09:14 Here is one word of encouragement we gain from the book of Philippians.
00:09:18 As a final scripture,
00:09:20 Philippians 2:13:
00:09:25 “For God is the one who for the sake of his good pleasure energizes you,
00:09:30 “giving you both [notice] the desire
00:09:33 “[yes, so the desire  for us to impart the truth
00:09:37 “in a loving manner to others and then also]
00:09:40 and the power to act.”
00:09:42 So as we consider our teaching abilities,
00:09:46 don’t just think of techniques.
00:09:48 But always remember  that when we’re a good teacher,
00:09:52 we need to be gentle in the midst of others
00:09:55 and help them in a loving way to correct wrong thoughts.
