00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:04.233 line:10% position:50% align:center
Over the years, a number of popular songs

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
have romanticized divorce.

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:11.866 line:10% position:50% align:center
But anyone who has personally experienced

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:15.370 line:10% position:50% align:center
the pain and trauma associated with divorce

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
knows that it couldn’t have been part
of Jehovah’s original purpose.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, in fact,
the Scriptures indicate

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when Jehovah performed

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first marriage
of Adam and Eve,

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:33.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
He intended for it
to be a permanent arrangement.

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all,
it was a match made in heaven,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
so to speak.

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:40.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created the man,

00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:45.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then He created the perfect complement
—Eve.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
And had they been obedient,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam and Eve would be married today.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with their disobedience
came a whole range of serious problems,

00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:00.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they impacted the marriage arrangement.

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with imperfection came sin

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then death.

00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:10.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
And death ends a marriage.

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:14.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s something Jehovah never had in mind.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
And further indicating the complications

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:22.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and negative effects
of imperfection on marriage

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the provision for divorce

00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:29.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in the Mosaic Law
at Deuteronomy 24:1.

00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:32.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s a question:

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:34.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the fact
that Jehovah made a provision for divorce

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:36.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Mosaic Law

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:40.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicate that he was relaxing his view

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:44.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that he had changed
his thinking on marriage?

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:46.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in his words as recorded

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:50.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Malachi 2:16,

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:52.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 1,000 years

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the words recorded
in Deuteronomy 24,

00:01:56.437 --> 00:02:00.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that Jehovah
had not changed his thinking.

00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:02.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stated very simply:

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I hate divorce.”

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:10.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what was the situation in Malachi’s day?

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:15.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
The provision for divorce
had been distorted and abused,

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and men were divorcing their wives
“on every sort of grounds,”

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
resulting in heartbreak

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:25.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also in reproach on Jehovah’s name.

00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:30.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I hate divorce.”

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:33.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see why
Jehovah would have said those words.

00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:36.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Had the situation improved any

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:39.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry?

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:41.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures indicate not.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:46.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly,
the secular historian Josephus

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:50.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates that men
could divorce their wives

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:55.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
on any basis whatsoever,
and they did.

00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:58.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, true to form,

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:01.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus forthrightly addressed the subject

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:04.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least twice
in the course of his earthly ministry,

00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:06.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in the Scriptures.

00:03:06.471 --> 00:03:11.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first occasion took place
in the year 31 C.E.

00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:13.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometime after Passover.

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:17.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words are recorded
in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:21.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there he said:
‘Everyone who divorces his wife,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘except on the grounds of sexual immorality,

00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:27.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and marries another

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:29.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
commits adultery.’

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:33.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was raising the bar.

00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, when you think about it,
under the Mosaic Law,

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:39.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
sexual immorality

00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:41.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
(adultery)

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a capital offense
that would have brought death.

00:03:46.973 --> 00:03:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the fact
that Jesus said sexual immorality

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the only basis for divorce

00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:58.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to appreciate
how seriously he and his Father view

00:03:58.402 --> 00:04:00.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
the marriage arrangement.

00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:03.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second occasion

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:06.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which Jesus addressed the subject

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
came more than a year later
—late in the year 32 C.E.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the account
that we read about in today’s text.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:18.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parallel account in Mark chapter 10

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
shares some additional insight.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:22.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to take
just a few minutes this morning

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and analyze Jesus’ words

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Mark chapter 10,
beginning in verse 2.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we invite you to turn there.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Mark 10:2,

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:44.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “Pharisees approached,
intent on testing [Jesus],

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they asked whether it was lawful

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a man to divorce a wife.”

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now the Pharisees
are introducing the thought of the law,

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:57.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Mark reveals that Jesus

00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:01.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
directed attention specifically
to the Mosaic Law.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What did Moses command you?”

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:08.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Pharisees said:

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:11.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moses allowed the writing
of a certificate of dismissal

00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:13.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and divorcing her.”

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:18.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they conveniently remembered
the “certificate of dismissal” part,

00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:21.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they forgot that divorce was allowed

00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:26.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
only for very serious matters.

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:30.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Matthew’s account
indicates that by Jesus’ day,

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:34.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were divorcing
“on every sort of grounds.”

00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:36.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jesus address this?

00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he said to them in verse 5:

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:41.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Out of regard for your hard-heartedness,

00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:44.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he wrote this commandment for you.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, from the beginning of creation

00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:51.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and then you’ll notice a quotation mark;

00:05:51.064 --> 00:05:55.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so Jesus is now quoting
from the Genesis account],

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘He made them male and female

00:05:58.197 --> 00:06:00.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[Genesis 1:27].

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:05.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For this reason a man
will leave his father and his mother,

00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:08.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the two will be one flesh

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:12.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Genesis 2:24].’”

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jesus adds:

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:19.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, what God has yoked together,

00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:25.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
let no man put apart.”

00:06:27.562 --> 00:06:32.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the disciples were impressed

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:37.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
by this very high standard
that Jesus was explaining.

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they were again in the house,
[they] began to question him about this.”

00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus again forthrightly makes the point:

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:46.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to them:

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Whoever divorces his wife
and marries another

00:06:50.837 --> 00:06:52.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘commits adultery against her,

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and if ever a woman

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:57.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘after divorcing her husband
marries another,

00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
she commits adultery.’”

00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:04.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you think Jesus

00:07:04.185 --> 00:07:06.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
might have insisted

00:07:06.812 --> 00:07:10.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Pharisees focus on Moses’ words?

00:07:12.444 --> 00:07:14.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it certainly provided him
an opportunity

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
to clarify the matter
—didn’t it?—

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:21.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to restate Jehovah’s thinking

00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:24.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the sacredness of marriage.

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:27.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus added these words:

00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:30.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What God has yoked together,

00:07:30.254 --> 00:07:33.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
let no man put apart.”

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:37.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah is personally interested
in each marriage.

00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:42.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that elevates the relationship as well,
doesn’t it?

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:46.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can you and I learn
from Jesus’ words

00:07:46.897 --> 00:07:50.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us
if we’re married

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if we’re single
and contemplating marriage?

00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:57.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are two points:

00:07:57.492 --> 00:08:00.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus made very clear

00:08:00.162 --> 00:08:03.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his followers would be elevated

00:08:03.832 --> 00:08:08.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hold to Jehovah’s original standard
for marriage,

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:12.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
not the corrupted standard

00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:15.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Jewish religious leaders promoted.

00:08:15.803 --> 00:08:20.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by introducing this thought
that Jehovah is involved,

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:25.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
he helped us to see
the seriousness of the situation.

00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:28.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the apostle Paul,
in his letter to the Ephesians,

00:08:28.734 --> 00:08:32.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
confirmed that Christians would hold

00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:35.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s original standard

00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:38.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a man and a wife

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:42.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the only valid basis
for a Scriptural divorce

00:08:42.624 --> 00:08:45.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be sexual immorality.

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:48.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a second point:

00:08:48.338 --> 00:08:53.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus put Christian men and women
on equal footing,

00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:55.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
morally speaking.

00:08:55.388 --> 00:08:59.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both husband and wife would be responsible

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
for protecting their marriage

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:07.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for upholding the sanctity of marriage.

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:11.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we find Jesus’ words at Mark 10:12

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
interesting as well:

00:09:14.074 --> 00:09:18.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If ever a woman after divorcing her husband
marries another,

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:21.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
she commits adultery.”

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus makes clear

00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a faithful servant of God

00:09:27.172 --> 00:09:29.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is a woman

00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:33.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
can divorce an adulterous husband.

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:36.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would have been food for thought

00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:39.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jewish men and women in Jesus’ day.

00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:45.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we appreciate
Jesus’ view and Jehovah’s view of marriage!

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here at Bethel,
we have many married couples.

00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:51.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the congregations around the earth,

00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:54.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are faithful men and women

00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:59.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
who respect and cherish
the sanctity of marriage.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:02.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re so glad for that,

00:10:02.043 --> 00:10:06.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re determined
—whether married or single—

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:11.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
to uphold Jehovah’s view
of the sacred marriage arrangement.
