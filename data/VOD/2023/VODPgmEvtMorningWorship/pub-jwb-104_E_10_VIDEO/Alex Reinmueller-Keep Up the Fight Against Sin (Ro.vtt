00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some years ago,

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.442 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  quoted a religion writer

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.696 line:10% position:50% align:center
who said: “We no longer see ourselves

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:11.365 line:10% position:50% align:center
“as ‘sinners’ in need of forgiveness.

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:13.909 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Maybe sin used to be a problem,

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.453 line:10% position:50% align:center
“but now we’ve outgrown that.

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:20.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So while the church has a solution
for the problem of sin,

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:24.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a non-problem
in the eyes of most Americans.”

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that statement was made
about 25 years ago,

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and today many more people
around the world share that view.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is sin?

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is it related to freedom?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why is it still a problem
even for us as Christians?

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his letter to the Romans,

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul discusses the power of sin

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can control it.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says
that all unrighteousness is sin,

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that includes anything
that disturbs our relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul explains at Romans 5:12

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “through one man [Adam] sin
entered into the world

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and death through sin,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and so death spread to all men

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he adds in chapter 7:

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I do not do the good that I wish,

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:26.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the bad that I do not wish
is what I practice.”

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re honest, all of us have to admit

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the same has been true for us.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sin is not just what we do

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what we don’t do.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Insight </i> book explains

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it is also
a “<i>governing principle </i> or <i>force”</i>

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
that operates inside of us.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s a scary thought
when you think about it.

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul describes in his letter sin as a “law”

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is trying to control our actions.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
He calls it a “king” that gives orders

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
in different ways
to different persons at different times.

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these vivid analogies that Paul uses

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
are intended to help us understand
just how powerful,

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
how relentless, inherited sin really is.

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
That power quickly became evident

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Adam and Eve
were expelled from the garden of Eden.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Genesis chapter 4,

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:32.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah accepted Abel’s sacrifice

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
but rejected Cain’s,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible tells us that Cain
became ‘very angry and dejected.’

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Cain didn’t realize
that the intense feelings he was experiencing

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
were not merely the natural human emotions
he was created with.

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the sin
that he inherited from his parents

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was trying to control him.

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah
immediately explained this to Cain.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
He warned him of the potential consequences.

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:
“Sin is crouching at the door, [Cain],

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:13.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and its craving is to dominate you;

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will you get the mastery over it?”

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, as we know, Cain
did not listen to Jehovah

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:25.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he allowed that sin
to get control, or mastery, over him.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And eventually he killed his own brother.

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said at John 8:34

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:34.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “every doer of sin is a slave of sin.”

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no escaping that.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t outgrow this problem of sin
as we get older.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re foolish to simply ignore it.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sin is the worst kind of slavery

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans have experienced.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only can it mislead us
into doing what’s bad,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it can also prevent us
from doing what we know to be right

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
or from living up to
what we know we’re capable of

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s sight.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings to our mind
Paul’s painful admission

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:13.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Romans chapter 7.

00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:14.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know it well.

00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:17.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
But please turn in your Bibles
with me there now,

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read his familiar words
together again there

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 21 through 24.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us does not identify

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:29.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the daily struggle
that Paul describes here?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 21 says:

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I find, then, this law in my case:

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:39.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I wish to do what is right,

00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:42.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what is bad is present with me.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:47.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I really delight in the law of God
according to the man I am within,

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I see in my body another law

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:53.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“warring against the law of my mind

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:58.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and leading me captive to sin’s law
that is in my body.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Miserable man that I am!

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who will rescue me
from the body undergoing this death?”

00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:08.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, by the time that Paul wrote this letter,

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had been in the truth for over 20 years.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
He served as “an apostle to the nations”
for almost ten of those years,

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet sin was still crouching at his door.

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was still trying to dominate him.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:29.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
What weaknesses did Paul have to overcome?

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:31.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know for sure,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he did write to Timothy once

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:38.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had formerly been “an insolent man.”

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:40.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And before his conversion,

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:43.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said he was extremely mad
at the Christians

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:45.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persecuted them.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, Paul learned to control his temper
after becoming a Christian,

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:56.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there were still times
when he struggled to control his feelings

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his words.

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:02.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion, the Bible says
that “there was a sharp burst of anger”

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:05.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
between him
and his close companion, Barnabas.

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Paul says, on our own,

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:14.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are helpless
to control the sin inside of us,

00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:18.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet the situation is not hopeless.

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:21.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus promised that at John 8:36:

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:26.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If the Son sets you free,
you will be truly free.”

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep reading
in verse 25 of Romans chapter 7.

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:34.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul concludes by saying:

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:43.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, then, with my mind
I myself am a slave to God’s law,

00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:47.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with my flesh to sin’s law.”

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he accepted
Jehovah’s arrangement for salvation,

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was set free from slavery to ‘King Sin’

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:58.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his sidekick ‘Death.’

00:06:58.522 --> 00:07:01.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a release that was for Paul!

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:05.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can almost hear
the sigh of relief in those words.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what sinful tendencies are you fighting
right now, brothers and sisters?

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:16.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it envy, like Cain
or perhaps your temper, like Paul?

00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is there some other bad attitude or habit
that you just can’t seem to kick?

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:23.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, don’t be discouraged.

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:27.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Paul, we all have our battle with sin.

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:32.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
The solution to the problem of sin is this:

00:07:32.764 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put faith in the ransom,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do your best to “keep walking by spirit.”

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:44.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ransom makes it possible for us
to serve Jehovah God with a clean conscience.

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:46.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a gift that is!

00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:49.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Romans 8:2, Paul says:

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the law of the spirit
that gives life in union with Christ Jesus

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:58.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
has set you free
from the law of sin and of death.”

00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it mean to walk in God’s spirit?

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:06.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it means
making steady spiritual advancement.

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:10.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not mean
striving for spiritual perfection,

00:08:10.344 --> 00:08:13.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is something we can’t do right now.

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:17.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Day by day, to the best of our ability,

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:20.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
we try to walk, or live, our life

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
in accord with the leanings
of God’s holy spirit.

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sin is real; it’s serious.

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:29.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not just a made-up concept

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep our behavior in check.

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:37.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it includes anything
that disturbs our relationship with God.

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:41.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all start out life as a slave of sin.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s help,

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:46.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says
that we can get free from its control

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:48.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep sin from gaining the upper hand.

00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:52.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a real privilege, brothers and sisters,

00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:56.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be serving alongside
men and women like you

00:08:56.431 --> 00:09:00.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are fighting that battle successfully
every day.

00:09:02.104 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please keep up the fight.

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
If possible, keep doing it more fully.

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:08.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do this.

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s do it together.

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:14.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the end of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign,

00:09:14.282 --> 00:09:18.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will vanquish
‘King Sin’ once and for all time.

00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:20.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joy that will be!

00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:24.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will then enjoy what Romans 8:21 says

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:27.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the glorious freedom
of the [sons] of God.”

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:30.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine that we’ll never again
have to ask Jehovah

00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:33.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
for forgiveness of our sins.

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:37.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be able to say to Jehovah
every day like Jesus does:

00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:42.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I always do the things pleasing to [you].”

00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an incredible experience that will be!

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait.

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:51.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the way to true freedom.
