00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:03.386 line:10% position:50% align:center
The theme for my discussion

00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:08.091 line:10% position:50% align:center
is “Never Let Satan Intimidate You.”

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:11.461 line:10% position:50% align:center
To intimidate means to try to get someone

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
to do or not do something by bullying,

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:17.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
terrorizing, threatening them.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course,
Satan is a god of intimidation.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s one way he tries
to get people to do what he wants.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:27.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
Jehovah always motivates by love.

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:29.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “intimidate”

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:32.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found twice in the <i>Study Bible </i> notes.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the word “intimidated”

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:38.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found once in the main text of our Bible,

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 1:17,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:44.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the judges
who were to assist Moses were told:

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do not be intimidated by men;

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
render impartial judgment.’

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, even though these words

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not used so much in the Bible,

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea is found many times.

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:03.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a few examples, think of Goliath
—who was nine and a half feet (2.9 m) tall—

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to intimidate young David.

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:08.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what he said to him?

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Samuel chapter 17, he said:

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:15.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just come to me,
and I will give your flesh

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:19.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the birds of the heavens
and to the beasts of the field.”

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:21.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Just come to me, little boy,

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:25.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ll feed your corpse
to the buzzards and hyenas’

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
—big-time intimidation.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what about the Rabshakeh

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
in loud, fluent Hebrew
trying to intimidate the Jews

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:35.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the time of Hezekiah

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Sanballat and Tobiah

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:43.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to ridicule Nehemiah and the Jews
for building the wall?

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or another example
found in today’s <i>Watchtower </i> comments

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that Nebuchadnezzar
really tried to intimidate the three Hebrews

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
into worshiping an idol.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he do it?

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Daniel 3:1 says

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:01.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
he erected an immense image

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
almost 90 feet (27.4 m) tall
and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide,

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:07.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was intimidating in itself.

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:10.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he assembled, according to verse 2,

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge throng of people:
“satraps, prefects, governors, advisers,”

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:19.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
etcetera, etcetera
—an intimidating throng.

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verses 4-6,

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:25.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had it loudly proclaimed:
‘You are commanded, . . .

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:28.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when you hear the horn,
the pipe, the zither, . . .

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:31.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘you must fall down and worship this image.

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And anyone who does not do so immediately

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be thrown
into the burning, fiery furnace.’

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very intimidating

00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:45.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but those three Hebrews
remained unintimidated.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
But of course, Satan, as we said,

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
still tries to use intimidation today.

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:56.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you don’t take this blood transfusion,
you will surely die.’

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you don’t accept this job

00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘(talking about a job
that’ll damage you spiritually),

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
your family will starve.’

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why won’t you smoke this cigarette?

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you afraid?
Are you chicken?’

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why won’t you date
this girl in your class who likes you?

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:14.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a homosexual?’

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:18.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Satan uses intimidation.

00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:20.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 5:8 says

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:23.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Devil
“walks about like a roaring lion.”

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
And often those roars
take the form of intimidation

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:31.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
—kind of like the roars of a literal lion,

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:36.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the <i>Insight </i> book,
are calculated to cause domestic animals

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stampede and break out
of their protective enclosure.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now, here’s a question:

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:48.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we learn
from those three Hebrews

00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us
to never let Satan intimidate us?

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are a few lessons.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
One: Never quit trusting Jehovah

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all your heart
despite the roars of the Devil.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you go to Daniel chapter 3,

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:09.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how they put implicit trust in Jehovah

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite this intimidating situation

00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:14.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 3, verse 16:

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:20.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“answered the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar,

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:24.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘we have no need
to answer you in this matter.

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:27.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If it must be, our God whom we serve

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:31.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is able to rescue us
from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:34.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and to rescue us from your hand.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But even if he does not,
let it be known to you, O king,

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:42.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that we will not serve your gods

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:46.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.’”

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, they trusted Jehovah.

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another lesson:

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:54.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holy spirit will help us remain calm

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:56.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not panic—

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give a good answer to our persecutors.

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:01.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about what we just read,
the answer they gave

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
—amazing composure—

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
amazing answer they gave.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, holy spirit
was working powerfully upon them.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re promised
the same will be true for us.

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 12:11, 12, Jesus said:

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they bring you in
before public assemblies,

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:21.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“government officials, and authorities,

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:24.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not become anxious
about . . . what you will say,

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:29.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the holy spirit will teach you
in that very hour” what to say.

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another lesson:

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can use his powerful angels

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue us from an intimidating situation.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:42.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the case of the three Hebrews,
they were rescued miraculously.

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:45.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the king looked into that furnace,

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of seeing
three men bound being cremated,

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saw four walking about freely,

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fourth obviously an angel.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when they were
brought out of that furnace,

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:03.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel 3:27 says
they didn’t even have “the smell of fire.”

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
No hair of their body was singed.

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:08.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’ve been in homes
where people are smokers

00:06:08.217 --> 00:06:11.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you pick up
that smell of smoke very easily.

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:15.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talking about singeing your hair,
hair singes very easily.

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:20.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time back
I tried to light a gas stove using a match.

00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t get the timing exactly right.

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:27.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
It blew back
—burned about half the hairs off my arm.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here, they didn’t have a hair singed,
not even the smell of smoke.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:36.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, today, we don’t expect Jehovah’s angels

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:38.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deliver us miraculously.

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:43.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah can use them
to maneuver circumstances.

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we find a job to provide for our family.

00:06:47.023 --> 00:06:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we find a cooperative doctor
who respects our stand on blood,

00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
as just a couple of examples.

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or he may use the angels to strengthen us

00:06:56.065 --> 00:07:00.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be faithful
in the face of that fiery test.

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:02.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another lesson we can learn:

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Firm belief in the resurrection

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
can powerfully fortify us,

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’re threatened with death.

00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:13.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undoubtedly, those three Hebrews
knew Job’s words

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Job 14:13,

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Job asked Jehovah
to conceal him in the grave,

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
set a time limit,

00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:23.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then remember him—resurrect him.

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:28.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely, they were familiar
with the resurrections of Elijah and Elisha.

00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:31.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they didn’t know
if they’d be miraculously delivered,

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they did know they would be resurrected
if they kept their integrity.

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:37.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true with us today.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that firm belief in the resurrection,
if you think about it,

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
strips Satan of his power

00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
to intimidate us even in the face of death.

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could say that hope
is like our secret weapon.

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s one more lesson we can learn:

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:57.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remaining staunchly unintimidated

00:07:57.593 --> 00:08:00.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give a powerful witness to onlookers.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what the king said

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:05.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they came out unharmed
from that furnace?

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Praised be the God of Shadrach,

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:12.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meshach, and Abednego, . . .

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for there is no other god

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is able to rescue like this one.”

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about this,

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Nebuchadnezzar
and other Babylonian onlookers

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
are resurrected as part of “the unrighteous”

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:29.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Acts 24:15,

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
this experience will give them
a head start in the new world

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
on taking a stand with Jehovah.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about even the men

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
who threw them
into the furnace who died doing so.

00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if they’re resurrected,

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll be told about what happened
subsequent to their untimely death.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And undoubtedly, that will be an impetus

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:53.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward spiritual progress in the new world.

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the same is true today.

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stand firm, unintimidated,

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
we give a powerful witness.

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:03.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are many that are now in the truth

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a result of such a witness.

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:07.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have five

00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
anti-intimidation lessons

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can learn from those three Hebrews.

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:17.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
In review: Never quit trusting Jehovah

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the roars of the Devil.

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:22.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two: Holy spirit will help us remain calm,

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
not panic, and give a good answer.

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:29.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three: Jehovah can use
his angels in various ways

00:09:29.585 --> 00:09:32.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue us
from intimidating circumstances.

00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:34.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number four:

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
The resurrection hope
will powerfully fortify us

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be intimidated
even in the face of death.

00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:46.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number five:
Remaining staunchly unintimidated

00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:50.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give a profound witness to onlookers.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may all of us,
like those three Hebrews, be determined

00:09:55.811 --> 00:10:00.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
to never let Satan intimidate us.
