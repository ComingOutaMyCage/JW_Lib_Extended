00:00:01.718 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re talking about humility.

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10% position:50% align:center
And from the discussion,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.126 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can appreciate how humility

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:14.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
as a key is much needed if we’re going

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.633 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘to view others as superior to us.’

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s easy to talk about humility.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is another thing to acquire humility,

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:26.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that may be a challenge.

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:28.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the expression, the statement,

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:33.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
made at 1 Peter 5:5,

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the middle of the verse

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:39.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Peter 5:5:

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:43.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But all of you clothe yourselves

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
with humility toward one another.”

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that expression

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:53.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘clothe yourself’ is significant

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:57.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it helps us appreciate

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:59.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humility is a quality

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
that only we personally can put on.

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not inherited.

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, for sure, it doesn’t come naturally.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to do it ourselves,

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:16.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to be willing to do it.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in addition,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
the challenge that we have with humility

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to wear
the garment of humility at all times.

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is so because humility

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:34.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not encouraged in the world right now.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are surrounded by individuals

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:40.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are encouraged
to be proud because of race,

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:44.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
education, natural abilities,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
social status—to “be somebody,” excel.

00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:50.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is the sign of the times

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
—of the time of the end—

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
people are “lovers of themselves, . . .
puffed up with pride.”

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:00.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is not impressed

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the abilities or privileges
or talents that we have

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:06.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, anyway, he gave them to us.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what is recorded

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians 4:7

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:16.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Corinthians 4:7:

00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:21.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who makes you different from another?

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, what do you have
that you did not receive?

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:31.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, in fact, you did receive it,

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do you boast
as though you did not receive it?”

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Plainly stated,

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have it because somebody gave it to us.

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, this is an interesting point:

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not give humility.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to acquire it ourselves;

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s what the scripture said:
‘clothe yourself,’

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah expects that we do it.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not a recommendation.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:08.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how we view ourselves
is important to Jehovah.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
It matters to him.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, therefore, the aspect of humility,

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “consider others
superior to [us],” is important.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it has to be genuine humility.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why do we say genuine humility?

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:32.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because there is a false humility.

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:35.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is mentioned in Colossians chapter 2.

00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And false humility is a desire

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:41.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
to elevate oneself above others

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:45.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
by an outward appearance of humility
just to impress people,

00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:50.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is not going to make us
consider others superior to us.

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:54.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the challenge
that we have with humility is

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:58.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
to wear the garment of genuine humility
at all times.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is real.

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:02.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why?

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:06.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because at times, circumstances may change

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:09.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the better in our situation

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
or circumstances
may not meet our preferences.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that happens,

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:22.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
it impacts how we feel—our feelings.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note this situation as an example:

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hagar, Sarah, and Abraham.

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Genesis chapter 16.

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 16:4 says:

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:43.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So [Abraham] had relations with Hagar,

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and she became pregnant.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When she realized that she was pregnant

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[a change of circumstances
for the better for her],

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:58.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
she began to despise her mistress.”

00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:02.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interesting, the change of feelings.

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:07.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Hagar had a hard time seeing Sarah

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
as superior to her.

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:12.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, from Jehovah’s viewpoint,

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:16.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was the solution to the problem?

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:19.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please go to verse 9 of the same chapter:

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s angel then said to her:

00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:28.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Return to your mistress and [what?]

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:33.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
humble yourself under her hand.’”

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:36.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Clothe [yourself] with humility.”

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another example
of the impact a change of circumstances

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have on displaying humility is Korah.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Korah was a cousin,
a first cousin, of Moses and Aaron;

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a prominent man in Israel;

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:55.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had seen beautiful examples

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:58.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s power and glory.

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:05.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it appears that the unfavorable
circumstances in the wilderness

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:08.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected his view of himself.

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he along with others

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
resented the fact that so far,

00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:19.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We’re not in the Promised Land.’

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:23.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
But also, in addition to that,

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:27.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
as shown at Psalm 106:16,

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:30.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seems that Korah started to envy

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses and Aaron

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:37.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resented their prominence,
their appointment.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could not see them as superior to him.

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, humility would have helped Korah

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:48.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
appreciate that Moses’ and Aaron’s
appointment

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
really came from Jehovah.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
He appointed them for the privilege
that they were enjoying.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
But his lack of humility

00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:02.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused him not just to envy Moses;

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:04.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
it went further than that.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is serious.

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note what happened

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the record
in Numbers chapter 16.

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:17.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Numbers 16:3 says:

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they [Korah and the group]

00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:24.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“gathered together against Moses and Aaron

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to them:
‘We have had enough of you!

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:29.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The whole assembly is holy,

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:32.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘all of them, and Jehovah is in their midst.

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Why, then, should you exalt yourselves

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:38.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
above the congregation of Jehovah?’”

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine saying that

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to an appointment by Jehovah?

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:50.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, this was a serious matter.

00:07:50.353 --> 00:07:53.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lack of humility moved

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
these individuals to rebel.

00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:01.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is a lesson for us
what the lack of humility can lead to.

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tragic end of Korah
makes it very, very clear.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on the other hand, we see

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful example in the sons of Korah.

00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed a humble spirit.

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were happy and content
with being just helpers,

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
or assistants, to the priests.

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interesting, too, humility helped them
not to follow their parents.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it is obvious
as we review this issue of humility

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the garment of humility

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
at all times is needed.

00:08:34.263 --> 00:08:39.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is especially when circumstances
change in our lives for the better

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:42.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our expectations
are not totally fulfilled.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:47.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
But humility can help us
in our day-to-day activities too.

00:08:47.543 --> 00:08:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 15:4 says:

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He does not go back on his promise,

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:56.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when it is bad for him.”

00:08:56.686 --> 00:09:01.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
So humility will help us to be true
to our promise, to our work,

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of to whom we’ve made the promise.

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can see the value

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
of genuine humility as we worship Jehovah.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what will be the reward

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:17.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
for clothing ourselves with humility?

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s read it in Proverbs chapter 22,

00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 4:

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The result of humility

00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:34.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the fear of Jehovah is riches

00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:38.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and glory and life.”

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:40.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful, isn’t it?

00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s worthwhile, clothing
ourselves with humility.
