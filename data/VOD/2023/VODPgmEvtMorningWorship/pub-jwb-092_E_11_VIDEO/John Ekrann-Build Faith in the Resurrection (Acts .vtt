00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:04.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
With these two words for our text today,

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.756 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah brought Tabitha, or Dorcas,

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.692 line:10% position:50% align:center
back to life.

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:11.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
And as our commentators also pointed out,

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.130 line:10% position:50% align:center
the resurrection of the dead has to be

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the most amazing miracles
mentioned in the Bible.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
The restoration of a human body,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the formation of a new body,

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the putting of the memories

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everything that was that person
back into it

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just an amazing demonstration

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:35.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the power of chemistry
and biology and physics

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what Jehovah understands
about life and the universe—

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that is just amazing to us.

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we’re amazed by modern technology,

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe smartphones and computers
and modern medicine,

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:52.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
but those things pale in comparison

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:55.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we think
about the power and understanding

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:59.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it takes for Jehovah
to resurrect a human being.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, for many people,

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:04.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea of the resurrection of the dead

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
really seems far-fetched

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
—maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction,

00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe they may even think
it is just wishful thinking.

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we build our faith and confidence
in the resurrection

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:20.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help others to have faith and confidence

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this wonderful hope as well?

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll discuss just a couple of ways.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we can reason it out by meditating

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:32.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Jehovah’s creative power and who he is.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a couple of examples of men

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:40.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reasoned that Jehovah
must be capable of the resurrection,

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though there hadn’t been
any resurrections up to that point.

00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:45.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider Abraham.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at Hebrews 11:19,

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah had asked him

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer up Isaac,
his son, as a sacrifice,

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:58.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how he reasoned.

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:19:

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:05.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he reasoned that God was able
to raise him up even from the dead,

00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he did receive him from there

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an illustrative way.”

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Abraham was able to reason on the fact
that Jehovah was the Creator

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:19.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that he had
restored Sarah’s reproductive powers.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had resurrected, basically,
her ability to have children.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
He concluded that even if he should

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:31.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
follow through with sacrificing Isaac,

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah could and would
bring him back from the dead.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that knowledge
certainly would have strengthened him

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:40.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthened his resolve to do something

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
that must have been
an extremely difficult thing to ask a father

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to put, basically, his son to death.

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:52.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that hope, that strength of resolve,

00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had was bolstered by the fact

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he understood Jehovah
could bring him back from the dead.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reasoned on it.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Job—he believed in the resurrection.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Job 14:14, 15,

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:09.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Job reasons

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:12.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Jehovah’s capability.

00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:15.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job 14:14, 15:

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If a man dies, can he live again?

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will wait all the days
of my compulsory service

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until my relief comes.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:27.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will call, and I will answer you.

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:31.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will long for the work of your hands.”

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:34.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we keep in mind

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Job wrote these words
after the death of his ten children.

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the pain and suffering
of having just one child die,

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:45.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
for parents, is really tragic.

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
But ten children

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s an unbelievable burden of grief.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:55.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Job reasoned that if he, as their father,

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:58.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
missed his ten children so much,

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:01.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was sure that Jehovah also longed for them

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and missed them as well.

00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:07.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though he had ten more children later,

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:09.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be sure that Job was looking forward

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
to seeing his other dead, lost children

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the resurrection.

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s the first way
of just reasoning on Jehovah’s capability

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:20.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
—knowing who he is and understanding

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he has the capability
to perform resurrections.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:28.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second way is reading accounts
of actual resurrections in the Bible.

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:32.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were nine recorded resurrections
in the Bible.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah resurrected a child.

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha resurrected a child.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha resurrected a man
even after he was dead;

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:45.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
a man got thrown on his dead bones
and got resurrected.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:49.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus resurrected the widow of Nain’s son

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jairus’ daughter,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then also Jesus resurrected Lazarus.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we have Jehovah resurrecting Jesus.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:02.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we have Peter resurrecting Tabitha,
or Dorcas, in our text for today.

00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:06.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we have Paul
resurrecting young Eutychus.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:10.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we look at these resurrections,
we learn several things from them.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some children were resurrected

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:16.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which is certainly comforting for parents
who’ve lost children)

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:20.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some older ones,
like Tabitha and Lazarus.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
One resurrection was done by dead bones.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:27.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophet wasn’t even there,
so no one could claim he worked that one out.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the purpose of the miracles
of the resurrection recorded in the Bible

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to really build faith
that Jehovah and Jesus

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
can and will perform resurrections.

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:43.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really like the way the apostle Paul
says at Acts 17:31

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus’ resurrection

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:50.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“provided a guarantee to all men.”

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like by recording those resurrections
in the Bible,

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is saying:

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:57.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I guarantee that I can do this.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only can you reason on it,
but I’m demonstrating that I can do this.’

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, if death is really like
the Pause button on a remote,

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:08.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the resurrection by Jehovah

00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:10.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like him pressing the Play button

00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume their life.

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:16.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can reason on the fact that Jehovah

00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:20.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the creative ability and the ability

00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:24.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
(like for Abraham and Job)
to perform resurrections.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can read about the actual
resurrections that Jehovah performed.

00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of these give us knowledge

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and faith in the resurrection.

00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does knowledge and faith
in the resurrection hope

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually help us today?

00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:44.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, knowledge gives us
power and strength and courage.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate, one day as a young boy,

00:06:47.423 --> 00:06:50.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was out in the field ministry
and I was going up to a door

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this ferocious dog
came from out of nowhere

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just teeth and all coming right at me—
and I ran for my life.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I got a little ways from him,
and I hear this “thunk.”

00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:04.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized,
‘Oh, that sounds like a chain.’

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
I turned around and, sure enough,
he was chained right there.

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
He couldn’t go any further.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, with the knowledge that he
was chained and couldn’t go any further,

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could walk semicourageously

00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:20.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
up to the door and give my presentation.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Satan snarls; he barks; he threatens.

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:26.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the end, Jehovah limits him,

00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a strong chain, as to what he can do.

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:32.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, even if Satan succeeds in killing us

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:37.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the end of this system or if we die
before the end of this old system,

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:40.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives us
the hope of the resurrection.

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:42.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lets us know that ferocious death

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:46.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot cause us or our loved ones

00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:48.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
any permanent harm.

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:52.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any harm caused by death is temporary.

00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:54.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like that Pause on the remote,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah can easily just press Play.

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:02.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s text is only two words,

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it has tremendous power.

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to try this
and see how it makes you feel.

00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of today’s text saying,
“Tabitha, rise,”

00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like you to put the name of a person

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:17.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you really want to see come back
in the resurrection

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:20.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
alive once more and hear Jesus say,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(Your mother’s name), rise.”

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:25.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(Your father), rise.”

00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:30.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(Your beloved husband or wife), rise.”

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our text for today may only be two words.

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:36.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what hope and courage they give us!
