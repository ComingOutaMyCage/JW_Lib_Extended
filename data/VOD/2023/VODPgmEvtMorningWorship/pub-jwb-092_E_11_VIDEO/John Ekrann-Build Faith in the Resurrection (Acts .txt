00:00:01 With these two words for our text today,
00:00:04 Jehovah brought Tabitha, or Dorcas,
00:00:06 back to life.
00:00:08 And as our commentators also pointed out,
00:00:11 the resurrection of the dead has to be
00:00:14 one of the most amazing miracles mentioned in the Bible.
00:00:17 The restoration of a human body,
00:00:20 or the formation of a new body,
00:00:22 and then the putting of the memories
00:00:25 and everything that was that person back into it
00:00:28 is just an amazing demonstration
00:00:31 of the power of chemistry and biology and physics
00:00:35 —what Jehovah understands about life and the universe—
00:00:38 in a way that is just amazing to us.
00:00:42 Of course, we’re amazed by modern technology,
00:00:45 maybe smartphones and computers and modern medicine,
00:00:49 but those things pale in comparison
00:00:52 when we think about the power and understanding
00:00:55 that it takes for Jehovah to resurrect a human being.
00:00:59 In fact, for many people,
00:01:01 the idea of the resurrection of the dead
00:01:04 really seems far-fetched
00:01:06 —maybe it’s the stuff of science fiction,
00:01:09 or maybe they may even think it is just wishful thinking.
00:01:13 So how can we build our faith and confidence in the resurrection
00:01:17 and help others to have faith and confidence
00:01:20 in this wonderful hope as well?
00:01:22 Well, we’ll discuss just a couple of ways.
00:01:24 First, we can reason it out by meditating
00:01:27 on Jehovah’s creative power and who he is.
00:01:32 Let’s consider a couple of examples of men
00:01:35 that reasoned that Jehovah must be capable of the resurrection,
00:01:40 even though there hadn’t been any resurrections up to that point.
00:01:43 Let’s consider Abraham.
00:01:45 If we look at Hebrews 11:19,
00:01:50 when Jehovah had asked him
00:01:52 to offer up Isaac, his son, as a sacrifice,
00:01:56 notice how he reasoned.
00:01:58 Hebrews 11:19:
00:02:00 “But he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead,
00:02:05 “and he did receive him from there
00:02:08 in an illustrative way.”
00:02:11 Yes, Abraham was able to reason on the fact that Jehovah was the Creator
00:02:15 and the fact that he had restored Sarah’s reproductive powers.
00:02:19 He had resurrected, basically, her ability to have children.
00:02:24 He concluded that even if he should
00:02:26 follow through with sacrificing Isaac,
00:02:31 that Jehovah could and would bring him back from the dead.
00:02:35 Well, that knowledge certainly would have strengthened him
00:02:38 and strengthened his resolve to do something
00:02:40 that must have been an extremely difficult thing to ask a father
00:02:44 —to put, basically, his son to death.
00:02:48 But that hope, that strength of resolve,
00:02:52 that he had was bolstered by the fact
00:02:55 that he understood Jehovah could bring him back from the dead.
00:02:57 He reasoned on it.
00:02:59 Or Job—he believed in the resurrection.
00:03:03 At Job 14:14, 15,
00:03:06 notice how Job reasons
00:03:09 on Jehovah’s capability.
00:03:12 Job 14:14, 15:
00:03:15 “If a man dies, can he live again?
00:03:19 “I will wait all the days of my compulsory service
00:03:21 “until my relief comes.
00:03:23 “You will call, and I will answer you.
00:03:27 You will long for the work of your hands.”
00:03:31 So we keep in mind
00:03:34 that Job wrote these words after the death of his ten children.
00:03:39 Now, the pain and suffering of having just one child die,
00:03:42 for parents, is really tragic.
00:03:45 But ten children
00:03:47 —that’s an unbelievable burden of grief.
00:03:50 But Job reasoned that if he, as their father,
00:03:55 missed his ten children so much,
00:03:58 he was sure that Jehovah also longed for them
00:04:01 and missed them as well.
00:04:04 Even though he had ten more children later,
00:04:07 we can be sure that Job was looking forward
00:04:09 to seeing his other dead, lost children
00:04:13 in the resurrection.
00:04:15 Now, that’s the first way of just reasoning on Jehovah’s capability
00:04:18 —knowing who he is and understanding
00:04:20 that he has the capability to perform resurrections.
00:04:24 The second way is reading accounts of actual resurrections in the Bible.
00:04:28 There were nine recorded resurrections in the Bible.
00:04:32 Elijah resurrected a child.
00:04:35 Elisha resurrected a child.
00:04:37 Elisha resurrected a man even after he was dead;
00:04:41 a man got thrown on his dead bones and got resurrected.
00:04:45 Jesus resurrected the widow of Nain’s son
00:04:49 and Jairus’ daughter,
00:04:51 and then also Jesus resurrected Lazarus.
00:04:54 And then we have Jehovah resurrecting Jesus.
00:04:58 And then we have Peter resurrecting Tabitha, or Dorcas, in our text for today.
00:05:02 And then we have Paul resurrecting young Eutychus.
00:05:06 Now, if we look at these resurrections, we learn several things from them.
00:05:10 Some children were resurrected
00:05:12 (which is certainly comforting for parents who’ve lost children)
00:05:16 and some older ones, like Tabitha and Lazarus.
00:05:20 One resurrection was done by dead bones.
00:05:22 The prophet wasn’t even there, so no one could claim he worked that one out.
00:05:27 So the purpose of the miracles of the resurrection recorded in the Bible
00:05:31 was to really build faith that Jehovah and Jesus
00:05:35 can and will perform resurrections.
00:05:38 I really like the way the apostle Paul says at Acts 17:31
00:05:43 that Jesus’ resurrection
00:05:46 “provided a guarantee to all men.”
00:05:50 It’s like by recording those resurrections in the Bible,
00:05:52 Jehovah is saying:
00:05:54 ‘I guarantee that I can do this.
00:05:57 Not only can you reason on it, but I’m demonstrating that I can do this.’
00:06:02 See, if death is really like the Pause button on a remote,
00:06:06 then the resurrection by Jehovah
00:06:08 is like him pressing the Play button
00:06:10 to resume their life.
00:06:13 So we can reason on the fact that Jehovah
00:06:16 has the creative ability and the ability
00:06:20 (like for Abraham and Job) to perform resurrections.
00:06:24 And we can read about the actual resurrections that Jehovah performed.
00:06:28 Both of these give us knowledge
00:06:31 and faith in the resurrection.
00:06:35 But how does knowledge and faith in the resurrection hope
00:06:37 actually help us today?
00:06:39 Well, knowledge gives us power and strength and courage.
00:06:44 To illustrate, one day as a young boy,
00:06:47 I was out in the field ministry and I was going up to a door
00:06:50 and this ferocious dog came from out of nowhere
00:06:53 —just teeth and all coming right at me— and I ran for my life.
00:06:57 And I got a little ways from him, and I hear this “thunk.”
00:07:02 And I realized, ‘Oh, that sounds like a chain.’
00:07:04 I turned around and, sure enough, he was chained right there.
00:07:08 He couldn’t go any further.
00:07:09 Well, now, with the knowledge that he was chained and couldn’t go any further,
00:07:13 I could walk semicourageously
00:07:16 up to the door and give my presentation.
00:07:20 See, Satan snarls; he barks; he threatens.
00:07:23 But in the end, Jehovah limits him,
00:07:26 like a strong chain, as to what he can do.
00:07:29 I mean, even if Satan succeeds in killing us
00:07:32 before the end of this system or if we die before the end of this old system,
00:07:37 Jehovah gives us the hope of the resurrection.
00:07:40 He lets us know that ferocious death
00:07:42 cannot cause us or our loved ones
00:07:46 any permanent harm.
00:07:48 Any harm caused by death is temporary.
00:07:52 It’s like that Pause on the remote,
00:07:54 and Jehovah can easily just press Play.
00:08:00 Today’s text is only two words,
00:08:02 but it has tremendous power.
00:08:05 I want you to try this and see how it makes you feel.
00:08:08 Instead of today’s text saying, “Tabitha, rise,”
00:08:11 I’d like you to put the name of a person
00:08:14 that you really want to see come back in the resurrection
00:08:17 alive once more and hear Jesus say,
00:08:20 “(Your mother’s name), rise.”
00:08:23 “(Your father), rise.”
00:08:25 “(Your beloved husband or wife), rise.”
00:08:30 Our text for today may only be two words.
00:08:33 But what hope and courage they give us!
