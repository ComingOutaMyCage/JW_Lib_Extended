00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:04.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, let us consider the question,

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:06.277 line:10% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah care

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
for those who are humble?

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:11.240 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, humility is a quality

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
that is part of our figurative heart.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.161 line:10% position:50% align:center
And just like other qualities of the heart

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:20.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like kindness, mildness, patience—

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility is a quality that we cannot see.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even so, have you ever said

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a brother or sister
in your congregation or here at Bethel

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that that brother or that sister
is so humble?

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what made you say that?

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see a little cloud
filled with humility

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
hovering above the brother or sister?

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but you must have seen something
that made you conclude

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a brother or sister is humble.

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what was that something?

00:00:56.827 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to answer, think of this comparison:

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine you walk into a store

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you see a display
of boxes with chocolate.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
The boxes look nice,

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you wonder
what is the quality of the chocolates.

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a store clerk gives you

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
a chocolate as a sample.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
You taste it.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm, that’s good!

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you know what is in the box.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the lesson of this little story?

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just like tasting a sample chocolate

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
reveals the quality
of the chocolate in the box,

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
so seeing an act of humility

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
reveals the depth of humility

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
in someone’s heart.

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, if we don’t prove

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
by words or by actions our humility,

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
no one will know that we have it.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when do we have opportunities

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give out samples, so to speak,

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our humility?

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Watchtower</i>  article
that is the source of today’s comments

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentions three situations

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:17.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may test
the depth and genuineness of our humility.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three situations are these:

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we receive counsel,

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
when others receive privileges of service,

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when we face new circumstances.

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, today’s comments focus

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the third situation.

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
They focus on the changes of assignments
that have been received

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a good number
of traveling overseers and their wives,

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:50.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethelites, brothers and sisters
in other forms of full-time service,

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as by coordinators
of the bodies of elders.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why can we say
that these brothers and sisters

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
offered a beautiful sample of their humility

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
by accepting their changes of assignment?

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:12.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer, note this quote
from the <i>Watchtower</i>  comments:

00:03:12.838 --> 00:03:15.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such adjustments were not easy

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for these brothers and sisters to make.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Obviously, they felt attached
to their former assignment,

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:26.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in many cases
one that they had cherished for years.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:30.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some went through a ‘grieving’ process

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they adjusted to their new circumstances.”

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:38.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A ‘grieving’ process”

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:41.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
—<i>The Watchtower</i> 
does not often use that expression.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the case
of those who were asked

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give up an assignment
that they dearly loved,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a proper expression to use.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though facing new circumstances
was difficult,

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:56.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
these brothers and sisters

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
who used to serve at Bethel
or in the traveling work

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepted the change with humility.

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did Jehovah help them?

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we find an answer at Isaiah 57:15,

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:14.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the text for today.

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the beginning of the verse,
Isaiah is speaking.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:21.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says about Jehovah:

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:25.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this is what
the High and Lofty One says,

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
who lives forever
and whose name is [Jehovah].”

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:34.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, then Jehovah begins to speak.

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
He confirms what Isaiah said
but adds a surprising thought to it.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:42.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says: “I reside

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:45.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the high and holy place,

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but also with those crushed

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lowly in spirit.”

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:54.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s pause here for a moment.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:58.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Bible reference work says
that the verb “reside,” or “dwell,”

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in the beginning
of the sentence

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:04.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
is implied in the second part
of the sentence.

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:08.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we could read the sentence as follows:

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:12.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I reside in the high and holy place,

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but I also reside

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:18.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those crushed and lowly in spirit.’

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about this statement
made by Jehovah.

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:25.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it not amazing and heartwarming?

00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the combination of qualities
that he expresses.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is “high” and “holy”

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:35.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also nearby and humble.

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is mighty and powerful

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also attentive and tender

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his feelings with lowly ones.

00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:44.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, also note this:

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not say,
‘I see those who are lowly.’

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:54.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not say,
‘I hear those who are lowly.’

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he said:
‘I reside with those who are lowly.’

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:04.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to understand this verse better,
let us consider a few questions.

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:09.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, what is the meaning of “reside”?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one Bible dictionary defines
the Hebrew word translated “reside”

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:17.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “settle down.”

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:19.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what comes to your mind

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:23.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you hear the expression “settle down”?

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:27.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the word make you think of a visitor
who rushes in and leaves quickly?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, it makes us think of a visitor

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
who settles in an easy chair,

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:39.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
leans back,
and takes his time to stay with us.

00:06:39.044 --> 00:06:43.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jehovah’s case, he resides,
or settles down for a visit, with us

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of his holy spirit.

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:49.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another question:

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:52.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do when he resides with us?

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, note the last part of the verse.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you see another word
that is mentioned two times.

00:06:58.105 --> 00:07:00.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read:

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:03.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To revive the spirit of the lowly

00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to revive the heart

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:09.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those being crushed.”

00:07:10.284 --> 00:07:12.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, “to revive” means

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:16.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
to raise from discouragement and depression.

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:18.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, in this precious scripture,

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:21.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises that he will take his time

00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:24.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be with his humble servants

00:07:24.006 --> 00:07:27.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are discouraged or even crushed.

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why does Jehovah reside with us
when we are discouraged?

00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:38.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us to regain the inner peace
and the inner strength that we need

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal with challenging circumstances

00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:45.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to continue serving Jehovah with joy.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that is the way

00:07:47.112 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which Jehovah cares
for all his humble servants,

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is also the way
in which Jehovah helped

00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:56.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:59.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
who humbly accepted a change of assignment.

00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gently helped them

00:08:02.127 --> 00:08:05.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let their feelings of sadness fade away

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:10.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to embrace the joys
that were waiting in their new assignment.

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:14.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one couple who received a new assignment

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:16.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
related how an illustration

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped them to keep in mind
what had changed

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:22.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what had not changed.

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:25.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
The couple said:

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We think of a parent and children.

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:30.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A parent may decide to move a child

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:33.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from one bedroom
to another room in the house,

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:35.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the child still lives in the same house

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:38.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and receives the same love and care
from the parent.”

00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:42.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the couple added:

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:46.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Likewise, Jehovah may decide
to move his servants

00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:49.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from one form of full-time service
to another one,

00:08:49.674 --> 00:08:53.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they still live in the same house,
so to speak,

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:57.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
and receive the same love and protection
from Jehovah.”

00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:01.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, as that couple observed,

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:04.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
our assignments may change,

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:07.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the love that we receive from Jehovah

00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:09.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not change.

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:12.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when we show humility,

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:16.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s warm feelings toward us

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
are bound to increase.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did we consider?

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cares for all his servants
who are humble.

00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:32.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we observe
that we are overwhelmed with sadness,

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:37.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will reside with us
in order to revive us.

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:42.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters
who humbly accepted a change of assignment

00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:44.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
experience how Jehovah helped them

00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:49.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome
their initial feelings of disappointment.
