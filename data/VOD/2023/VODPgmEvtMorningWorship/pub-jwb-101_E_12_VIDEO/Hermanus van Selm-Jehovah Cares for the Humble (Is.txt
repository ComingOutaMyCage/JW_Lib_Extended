00:00:01 Now, let us consider the question,
00:00:04 How does Jehovah care
00:00:06 for those who are humble?
00:00:09 Now, humility is a quality
00:00:11 that is part of our figurative heart.
00:00:13 And just like other qualities of the heart
00:00:16 —like kindness, mildness, patience—
00:00:20 humility is a quality that we cannot see.
00:00:26 Even so, have you ever said
00:00:28 about a brother or sister in your congregation or here at Bethel
00:00:33 that that brother or that sister is so humble?
00:00:38 Now, what made you say that?
00:00:42 Did you see a little cloud filled with humility
00:00:45 hovering above the brother or sister?
00:00:47 No, but you must have seen something that made you conclude
00:00:51 that a brother or sister is humble.
00:00:53 So, what was that something?
00:00:56 Now, to answer, think of this comparison:
00:01:00 Imagine you walk into a store
00:01:03 and you see a display of boxes with chocolate.
00:01:08 The boxes look nice,
00:01:09 but you wonder what is the quality of the chocolates.
00:01:13 Then a store clerk gives you
00:01:16 a chocolate as a sample.
00:01:19 You taste it.
00:01:20 Mm, that’s good!
00:01:22 Now you know what is in the box.
00:01:25 So, what is the lesson of this little story?
00:01:29 Well, just like tasting a sample chocolate
00:01:34 reveals the quality of the chocolate in the box,
00:01:38 so seeing an act of humility
00:01:42 reveals the depth of humility
00:01:45 in someone’s heart.
00:01:47 After all, if we don’t prove
00:01:50 by words or by actions our humility,
00:01:54 no one will know that we have it.
00:01:57 So when do we have opportunities
00:02:01 to give out samples, so to speak,
00:02:04 of our humility?
00:02:07 Now, the Watchtower  article that is the source of today’s comments
00:02:11 mentions three situations
00:02:13 that may test the depth and genuineness of our humility.
00:02:18 The three situations are these:
00:02:21 when we receive counsel,
00:02:23 when others receive privileges of service,
00:02:27 or when we face new circumstances.
00:02:32 Now, today’s comments focus
00:02:35 on the third situation.
00:02:38 They focus on the changes of assignments that have been received
00:02:41 by a good number of traveling overseers and their wives,
00:02:45 Bethelites, brothers and sisters in other forms of full-time service,
00:02:50 as well as by coordinators of the bodies of elders.
00:02:55 Now, why can we say that these brothers and sisters
00:02:59 offered a beautiful sample of their humility
00:03:03 by accepting their changes of assignment?
00:03:08 To answer, note this quote from the Watchtower  comments:
00:03:12 “Such adjustments were not easy
00:03:15 “for these brothers and sisters to make.
00:03:18 “Obviously, they felt attached to their former assignment,
00:03:21 “in many cases one that they had cherished for years.
00:03:26 “Some went through a ‘grieving’ process
00:03:30 as they adjusted to their new circumstances.”
00:03:35 “A ‘grieving’ process”
00:03:38 —The Watchtower  does not often use that expression.
00:03:41 But in the case of those who were asked
00:03:44 to give up an assignment that they dearly loved,
00:03:47 it is a proper expression to use.
00:03:51 Though facing new circumstances was difficult,
00:03:54 these brothers and sisters
00:03:56 who used to serve at Bethel or in the traveling work
00:03:59 accepted the change with humility.
00:04:04 Now, how did Jehovah help them?
00:04:07 Well, we find an answer at Isaiah 57:15,
00:04:12 which is the text for today.
00:04:14 Now, in the beginning of the verse, Isaiah is speaking.
00:04:18 He says about Jehovah:
00:04:21 “For this is what the High and Lofty One says,
00:04:25 who lives forever and whose name is [Jehovah].”
00:04:30 Now, then Jehovah begins to speak.
00:04:34 He confirms what Isaiah said but adds a surprising thought to it.
00:04:38 Jehovah says: “I reside
00:04:42 “in the high and holy place,
00:04:45 “but also with those crushed
00:04:48 and lowly in spirit.”
00:04:51 Now, let’s pause here for a moment.
00:04:54 One Bible reference work says that the verb “reside,” or “dwell,”
00:04:58 mentioned in the beginning of the sentence
00:05:01 is implied in the second part of the sentence.
00:05:04 So we could read the sentence as follows:
00:05:08 ‘I reside in the high and holy place,
00:05:12 ‘but I also reside
00:05:14 with those crushed and lowly in spirit.’
00:05:18 Now, think about this statement made by Jehovah.
00:05:21 Is it not amazing and heartwarming?
00:05:25 Note the combination of qualities that he expresses.
00:05:29 He is “high” and “holy”
00:05:32 but also nearby and humble.
00:05:35 He is mighty and powerful
00:05:37 but also attentive and tender
00:05:40 in his feelings with lowly ones.
00:05:42 Now, also note this:
00:05:44 Jehovah did not say, ‘I see those who are lowly.’
00:05:50 He did not say, ‘I hear those who are lowly.’
00:05:54 But he said: ‘I reside with those who are lowly.’
00:06:00 Now, to understand this verse better, let us consider a few questions.
00:06:04 First, what is the meaning of “reside”?
00:06:09 Well, one Bible dictionary defines the Hebrew word translated “reside”
00:06:13 as “settle down.”
00:06:17 Now, what comes to your mind
00:06:19 when you hear the expression “settle down”?
00:06:23 Does the word make you think of a visitor who rushes in and leaves quickly?
00:06:27 No.
00:06:28 Instead, it makes us think of a visitor
00:06:31 who settles in an easy chair,
00:06:34 leans back, and takes his time to stay with us.
00:06:39 In Jehovah’s case, he resides, or settles down for a visit, with us
00:06:43 by means of his holy spirit.
00:06:47 Another question:
00:06:49 What does Jehovah do when he resides with us?
00:06:52 Now, note the last part of the verse.
00:06:55 There you see another word that is mentioned two times.
00:06:58 We read:
00:07:00 “To revive the spirit of the lowly
00:07:03 “and to revive the heart
00:07:06 of those being crushed.”
00:07:10 Now, “to revive” means
00:07:12 to raise from discouragement and depression.
00:07:16 Thus, in this precious scripture,
00:07:18 Jehovah promises that he will take his time
00:07:21 to be with his humble servants
00:07:24 who are discouraged or even crushed.
00:07:29 And why does Jehovah reside with us when we are discouraged?
00:07:33 To help us to regain the inner peace and the inner strength that we need
00:07:38 to deal with challenging circumstances
00:07:41 and to continue serving Jehovah with joy.
00:07:45 Now, that is the way
00:07:47 in which Jehovah cares for all his humble servants,
00:07:50 and that is also the way in which Jehovah helped
00:07:54 our brothers and sisters
00:07:56 who humbly accepted a change of assignment.
00:07:59 Jehovah gently helped them
00:08:02 to let their feelings of sadness fade away
00:08:05 and to embrace the joys that were waiting in their new assignment.
00:08:11 Now, one couple who received a new assignment
00:08:14 related how an illustration
00:08:16 helped them to keep in mind what had changed
00:08:19 and what had not changed.
00:08:22 The couple said:
00:08:25 “We think of a parent and children.
00:08:28 “A parent may decide to move a child
00:08:30 “from one bedroom to another room in the house,
00:08:33 “but the child still lives in the same house
00:08:35 and receives the same love and care from the parent.”
00:08:39 And then the couple added:
00:08:42 “Likewise, Jehovah may decide to move his servants
00:08:46 “from one form of full-time service to another one,
00:08:49 “but they still live in the same house, so to speak,
00:08:53 and receive the same love and protection from Jehovah.”
00:08:58 Indeed, as that couple observed,
00:09:01 our assignments may change,
00:09:04 but the love that we receive from Jehovah
00:09:07 does not change.
00:09:09 In fact, when we show humility,
00:09:12 Jehovah’s warm feelings toward us
00:09:16 are bound to increase.
00:09:20 So, what did we consider?
00:09:23 Jehovah cares for all his servants who are humble.
00:09:28 When we observe that we are overwhelmed with sadness,
00:09:32 Jehovah will reside with us in order to revive us.
00:09:38 Our brothers and sisters who humbly accepted a change of assignment
00:09:42 experience how Jehovah helped them
00:09:44 to overcome their initial feelings of disappointment.
