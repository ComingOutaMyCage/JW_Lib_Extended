00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:05.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at Matthew 11:29 in its entirety.

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:07.991 line:10% position:50% align:center
It comes after Jesus made

00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:12.095 line:10% position:50% align:center
a rather profound statement in verse 27.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:13.930 line:10% position:50% align:center
Do you have that?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.734 line:10% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 11:27, Jesus said:

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All things have been handed over to me
by my Father,

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:24.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and no one fully knows the Son
except the Father;

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither does anyone fully know the Father

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“except the Son [but then he adds]

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
and anyone to whom the Son
is willing to reveal him.”

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that profound?

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part of Jesus’ mission in coming to the earth

00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to more clearly reveal

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:47.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s thinking and personality.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with that thought in mind,
let’s read verse 29:

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:59.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart,

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will find
refreshment for yourselves.”

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:05.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 30 adds the detail:

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For my yoke is kindly,
and my load is light.”

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we all know what it means

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:15.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being “mild-tempered.”

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about “lowly in heart”?

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:20.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our study note explains that

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:24.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means “humble and unpretentious.”

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what can we glean

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:31.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we magnify

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:33.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 29?

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s start with the yoke.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a neck yoke depicted on-screen,

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:43.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think we can often picture
two animals yoked together.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case, it’s a head yoke.

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:51.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the look on the cattle’s faces,
they don’t seem particularly thrilled

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be yoked together like that.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it allows them
to unitedly pull in the same direction

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accomplish a common task.

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jesus said in verse 30:

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:06.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My yoke is kindly.”

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some farmers
kindly padded the yoke for that purpose.

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ yoke is comfortable for us.

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you notice in the verse he said:

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take my yoke”?

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we to understand from that?

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>Insight </i> offers two possibilities.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is that if Jesus’ yoke

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
is one that Jehovah places on Jesus,

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:39.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
then that signifies that others
can get under the yoke with Jesus,

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:41.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll assist them.

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:44.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the second possibility

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that if Jesus’ yoke
refers to one that Jesus puts on us,

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:51.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the reference is that we submit

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:56.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his authority and direction
as his disciples.

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:58.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
The September 2019 <i>Watchtower</i>

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
alludes to those same two possibilities.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the yoke is an illustration.

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:08.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our publications have applied it

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:10.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jesus putting his yoke on us.

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s extend the illustration a little.

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Farmers often trained their oxen

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
to respond to verbal commands

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could keep
their hands on the plow

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
and did not have to deal
with the reins and the plow.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
could be likened to the voice of Jesus,

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
the head of the congregation.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:37.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we willingly submit
to the faithful slave,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re ultimately submitting

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jesus’ authority and direction.

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:47.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that nicely harmonizes
with Matthew 28:18-20.

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
You recall that Jesus had

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
considerable authority

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a human on earth.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
But looking at the context of Matthew 28:18,

00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:05.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words here were spoken
after he was resurrected to spirit life.

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:09.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he had not yet ascended to his Father,

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:12.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since Jehovah spoke to him as a human,

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:16.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely he communicated with Jesus

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
immediately after his resurrection

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that was
the ultimate sacrifice for mankind.

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, the resurrected Jesus

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:29.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
says at Matthew 28:18:

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All authority [all authority]

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:36.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been given me
in heaven and on the earth.”

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:40.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, back to Matthew 11:29,

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that if we take that yoke,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
we “will find refreshment for [ourselves].”

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds wonderful
—doesn’t it?—

00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:56.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
relaxing, luxurious, sweet refreshment.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:00.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not the intent.

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:04.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
A yoke does not represent a vacation.

00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:09.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
A yoke in and of itself implies work.

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:11.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
A farmer does not put cattle in a yoke

00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:15.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and send them out to graze
in a refreshing pasture.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:20.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
He puts them in a yoke to accomplish work.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus now has authority in heaven.

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the resurrected
anointed ones’ refreshment

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:32.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not mean floating on a cloud
and strumming a harp,

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Christendom sometimes suggests.

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ personality
did not change when he went to heaven.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a yoke refers to meaningful work.

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:46.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus is mild-tempered.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that work is kindly and refreshing.

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:53.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just think of the near future.

00:05:54.404 --> 00:05:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to imagine all of the anointed

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
following Jesus’ direction at Armageddon.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re going to assist
in dismantling Satan’s entire wicked system.

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:08.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is work.

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:11.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since it’s under Jesus’ direction,

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:13.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
that work is refreshing.

00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:15.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s invigorating.
It’s fulfilling.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for those of us on earth,

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
refreshment does not mean
lounging in our favorite easy chair

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the beverage of our choice.

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have work to do.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the yoke is padded.
It’s kindly.

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t chafe under it.

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:36.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is mild-tempered.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now go back to Matthew 11:29.

00:06:38.548 --> 00:06:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you notice, Jesus said:
“And learn from me.”

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did he include those words?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sentence would have made
perfect sense without them.

00:06:47.723 --> 00:06:51.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he specifically said:
“And learn from me.”

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:54.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why might that be significant?

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what about contrast?

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who had Jesus’ followers
learned from all their lives?

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the religious leaders of the day.

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a contrast
between their attitude and personality

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
when compared with Jesus!

00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go to Matthew chapter 23, please.

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
His disciples had learned
from the scribes and Pharisees,

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:21.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so they had picked up flaws

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their attitude and personality.

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:26.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read Matthew 23:4,

00:07:26.562 --> 00:07:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
please allow Matthew 11:30
to be ringing in your ear.

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:31.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall?

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:34.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “My load is light.”

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:37.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what had
the disciples learned previously

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the religious leaders?

00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:40.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 23:4:

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:45.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They bind up [not light but] heavy loads

00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:47.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put them on the shoulders of men.”

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you glance at verse 5,

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see that they like
to piously “be seen by men.”

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:57.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
They liked the most prominent seats
and meals in the synagogue.

00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:00.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now in verse 11

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
(learn from Jesus),

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “But the greatest one among you
must be your minister.”

00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:13.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember an entrenched personality
flaw of the apostles?

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often defaulted into arguing

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
about who was the greatest one among them.

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:23.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
They likely learned that
from the religious leaders’ poor example.

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:27.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it makes sense in our text today
that Jesus pleaded:

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Learn from me.”

00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, he said, ‘I am different; learn.’

00:08:32.295 --> 00:08:35.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.”

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:40.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the yoke of Jesus
does definitely include disciple-making,

00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:43.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to learn from Jesus

00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all aspects of Christian discipleship.

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:49.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:21 says:

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:52.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He left a model
for us to follow his steps closely.’

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:56.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
That verse, the context,
does not talk about the preaching work.

00:08:56.152 --> 00:09:00.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s talking about dealing with suffering
and interpersonal relationships.

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:02.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, 1 Peter 3:1 says:

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the same way [as the model], you wives,

00:09:05.328 --> 00:09:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
be in subjection to your husbands.”

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 3:7 says:

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘In the same way, husbands, treat your wife.’

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 3 and verse 8,

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s addressed to all of us
interacting with one another.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has four beautiful Christlike qualities
that we need to display with one another.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:27.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true that because of imperfection

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:29.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and misunderstandings,

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all make mistakes.

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the baseline is

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn from Jesus,

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:43.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the fact that he was mild-tempered

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lowly in heart.
