00:00:01 Some secular authorities
00:00:03 have drawn wrong conclusions
00:00:05 about the involvement
00:00:07 of the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:10 when an individual commits a serious wrong
00:00:14 that violates both civil law
00:00:17 and Scriptural law.
00:00:19 Part of the misunderstanding
00:00:21 involves our use of the term “judicial committee.”
00:00:26 Now, some erroneously conclude
00:00:29 that the congregation is trying to take over
00:00:32 the work of the police or the judicial courts,
00:00:35 and that’s simply not the case,
00:00:37 as explained in the May 2019 Watchtower,  page 7,
00:00:42 which our comments are taken from here today.
00:00:45 So let’s briefly review the history
00:00:48 of handling judicial matters among God’s people.
00:00:52 Now, I’d like to do so under this theme:
00:00:55 “The Older Men and the Superior Authorities
00:00:59 Standing in Their Proper Place.”
00:01:03 Now, it is important to remember
00:01:05 that Jehovah has always and will always be
00:01:10 “the Judge [over] all the earth.”
00:01:12 That’s according to Genesis 18:25.
00:01:15 But how Jehovah has his judgment determined
00:01:20 and the punishment administered
00:01:22 has changed over a period of time
00:01:24 —whom he allows to do that.
00:01:26 At first, of course, he was the Judge.
00:01:28 You take Adam and Eve —He made the decision.
00:01:32 It was a swift action.
00:01:34 He pronounced the sentence
00:01:36 and moved them right out of the garden of Eden immediately.
00:01:39 But Jehovah God has never abdicated
00:01:42 his authority as the universal Judge.
00:01:45 But as time has gone on and the human family has grown,
00:01:49 then he’s delegated judicial authority to others.
00:01:53 The first were the patriarchs,
00:01:56 and they would handle matters within their own family units.
00:02:01 And then later, Israel started to grow.
00:02:04 There were hundreds of thousands,
00:02:05 and so older men were appointed
00:02:08 to handle matters within the nation.
00:02:11 But remember at one time they were also in Egypt
00:02:15 and they were in captivity as slaves,
00:02:18 so this group of older men would have limits
00:02:21 on their judicial authority.
00:02:24 But that limit was about to change
00:02:27 because the Israelites left the Egyptian bondage
00:02:31 in Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.E.
00:02:35 And about a year later,
00:02:37 they went into a covenant with Jehovah God called the Law covenant.
00:02:41 So Jehovah gave laws
00:02:43 that would include all the aspects of their life.
00:02:47 Now, sometime later, notice what Jehovah said to Moses.
00:02:51 I’m going to Numbers 11:16
00:02:56 —Numbers 11:16.
00:02:59 “Jehovah replied to Moses:
00:03:00 “‘Gather for me 70 men from the elders of Israel,
00:03:05 “‘men whom you recognize as elders
00:03:08 and officials of the people.’”
00:03:10 So these 70 men, chosen from all of the elders,
00:03:15 were special officers.
00:03:18 So think about it now,
00:03:20 Israel had a national law,
00:03:24 and now they had an arrangement of older men
00:03:26 who could enforce the Law.
00:03:29 This was a sovereign nation under Jehovah God.
00:03:33 So all aspects
00:03:34 —spiritual, civil, criminal wrongdoing—
00:03:39 were all handled by the older men.
00:03:42 They would hear the matter,
00:03:44 they would render judgment,
00:03:46 they would assist the victim,
00:03:48 and they would administer appropriate discipline.
00:03:52 But in time, the nomadic Israelites
00:03:54 then took over the Promised Land,
00:03:57 and they went back to dwelling in fixed homes,
00:04:01 and they then had communities.
00:04:03 But these were special boundaries
00:04:05 where Jehovah’s Law was the law of the land.
00:04:10 The older men became responsible for handling it on a community level.
00:04:15 They acted as judges,
00:04:17 they would administer justice,
00:04:19 they made sure there was good order, they maintained peace,
00:04:22 and they also handled the spiritual needs of the community.
00:04:27 Now, this was Israel’s judicial system
00:04:30 for 900 years,
00:04:33 from 1513 B.C.E.
00:04:36 to 607 B.C.E. when Jerusalem was destroyed.
00:04:40 This was a unique period
00:04:42 in the time of God’s people.
00:04:45 It was the only time when God’s people as a nation
00:04:49 were in complete control
00:04:52 of their entire judicial process.
00:04:56 During this time, only Jehovah’s Law was applied
00:05:00 within Israel’s fixed boundaries.
00:05:04 But notice the change that happened
00:05:06 when the Babylonians took over and conquered Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.
00:05:11 We’ll go to Deuteronomy chapter 28
00:05:16 and verse 64.
00:05:20 It says: “Jehovah will scatter you among all the nations,
00:05:24 from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth.”
00:05:27 And that’s exactly what happened.
00:05:30 They no longer were going to be in Israel.
00:05:33 They would be in communities far away from Israel.
00:05:36 Under the Persian rule,
00:05:38 they were scattered in 127 districts.
00:05:40 Under the Greek rule,
00:05:42 Alexander the Great brought many of the Jews
00:05:46 to his new city, Alexandria.
00:05:48 Under the Roman rule,
00:05:50 they allowed Jewish communities
00:05:53 within their cities throughout their empire.
00:05:57 So though these older men lived in these communities, see,
00:06:00 the local laws would be enforced
00:06:03 by the local secular authorities.
00:06:06 And that’s according to what the apostle Paul said at Romans 13:1.
00:06:11 Those were the “superior authorities”
00:06:14 that he made reference to.
00:06:16 So here’s the question,
00:06:18 When the Christian congregation was established,
00:06:22 would the entire judicial process,
00:06:25 both civil and Scriptural,
00:06:28 once again be handled by the older men in the congregation?
00:06:33 Well, the answer is no
00:06:35 —and for a good reason.
00:06:37 Now, it’s true, the global brotherhood
00:06:41 would all be unified under one Scriptural law,
00:06:45 and that Scriptural law would be applied in every congregation
00:06:49 no matter what land or what country they were in.
00:06:54 But what about the secular laws
00:06:56 governing civil and criminal matters?
00:07:00 Well, unlike the Scriptural law,
00:07:02 secular laws are specific
00:07:05 to the land that they govern.
00:07:08 For instance, the secular authorities’ definitions of crimes
00:07:13 and their enforcement of penalties are not consistent from land to land.
00:07:17 Take this example, substance abuse.
00:07:20 Well, what constitutes illegal abuse?
00:07:23 What’s the quantity consumed that would make it illegal?
00:07:27 If you’re driving some vehicle and you’re under the influence,
00:07:32 what’s the punishment —if there is any punishment?
00:07:35 You see, the answers to those questions
00:07:37 really vary widely from country to country,
00:07:40 in fact, even from state to state at times.
00:07:43 So it’s up to the secular governments
00:07:46 to determine the penalties and to enforce them.
00:07:50 So, in conclusion, Jehovah allows the superior authorities
00:07:54 —the governments, as it were—
00:07:56 to prosecute and administer
00:07:59 civil and criminal law.
00:08:02 Now, the authorities are vested
00:08:04 with the power to punish those who violate those laws.
00:08:08 That too is in accord with Romans chapter 13.
00:08:12 The Christian congregation is not —and never has been—
00:08:17 a substitute for the secular authorities,
00:08:20 and that’s why the congregation does not shield individuals
00:08:25 from this secular arrangement.
00:08:28 Now, it’s true, if a member of the congregation
00:08:31 commits a sin that is also a crime
00:08:35 in the eyes of the secular law,
00:08:38 then of course the secular law will handle that
00:08:41 but Jehovah allows the congregation elders
00:08:44 to handle the spiritual, or Scriptural,
00:08:49 aspect of the sin.
00:08:51 And this would then assure
00:08:53 that His name and His reputation are upheld
00:08:57 and that the parties themselves are able to be helped spiritually.
00:09:02 So in this way, prior to the new world of righteousness,
00:09:07 the Judge of all the earth
00:09:09 uses the older men and the superior authorities,
00:09:13 both standing in their proper place,
00:09:17 to accomplish His will.
