00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:03.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some secular authorities

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:05.388 line:10% position:50% align:center
have drawn wrong conclusions

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.023 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the involvement

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:10.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:14.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
when an individual commits a serious wrong

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:17.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
that violates both civil law

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Scriptural law.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:21.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part of the misunderstanding

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves our use
of the term “judicial committee.”

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:29.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some erroneously conclude

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:32.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the congregation is trying to take over

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work of the police
or the judicial courts,

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s simply not the case,

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:42.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
as explained
in the May 2019 <i>Watchtower, </i> page 7,

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:45.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
which our comments
are taken from here today.

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s briefly review the history

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
of handling judicial matters
among God’s people.

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’d like to do so under this theme:

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:59.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Older Men and the Superior Authorities

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Standing in Their Proper Place.”

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it is important to remember

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:10.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has always and will always be

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Judge [over] all the earth.”

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s according to Genesis 18:25.

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:20.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how Jehovah
has his judgment determined

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the punishment administered

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:24.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
has changed over a period of time

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
—whom he allows to do that.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, of course, he was the Judge.

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take Adam and Eve
—He made the decision.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a swift action.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
He pronounced the sentence

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and moved them right out
of the garden of Eden immediately.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah God has never abdicated

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
his authority as the universal Judge.

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:49.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as time has gone on
and the human family has grown,

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he’s delegated
judicial authority to others.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first were the patriarchs,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they would handle matters
within their own family units.

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:04.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then later, Israel started to grow.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were hundreds of thousands,

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:08.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so older men were appointed

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:11.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
to handle matters within the nation.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember at one time
they were also in Egypt

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were in captivity as slaves,

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:21.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
so this group of older men would have limits

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their judicial authority.

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that limit was about to change

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:31.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Israelites
left the Egyptian bondage

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:35.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.E.

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:37.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
And about a year later,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
they went into a covenant with Jehovah God
called the Law covenant.

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:43.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah gave laws

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would include
all the aspects of their life.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometime later,
notice what Jehovah said to Moses.

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:55.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to Numbers 11:16

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Numbers 11:16.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah replied to Moses:

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:05.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Gather for me 70 men
from the elders of Israel,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘men whom you recognize as elders

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and officials of the people.’”

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:15.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these 70 men,
chosen from all of the elders,

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:18.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
were special officers.

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:20.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
So think about it now,

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:24.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel had a national law,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now they had
an arrangement of older men

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could enforce the Law.

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a sovereign nation
under Jehovah God.

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all aspects

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:39.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
—spiritual, civil, criminal wrongdoing—

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
were all handled by the older men.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would hear the matter,

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would render judgment,

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would assist the victim,

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:52.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they would administer
appropriate discipline.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in time, the nomadic Israelites

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
then took over the Promised Land,

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:01.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they went back
to dwelling in fixed homes,

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:03.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they then had communities.

00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:05.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these were special boundaries

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:10.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s Law was the law of the land.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
The older men became responsible
for handling it on a community level.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
They acted as judges,

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would administer justice,

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:22.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
they made sure there was good order,
they maintained peace,

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they also handled
the spiritual needs of the community.

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was Israel’s judicial system

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 900 years,

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:36.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 1513 B.C.E.

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:40.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 607 B.C.E.
when Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a unique period

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the time of God’s people.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the only time
when God’s people as a nation

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in complete control

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
of their entire judicial process.

00:04:56.112 --> 00:05:00.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this time,
only Jehovah’s Law was applied

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:04.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
within Israel’s fixed boundaries.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice the change that happened

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:11.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Babylonians took over
and conquered Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll go to Deuteronomy chapter 28

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 64.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Jehovah will scatter you
among all the nations,

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the one end of the earth
to the other end of the earth.”

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what happened.

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
They no longer were going to be in Israel.

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would be in communities
far away from Israel.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the Persian rule,

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were scattered in 127 districts.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the Greek rule,

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:46.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alexander the Great brought many of the Jews

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his new city, Alexandria.

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the Roman rule,

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
they allowed Jewish communities

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
within their cities throughout their empire.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So though these older men
lived in these communities, see,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
the local laws would be enforced

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:06.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the local secular authorities.

00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:11.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s according
to what the apostle Paul said at Romans 13:1.

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:14.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were the “superior authorities”

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he made reference to.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:18.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the question,

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Christian congregation
was established,

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
would the entire judicial process,

00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
both civil and Scriptural,

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:33.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
once again be handled
by the older men in the congregation?

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer is no

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and for a good reason.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true, the global brotherhood

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:45.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
would all be unified
under one Scriptural law,

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Scriptural law
would be applied in every congregation

00:06:49.592 --> 00:06:53.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what land
or what country they were in.

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:56.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the secular laws

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
governing civil and criminal matters?

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, unlike the Scriptural law,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
secular laws are specific

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:08.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the land that they govern.

00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:13.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, the secular authorities’
definitions of crimes

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:17.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their enforcement of penalties
are not consistent from land to land.

00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take this example, substance abuse.

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what constitutes illegal abuse?

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:27.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the quantity consumed
that would make it illegal?

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re driving some vehicle
and you’re under the influence,

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:35.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the punishment
—if there is any punishment?

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the answers to those questions

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
really vary widely from country to country,

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:43.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
in fact, even from state to state at times.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s up to the secular governments

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:50.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
to determine the penalties
and to enforce them.

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:54.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, in conclusion,
Jehovah allows the superior authorities

00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the governments, as it were—

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prosecute and administer

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
civil and criminal law.

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:04.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the authorities are vested

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:08.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the power to punish
those who violate those laws.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
That too is in accord with Romans chapter 13.

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:17.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Christian congregation is not
—and never has been—

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
a substitute for the secular authorities,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why the congregation
does not shield individuals

00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:28.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this secular arrangement.

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:31.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true,
if a member of the congregation

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:35.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
commits a sin that is also a crime

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the eyes of the secular law,

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
then of course
the secular law will handle that

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah allows the congregation elders

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:49.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
to handle the spiritual, or Scriptural,

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:51.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
aspect of the sin.

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:53.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this would then assure

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:57.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
that His name and His reputation
are upheld

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the parties themselves
are able to be helped spiritually.

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in this way,
prior to the new world of righteousness,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Judge of all the earth

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:13.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
uses the older men
and the superior authorities,

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:17.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
both standing in their proper place,

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:19.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish His will.
