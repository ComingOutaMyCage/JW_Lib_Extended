00:00:02 What can we learn about generosity and trust
00:00:06 from Jehovah’s use of the holy spirit?
00:00:09 First, let’s consider generosity.
00:00:12 If you had a monopoly
00:00:14 on all the energy and fuel in the universe,
00:00:18 would you distribute it freely and generously
00:00:21 or would you charge the highest price possible for it by the gallon?
00:00:26 Well, what example does our Father set
00:00:28 when it comes to providing his holy spirit?
00:00:33 Please note the inspired words of the apostle John at John chapter 3,
00:00:38 and notice with me, please, verse 34.
00:00:42 At John 3:34, there it says:
00:00:44 “For the one whom God sent speaks the sayings of God,
00:00:48 for He [Jehovah] does not give the spirit sparingly.”
00:00:54 Now, The New American Bible  says here:
00:00:56 “He does not ration his gift of the Spirit.”
00:01:00 Can you think of Bible examples from the Hebrew Scriptures
00:01:04 when Jehovah gave his holy spirit generously?
00:01:07 Bezalel was filled with the power of God.
00:01:11 Joshua “was full of the spirit of wisdom.”
00:01:14 Jehovah’s spirit empowered Samson.
00:01:18 What about in the Greek Scriptures?
00:01:21 Well, John the Baptizer was filled with holy spirit even before birth.
00:01:25 And then there was the anointing of Jesus’ disciples with holy spirit
00:01:29 on Pentecost 33 C.E.,
00:01:32 which is referred to in today’s text.
00:01:35 Acts 2:4 says that those disciples
00:01:37 “all became filled with holy spirit
00:01:40 and started to speak in different languages.”
00:01:43 Of course, Jehovah uses his holy spirit
00:01:46 to accomplish different things in harmony with his purpose,
00:01:50 but there is no doubt that he provides it generously.
00:01:54 Well, what about in our day?
00:01:57 Jesus’ words reveal one of the ways that holy spirit is used in our behalf.
00:02:02 If you’re still there in the book of John,
00:02:05 notice Jesus’ words at John 14:16, 17.
00:02:11 He said: “And I will ask the Father
00:02:13 “and he will give you another helper
00:02:16 to be with you forever, the spirit of the truth.”
00:02:21 The study note for John 14:16 says
00:02:24 that the word “helper” could also mean “comforter;
00:02:28 encourager; advocate.”
00:02:31 Well, how can holy spirit be a comforter?
00:02:34 Verse 26 mentions
00:02:36 “the helper, the holy spirit, . . .
00:02:39 “that one will teach you all things
00:02:41 and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.”
00:02:47 Holy spirit can help us to remember.
00:02:50 It can bring back to our minds.
00:02:52 What does it help us to remember?
00:02:54 Well, many times it’s comforting thoughts from God’s Word itself.
00:02:58 Consider just one news item from jw.org.
00:03:02 In December 2021, Pyotr and his wife, Maya,
00:03:06 received a three-year suspended prison sentence
00:03:08 for discussing religious materials with their friends.
00:03:12 When asked if he could recall an occasion when Jehovah helped him,
00:03:15 Pyotr said: “I [recall a time when] I prayed for holy spirit
00:03:20 “and then I remembered a thought from John 10:28, where it says:
00:03:24 “‘No one will snatch them out of my hand.’
00:03:28 “Reflecting on that point made me feel strong and happy.
00:03:32 “I could sense that my Father was right by my side.
00:03:36 As a result, I felt calmer and more confident.”
00:03:41 There it is: Jehovah was comforting one of his servants
00:03:45 with his holy spirit.
00:03:47 Now, in what situations
00:03:49 do you need the holy spirit to be a comforter,
00:03:53 encourager, or an advocate?
00:03:56 We all know our own plague—our own pain.
00:03:59 Jehovah does too, and he will use his holy spirit
00:04:03 to help us display love, joy, peace, patience,
00:04:08 mildness, goodness, faith, self-control,
00:04:12 or other qualities that we need in our service to him.
00:04:15 Although Jehovah has a monopoly on holy spirit,
00:04:18 he isn’t stingy.
00:04:21 The greater our need for holy spirit, the greater his generosity.
00:04:26 Even though 8 million of Jehovah’s servants may be requesting his spirit,
00:04:31 it doesn’t drive up the price.
00:04:33 Holy spirit is a free gift.
00:04:36 Well, what is the lesson for us?
00:04:39 Let’s allow Jehovah to tell us through his inspired Word
00:04:41 at Proverbs 3:27, 28.
00:04:51 How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity?
00:04:54 Proverbs 3:27 says:
00:04:57 “Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it
00:04:59 “if it is within your power to help.
00:05:03 “Do not say to your neighbor, ‘Go away; come back later!
00:05:05 I will give it to you tomorrow,’ if you can give it now.”
00:05:09 The lesson?
00:05:11 Be generous like Jehovah.
00:05:14 Fill the needs of others.
00:05:18 What’s a second point that we can learn from Jehovah’s use of holy spirit?
00:05:23 Well, trust.
00:05:25 How does Jehovah distribute his spirit?
00:05:28 We find a clue at Philippians 1:19
00:05:34 —Philippians 1:19.
00:05:40 And there it says: “For I know that this will result in my salvation
00:05:45 “through your supplication and with the support
00:05:48 of the spirit of Jesus Christ.”
00:05:52 What does that mean, “the spirit of Jesus Christ”?
00:05:56 Well, the study note on “the spirit of Jesus Christ”
00:05:58 says that apparently this refers “to Jesus’ use of God’s holy spirit,
00:06:03 or active force.”
00:06:05 The study note continues: “[Acts] 2:33 says that Jesus
00:06:08 “‘received the promised holy spirit from the Father.’
00:06:11 “At [Philippians] 1:11, Paul prayed
00:06:13 “that Christians might ‘be filled with righteous fruit,
00:06:15 which is through Jesus Christ, to God’s glory and praise.’”
00:06:20 We note it says:
00:06:22 “Ever since Jesus was resurrected and he ascended to heaven,
00:06:26 God has used him to supply the needs of Christians on earth.”
00:06:32 That no doubt includes pouring out God’s holy spirit.
00:06:38 That’s a lot of trust.
00:06:40 Well, was Pentecost 33 C.E.
00:06:43 the first time that the Son of God used God’s holy spirit
00:06:47 in behalf of Jehovah’s—
00:06:49 That he used it to accomplish Jehovah’s will?
00:06:53 Well, notice Colossians 1:15, 16.
00:06:59 There it says regarding the Son of God:
00:07:02 “He is the image of the invisible God,
00:07:04 “the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him
00:07:07 all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.”
00:07:13 Jehovah, the Creator,
00:07:15 used his “master worker” to bring everything else into existence.
00:07:21 Did Jesus need to use Jehovah’s holy spirit to accomplish what he had been assigned?
00:07:26 That’s obvious.
00:07:28 The book “Come Be My Follower,” page 131, paragraph 8 says:
00:07:32 “In some respects, we might liken this cooperation between Father and Son
00:07:35 “to that of an architect working with a builder, or contractor,
00:07:39 who [brings] the architect’s . . . designs to reality.”
00:07:44 Is that evidence of trust by Jehovah?
00:07:47 Clearly.
00:07:49 Jehovah gave his Son the materials and the training
00:07:53 to accomplish an assigned task.
00:07:57 Well, what’s the lesson for us?
00:08:00 We find a principle at 2 Timothy 2:1, 2
00:08:07 —2 Timothy 2:1, 2.
00:08:09 There it says— Paul writing under inspiration to Timothy,
00:08:13 he said: “You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power
00:08:17 “in the undeserved kindness that is in Christ Jesus;
00:08:20 “and the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses,
00:08:24 “these things entrust to faithful men,
00:08:26 who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.”
00:08:31 There were four generations of teachers and learners
00:08:35 —the apostle Paul, Timothy,
00:08:38 faithful men, and still others.
00:08:41 The lesson for us:
00:08:43 Continue to train, continue to delegate, continue to trust.
00:08:49 So, what have we considered?
00:08:51 Jehovah is generous with his use of holy spirit.
00:08:55 We should be generous with our time and possessions.
00:08:58 Jehovah trusts his Son to pour out his precious holy spirit.
00:09:01 We should delegate responsibility
00:09:03 and trust others to fulfill their assignments.
00:09:06 Indeed, the holy spirit is a precious free gift
00:09:09 from our generous Father.
00:09:11 May we all continue to beg for it,
00:09:14 trusting fully in “the one who can,
00:09:16 “according to his power that is operating in us,
00:09:19 “do more than superabundantly
00:09:22 beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”
