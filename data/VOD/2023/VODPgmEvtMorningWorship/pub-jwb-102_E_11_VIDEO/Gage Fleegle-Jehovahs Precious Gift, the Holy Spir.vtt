00:00:02.273 --> 00:00:06.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
What can we learn about generosity and trust

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.572 line:10% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s use of the holy spirit?

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:12.366 line:10% position:50% align:center
First, let’s consider generosity.

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.410 line:10% position:50% align:center
If you had a monopoly

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
on all the energy and fuel in the universe,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you distribute it freely and generously

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
or would you charge the highest price
possible for it by the gallon?

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what example does our Father set

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to providing his holy spirit?

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note the inspired words
of the apostle John at John chapter 3,

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice with me, please, verse 34.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 3:34, there it says:

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:48.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the one whom God sent
speaks the sayings of God,

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
for He [Jehovah]
does not give the spirit sparingly.”

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, <i>The New American Bible </i> says here:

00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He does not ration his gift of the Spirit.”

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of Bible examples
from the Hebrew Scriptures

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah gave his holy spirit generously?

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:11.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bezalel was filled with the power of God.

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua “was full of the spirit of wisdom.”

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s spirit empowered Samson.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about in the Greek Scriptures?

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, John the Baptizer was filled
with holy spirit even before birth.

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then there was the anointing
of Jesus’ disciples with holy spirit

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Pentecost 33 C.E.,

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is referred to in today’s text.

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 2:4 says that those disciples

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:40.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all became filled with holy spirit

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started to speak in different languages.”

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah uses his holy spirit

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:50.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish different things
in harmony with his purpose,

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there is no doubt
that he provides it generously.

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:57.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what about in our day?

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words reveal one of the ways
that holy spirit is used in our behalf.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re still there in the book of John,

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:09.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice Jesus’ words at John 14:16, 17.

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “And I will ask the Father

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will give you another helper

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be with you forever,
the spirit of the truth.”

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:24.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note for John 14:16 says

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the word “helper”
could also mean “comforter; 

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:31.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
encourager; advocate.”

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can holy spirit be a comforter?

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 26 mentions

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the helper, the holy spirit, . . .

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that one will teach you all things

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring back to your minds
all the things I told you.”

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holy spirit can help us to remember.

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can bring back to our minds.

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it help us to remember?

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many times it’s comforting thoughts
from God’s Word itself.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider just one news item from jw.org.

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
In December 2021, Pyotr and his wife, Maya,

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
received a three-year
suspended prison sentence

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:12.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
for discussing religious materials
with their friends.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
When asked if he could recall
an occasion when Jehovah helped him,

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pyotr said: “I [recall a time
when] I prayed for holy spirit

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:24.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and then I remembered
a thought from John 10:28, where it says: 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No one
will snatch them out of my hand.’

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reflecting on that point
made me feel strong and happy.

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I could sense that my Father
was right by my side.

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, I felt calmer
and more confident.”

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:45.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is: Jehovah was comforting
one of his servants

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his holy spirit.

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in what situations

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you need
the holy spirit to be a comforter,

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
encourager, or an advocate?

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:59.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all know our own plague—our own pain.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:03.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does too,
and he will use his holy spirit

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us display
love, joy, peace, patience,

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
mildness, goodness, faith, self-control,

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other qualities
that we need in our service to him.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Jehovah
has a monopoly on holy spirit,

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
he isn’t stingy.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greater our need for holy spirit,
the greater his generosity.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though 8 million of Jehovah’s servants
may be requesting his spirit,

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t drive up the price.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holy spirit is a free gift.

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:39.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what is the lesson for us?

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s allow Jehovah to tell us
through his inspired Word

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 3:27, 28.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity?

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:27 says:

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not withhold good
from those to whom you should give it

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:03.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if it is within your power to help.

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:05.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not say to your neighbor,
‘Go away; come back later!

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give it to you tomorrow,’
if you can give it now.”

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson?

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:14.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be generous like Jehovah.

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fill the needs of others.

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:23.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s a second point that we can learn
from Jehovah’s use of holy spirit?

00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:25.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, trust.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah distribute his spirit?

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find a clue at Philippians 1:19

00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:38.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Philippians 1:19.

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:45.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there it says: “For I know
that this will result in my salvation

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:48.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through your supplication
and with the support

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the spirit of Jesus Christ.”

00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:56.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean,
“the spirit of Jesus Christ”?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the study note
on “the spirit of Jesus Christ”

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:03.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that apparently this refers
“to Jesus’ use of God’s holy spirit,

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
or active force.”

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note continues:
“[Acts] 2:33 says that Jesus

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:11.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘received the promised holy spirit
from the Father.’

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:13.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At [Philippians] 1:11, Paul prayed

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Christians might ‘be filled
with righteous fruit,

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:20.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is through Jesus Christ,
to God’s glory and praise.’”

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:22.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
We note it says:

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:26.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ever since Jesus was resurrected
and he ascended to heaven,

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:30.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has used him to supply the needs
of Christians on earth.”

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:36.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
That no doubt includes
pouring out God’s holy spirit.

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:40.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a lot of trust.

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:43.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was Pentecost 33 C.E.

00:06:43.298 --> 00:06:47.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first time that the Son of God
used God’s holy spirit

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of Jehovah’s—

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
That he used it
to accomplish Jehovah’s will?

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:56.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice Colossians 1:15, 16.

00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:02.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says regarding the Son of God:

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is the image of the invisible God,

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the firstborn of all creation;
because by means of him

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
all other things were created
in the heavens and on the earth.”

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, the Creator,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
used his “master worker”
to bring everything else into existence.

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:26.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Jesus need to use Jehovah’s holy spirit
to accomplish what he had been assigned?

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:28.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s obvious.

00:07:28.427 --> 00:07:32.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book <i>“Come Be My Follower,”</i>
page 131, paragraph 8 says:

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In some respects, we might liken
this cooperation between Father and Son

00:07:35.934 --> 00:07:39.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to that of an architect
working with a builder, or contractor,

00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:43.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
who [brings] the architect’s . . .
designs to reality.”

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:47.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that evidence of trust by Jehovah?

00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:49.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly.

00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:53.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave his Son
the materials and the training

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:56.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish an assigned task.

00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:00.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the lesson for us?

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find a principle at 2 Timothy 2:1, 2

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:09.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Timothy 2:1, 2.

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says—
Paul writing under inspiration to Timothy,

00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:17.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “You, therefore, my child,
keep on acquiring power

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:20.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the undeserved kindness
that is in Christ Jesus;

00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:24.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the things you heard from me
that were supported by many witnesses,

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:26.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“these things entrust to faithful men,

00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:30.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, in turn, will be adequately qualified
to teach others.”

00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:35.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were four generations
of teachers and learners

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:38.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the apostle Paul, Timothy,

00:08:38.288 --> 00:08:41.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithful men, and still others.

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson for us:

00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:47.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to train,
continue to delegate, continue to trust.

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we considered?

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:55.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is generous
with his use of holy spirit.

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:58.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be generous
with our time and possessions.

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:01.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah trusts his Son
to pour out his precious holy spirit.

00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:03.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should delegate responsibility

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trust others
to fulfill their assignments.

00:09:06.274 --> 00:09:09.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, the holy spirit
is a precious free gift

00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:11.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our generous Father.

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:14.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue to beg for it,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting fully in “the one who can,

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:19.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to his power
that is operating in us,

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do more than superabundantly

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:25.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”
