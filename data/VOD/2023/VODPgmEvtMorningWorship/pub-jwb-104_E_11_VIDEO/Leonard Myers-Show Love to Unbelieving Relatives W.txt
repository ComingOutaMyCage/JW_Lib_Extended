00:00:01 Our text comments mention
00:00:03 our dealings with unbelieving family members
00:00:06 and the need for us to put our loyalty to Jehovah
00:00:09 ahead of our love for them.
00:00:11 Now, that raises some questions.
00:00:13 Why might loyalty to Jehovah
00:00:15 over love for family be an issue?
00:00:18 Is there a Bible character who set an example for us
00:00:21 in putting loyalty to Jehovah ahead of love for family?
00:00:25 And how can we display loyalty to Jehovah
00:00:27 while still showing love to our unbelieving family members?
00:00:32 Our first question is,
00:00:34 Why, at times, is loyalty to Jehovah over love for family an issue?
00:00:38 Well, Jesus said it would be.
00:00:40 Please turn with me to Matthew chapter 10.
00:00:44 And here Jesus explained that one effect of a person’s becoming a Christian
00:00:48 would be that relatives might oppose.
00:00:50 At Matthew chapter 10, notice verses 34 and 35:
00:00:56 “Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth;
00:01:00 “I came to bring, not peace, but a sword.
00:01:03 “For I came to cause division, with a man against his father,
00:01:06 “and a daughter against her mother,
00:01:08 and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”
00:01:12 Now, in saying “Do not think I came to bring peace,”
00:01:15 Jesus meant that some of his listeners
00:01:17 needed to think of the consequences of becoming his follower.
00:01:21 Holding faithfully to his teachings would be challenging
00:01:24 if family members would reject the truth.
00:01:27 And perhaps some of us have experienced that.
00:01:30 When we became Jehovah’s Witnesses, we were opposed by our family.
00:01:34 Perhaps we’re still being opposed,
00:01:36 or they may have opposed our decisions to set and achieve spiritual goals,
00:01:41 such as pioneering or coming to Bethel.
00:01:44 This was true of one member of our Bethel family.
00:01:48 When this brother accepted the truth as a young person,
00:01:50 he stated that his father was very disappointed in him.
00:01:54 His father was confused, since prior to studying the Bible,
00:01:58 this brother’s worldly pursuits were turning out well.
00:02:02 And then when our brother was invited to Bethel,
00:02:04 he stated that his father was really puzzled and concerned.
00:02:08 He felt that his son was not making right choices in life.
00:02:12 The brother wrote this:
00:02:15 “My dad had always been a loving and responsible father.
00:02:18 “We lacked nothing and had his active support.
00:02:21 “Now I felt like I was letting him down,
00:02:24 “as if I was turning my back on him
00:02:26 “and not showing him the appreciation that a father deserves.
00:02:29 This was hard for me.”
00:02:32 The brother’s feelings were real.
00:02:34 And it’s true that we don’t want to hurt our family.
00:02:37 It’s normal to love our unbelieving family members.
00:02:40 So why the issue?
00:02:43 Because we decided and proved by our dedication
00:02:46 that we’re going to put our loyalty to Jehovah
00:02:49 ahead of our love for family.
00:02:52 And when some family members realize that,
00:02:55 they may feel that we’re rejecting them,
00:02:57 and that can create a division like that caused by a sword,
00:03:01 as Jesus stated here in Matthew chapter 10.
00:03:05 Is there a Bible character
00:03:07 who set an example of loyalty to Jehovah over love for family?
00:03:12 Well, how about this individual on our monitors
00:03:15 —Jonathan, the son of King Saul?
00:03:18 Shortly after David defeated Goliath,
00:03:20 1 Samuel chapter 18 tells us
00:03:22 that “Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship.”
00:03:26 They made a covenant because Jonathan loved David as himself.
00:03:32 So for the rest of his life, Jonathan was loyal to David
00:03:35 —Jehovah’s chosen one—
00:03:37 and thus Jonathan was loyal to Jehovah.
00:03:42 Now, as we know, in time, Jonathan’s father, King Saul,
00:03:45 was determined to kill David.
00:03:47 So Jonathan faced a conflict of loyalties.
00:03:50 Would he continue to put his loyalty to Jehovah
00:03:54 ahead of his love for family?
00:03:56 Well, we know he did.
00:03:58 But look at the division that resulted.
00:04:01 Please turn with me to 1 Samuel chapter 20,
00:04:05 and let’s read together verses 30 through 33.
00:04:08 Notice the division between Jonathan and his father
00:04:12 —1 Samuel 20:30:
00:04:15 “Then Saul became enraged with Jonathan,
00:04:18 “and he said to him: ‘You son of a rebellious woman,
00:04:22 “‘do you think I do not know
00:04:24 “‘that you are choosing to side with the son of Jesse,
00:04:27 “‘to your own shame and to the shame of your mother?
00:04:30 “‘As long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth,
00:04:33 “‘you and your kingship will not be firmly established.
00:04:36 “So now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die.’
00:04:41 “However, Jonathan said to Saul his father:
00:04:44 “‘Why should he be put to death?
00:04:47 “What has he done?’
00:04:49 “At that Saul hurled the spear at him to strike him,
00:04:53 so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.”
00:04:58 Talk about family opposition!
00:05:01 Now, few, if any, of us have experienced that type of response
00:05:04 from unbelieving relatives.
00:05:06 So, what would Jonathan do?
00:05:08 Would he begin to reason that he needed to now change his priorities
00:05:12 and put love of family ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?
00:05:17 The answer is in verse 42:
00:05:19 “Jonathan said to David: ‘Go in peace,
00:05:23 “‘since we have both sworn in the name of Jehovah, saying,
00:05:26 “‘“May Jehovah be between you and me
00:05:29 and between your offspring and my offspring forever.”’”
00:05:33 So loyalty to God had first place in Jonathan’s heart,
00:05:37 and he proved his loyalty to Jehovah ahead of his love for family.
00:05:42 Now, he still supported and cooperated with his father when possible.
00:05:46 How do we know?
00:05:48 When the Philistines were battling Israel,
1 Samuel 31:2 states:
00:05:54 “The Philistines kept in close range of Saul
00:05:57 “and his sons,
00:05:59 “and the Philistines struck down Jonathan,
00:06:03 Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul’s sons.”
00:06:07 So Jonathan supported his father down to the end of his life.
00:06:10 Yet, Jonathan’s loyalty was with Jehovah.
00:06:15 What an outstanding example for those of us
00:06:17 with unbelieving family members!
00:06:19 We still love them.
00:06:20 We still support them as we’re able,
00:06:23 but we put our loyalty to Jehovah ahead of our love for them.
00:06:28 Now, how can we display Jonathanlike loyalty to Jehovah
00:06:32 and still show love for our unbelieving family members?
00:06:35 That’s our third question.
00:06:37 Well, we can let Bible principles guide us.
00:06:41 Here are five principles that can help,
00:06:43 four of which appeared in the Watchtower  article
00:06:45 that our comments are taken from.
00:06:48 Point 1: If conflicts arise with unbelieving family members,
00:06:52 try to reason with them in a loving way.
00:06:55 Earlier, we read 1 Samuel 20:32,
00:06:58 where Jonathan tried to reason with Saul about David.
00:07:01 Remember the questions he asked?
00:07:03 “Why should he be put to death?
00:07:05 What has he done?”
00:07:07 Of course, reasoning may not always work as it didn’t with Saul,
00:07:11 but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.
00:07:14 Point 2: Have empathy for unbelieving relatives.
00:07:18 Try to see things from their viewpoint,
00:07:20 and listen carefully to understand their concerns.
00:07:23 Proverbs 20:5 states:
00:07:25 “The thoughts of a man’s heart are like deep waters,
00:07:29 but the discerning man draws them out.”
00:07:32 Point 3: Speak with mildness.
00:07:36 We can ask Jehovah for his holy spirit to display its fruitage
00:07:39 when speaking with our relatives.
00:07:42 If they hurt us by their speech or actions,
00:07:44 we can do as 1 Corinthians 4:12, 13 states:
00:07:48 “When insulted, we bless;
00:07:51 “when persecuted, we patiently endure;
00:07:54 when slandered, we answer mildly.”
00:07:58 Point 4: Maintain fine conduct.
00:08:02 Although mild speech is helpful in dealing with opposing relatives,
00:08:05 our good conduct can speak even louder.
00:08:08 First Peter 3:16 states:
00:08:10 “Maintain a good conscience,
00:08:12 “so that in whatever way you are spoken against,
00:08:15 “those who speak against you may be put to shame
00:08:18 because of your good conduct as followers of Christ.”
00:08:23 Point 5: Plan ahead.
00:08:26 Proverbs 22:3:
00:08:28 “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.”
00:08:31 Now, it’s not that we should conceal ourselves
00:08:34 from our unbelieving relatives
00:08:35 but, rather, when visiting them, think of situations or topics
00:08:38 that might lead to conflict
00:08:40 and determine how to handle them ahead of time.
00:08:43 So those are five Bible principles
00:08:45 that can help us to display love to our unbelieving relatives
00:08:48 and still prove our loyalty to Jehovah.
00:08:52 How did things work out for the Bethelite we mentioned earlier?
00:08:56 His father stated:
00:08:58 “My son’s determination and seriousness was convincing
00:09:01 “and helped me to appreciate that he was serious
00:09:03 “about his decision to serve Jehovah.
00:09:06 “Later, when I visited Bethel,
00:09:08 “I was thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness and organization.
00:09:12 I was convinced that he made the right decision.”
00:09:17 The son concludes: “My dad is now serving Jehovah.
00:09:22 “He is a regular pioneer with my mom,
00:09:24 and we serve on the same body of elders.”
00:09:28 As was the case with this brother and Jonathan the son of Saul,
00:09:32 let’s continue to put our loyalty to Jehovah
00:09:35 ahead of our love for family.
