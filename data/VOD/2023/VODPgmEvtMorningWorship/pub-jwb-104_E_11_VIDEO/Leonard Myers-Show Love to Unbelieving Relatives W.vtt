00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:03.453 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our text comments mention

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:06.656 line:10% position:50% align:center
our dealings with unbelieving family members

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.659 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the need for us to put our loyalty to Jehovah

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
ahead of our love for them.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, that raises some questions.

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:15.699 line:10% position:50% align:center
Why might loyalty to Jehovah

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
over love for family be an issue?

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a Bible character
who set an example for us

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:25.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
in putting loyalty to Jehovah
ahead of love for family?

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can we display loyalty to Jehovah

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:32.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
while still showing love
to our unbelieving family members?

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our first question is,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, at times, is loyalty to Jehovah
over love for family an issue?

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus said it would be.

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:44.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Matthew chapter 10.

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here Jesus explained that one effect
of a person’s becoming a Christian

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be that relatives might oppose.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:54.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew chapter 10,
notice verses 34 and 35:

00:00:56.372 --> 00:01:00.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not think I came
to bring peace to the earth;

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I came to bring, not peace, but a sword.

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:06.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I came to cause division,
with a man against his father,

00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:08.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a daughter against her mother,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:10.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law.”

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in saying
“Do not think I came to bring peace,”

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus meant that some of his listeners

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to think of the consequences
of becoming his follower.

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holding faithfully to his teachings
would be challenging

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:27.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
if family members would reject the truth.

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:30.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps some of us have experienced that.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we became Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we were opposed by our family.

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we’re still being opposed,

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they may have opposed our decisions
to set and achieve spiritual goals,

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as pioneering or coming to Bethel.

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was true of one member
of our Bethel family.

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:50.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
When this brother
accepted the truth as a young person,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
he stated that his father
was very disappointed in him.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:58.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
His father was confused,
since prior to studying the Bible,

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:02.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
this brother’s worldly pursuits
were turning out well.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:04.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when our brother
was invited to Bethel,

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
he stated that his father
was really puzzled and concerned.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:12.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt that his son
was not making right choices in life.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother wrote this:

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My dad had always been
a loving and responsible father.

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:21.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We lacked nothing
and had his active support.

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:24.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I felt like I was letting him down,

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as if I was turning my back on him

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and not showing him the appreciation
that a father deserves.

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was hard for me.”

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother’s feelings were real.

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:37.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s true
that we don’t want to hurt our family.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s normal to love
our unbelieving family members.

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why the issue?

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:46.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we decided
and proved by our dedication

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re going to put
our loyalty to Jehovah

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:52.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of our love for family.

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:55.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when some family members realize that,

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may feel that we’re rejecting them,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that can create a division
like that caused by a sword,

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:03.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus stated here in Matthew chapter 10.

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a Bible character

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
who set an example of loyalty to Jehovah
over love for family?

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how about
this individual on our monitors

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jonathan, the son of King Saul?

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after David defeated Goliath,

00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Samuel chapter 18 tells us

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:26.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jonathan and David
became bound together in close friendship.”

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made a covenant
because Jonathan loved David as himself.

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for the rest of his life,
Jonathan was loyal to David

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s chosen one—

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:41.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus Jonathan was loyal to Jehovah.

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:45.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we know, in time,
Jonathan’s father, King Saul,

00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:47.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
was determined to kill David.

00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:50.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jonathan faced a conflict of loyalties.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:54.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he continue
to put his loyalty to Jehovah

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of his love for family?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know he did.

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look at the division that resulted.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:05.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to 1 Samuel chapter 20,

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:08.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together verses 30 through 33.

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:12.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the division
between Jonathan and his father

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:15.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Samuel 20:30:

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Saul became enraged with Jonathan,

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:22.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to him:
‘You son of a rebellious woman,

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:24.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘do you think I do not know

00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that you are choosing to side
with the son of Jesse,

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:30.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to your own shame
and to the shame of your mother?

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘As long as the son of Jesse
is alive on the earth,

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:36.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you and your kingship
will not be firmly established.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:41.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So now send someone
to bring him to me, for he must die.’

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Jonathan said to Saul his father:

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:47.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Why should he be put to death?

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What has he done?’

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:53.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that Saul
hurled the spear at him to strike him,

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Jonathan knew that his father
was determined to put David to death.”

00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:01.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about family opposition!

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, few, if any, of us
have experienced that type of response

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:06.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
from unbelieving relatives.

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would Jonathan do?

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he begin to reason
that he needed to now change his priorities

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put love of family
ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is in verse 42:

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:23.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jonathan said to David:
‘Go in peace,

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘since we have both sworn
in the name of Jehovah, saying,

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:29.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“May Jehovah be between you and me

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and between your offspring
and my offspring forever.”’”

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
So loyalty to God had first place
in Jonathan’s heart,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he proved his loyalty to Jehovah
ahead of his love for family.

00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:46.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he still supported
and cooperated with his father when possible.

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:48.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know?

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:53.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Philistines were battling Israel,
1 Samuel 31:2 states:

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Philistines kept in close range of Saul

00:05:57.507 --> 00:05:59.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his sons,

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Philistines struck down Jonathan,

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:07.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul’s sons.”

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:10.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jonathan supported his father
down to the end of his life.

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:15.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Jonathan’s loyalty was with Jehovah.

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:17.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an outstanding example for those of us

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
with unbelieving family members!

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:20.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still love them.

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:23.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still support them as we’re able,

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:27.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we put our loyalty to Jehovah
ahead of our love for them.

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can we display
Jonathanlike loyalty to Jehovah

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:35.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still show love
for our unbelieving family members?

00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:37.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s our third question.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can let Bible principles guide us.

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are five principles that can help,

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
four of which appeared
in the <i>Watchtower</i>  article

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:48.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our comments are taken from.

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:52.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point 1: If conflicts arise
with unbelieving family members,

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to reason with them in a loving way.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, we read 1 Samuel 20:32,

00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:01.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jonathan
tried to reason with Saul about David.

00:07:01.637 --> 00:07:03.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the questions he asked?

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why should he be put to death?

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has he done?”

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:11.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, reasoning may not always work
as it didn’t with Saul,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point 2: Have empathy
for unbelieving relatives.

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:20.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to see things from their viewpoint,

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listen carefully
to understand their concerns.

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 20:5 states:

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:29.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The thoughts of a man’s heart
are like deep waters,

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the discerning man draws them out.”

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point 3: Speak with mildness.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can ask Jehovah
for his holy spirit to display its fruitage

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:42.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
when speaking with our relatives.

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:44.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they hurt us by their speech or actions,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can do as 1 Corinthians 4:12, 13 states:

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:51.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When insulted, we bless;

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:54.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when persecuted, we patiently endure;

00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:57.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
when slandered, we answer mildly.”

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point 4: Maintain fine conduct.

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:05.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although mild speech is helpful
in dealing with opposing relatives,

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
our good conduct can speak even louder.

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:10.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 3:16 states:

00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:12.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maintain a good conscience,

00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:15.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that in whatever way
you are spoken against,

00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those who speak against you
may be put to shame

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:22.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of your good conduct
as followers of Christ.”

00:08:23.853 --> 00:08:26.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point 5: Plan ahead.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:28.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 22:3:

00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:31.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The shrewd one
sees the danger and conceals himself.”

00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s not that we
should conceal ourselves

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our unbelieving relatives

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:38.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, when visiting them,
think of situations or topics

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might lead to conflict

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and determine
how to handle them ahead of time.

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those are five Bible principles

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:48.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us to display love
to our unbelieving relatives

00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:51.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still prove our loyalty to Jehovah.

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:56.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did things work out
for the Bethelite we mentioned earlier?

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:58.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
His father stated:

00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My son’s determination and seriousness
was convincing

00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:03.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and helped me to appreciate
that he was serious

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about his decision to serve Jehovah.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Later, when I visited Bethel,

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:12.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was thoroughly impressed
with the cleanliness and organization.

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:17.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was convinced
that he made the right decision.”

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
The son concludes:
“My dad is now serving Jehovah.

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:24.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is a regular pioneer with my mom,

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:27.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we serve on the same body of elders.”

00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
As was the case with this brother
and Jonathan the son of Saul,

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s continue to put our loyalty to Jehovah

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:37.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of our love for family.
