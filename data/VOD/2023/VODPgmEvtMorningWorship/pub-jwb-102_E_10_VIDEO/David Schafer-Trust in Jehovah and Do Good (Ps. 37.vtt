“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good . . .

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.364 line:10% position:50% align:center
and act with faithfulness”

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:11.616 line:10% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 37:3.

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.201 line:10% position:50% align:center
The <i>Watchtower </i> study article

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
that introduced this

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:18.165 line:10% position:50% align:center
as the yeartext for 2017

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:21.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
opened up a beautiful and practical way

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
of thinking about
how to manage problems in life:

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recognize what you cannot do,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:29.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trust in Jehovah.

00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recognize what you can do, and do that.

00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:37.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the article gave us
a number of examples of people

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
who did that in a variety of circumstances.

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:42.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah recognized

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he could not force wicked people
to accept his message.

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:52.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had no control over
when the Flood would come,

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he could faithfully proclaim
the warning message,

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:00.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he could build the ark.

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:04.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he focused on doing those things,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting in Jehovah for the rest.

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:10.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
King David after sinning seriously

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:15.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognized that he couldn’t undo
what he had done.

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:20.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neither could he escape
the consequences for what he had done.

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he could avail himself
of Jehovah’s arrangements,

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:28.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
accept correction, and move forward.

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:30.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we take ourselves
through that exercise,

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can apply that way of thinking
to any number of situations

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we face in life.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:40.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recognize what you cannot do,
and trust in Jehovah.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:45.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recognize what you can do,
and do that.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also think about Bible examples of people

00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:52.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were in a situation
that you can identify with.

00:01:52.308 --> 00:01:57.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, say you have
an enormously difficult task to accomplish

00:01:57.272 --> 00:01:59.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very short period of time.

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:03.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of someone in the Bible
who faced a similar situation?

00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:05.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many possibilities come to mind.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s focus on 2 Chronicles chapter 14

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:11.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the account of Asa.

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Chronicles 14:9 says:

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:19.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Later Zerah the Ethiopian came against them

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:23.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with an army of 1,000,000 men

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 300 chariots.”

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
How big was Asa’s army?

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:33.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says
580,000 men with hand weapons.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Zerah’s army was almost twice as large
and far better equipped.

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:39.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would Asa do?

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11:

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:45.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Asa then called to Jehovah his God and said:

00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:48.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘O Jehovah, it does not matter to you

00:02:48.244 --> 00:02:52.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘whether those you help
are many or have no power.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Help us, O Jehovah our God,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for we are relying on you,

00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and in your name
we have come against this crowd.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘O Jehovah, you are our God.

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:08.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not let mortal man prevail against you.’”

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:12.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Asa knew

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:16.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he could not turn
Zerah away in his own power.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew he could not fight

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:22.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
a million-man army with 300 chariots and win.

00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:25.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he left the impossible to Jehovah.

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:29.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what could Asa do?

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:33.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verses 12-14,
and as you read this,

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:35.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Jehovah gets the credit for

00:03:35.837 --> 00:03:39.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what Asa gets the credit for.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians

00:03:42.928 --> 00:03:45.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“before Asa and before Judah,

00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:48.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Ethiopians fled.

00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:50.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Asa and the people with him

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:54.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pursued them as far as Gerar,

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:57.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Ethiopians continued falling.”

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Asa continued gathering much spoil,

00:04:02.616 --> 00:04:07.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
much of which he later sacrificed to Jehovah.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when faced with an impossible task,

00:04:09.373 --> 00:04:12.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asa recognized what he could not do
and trusted in Jehovah,

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:16.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also recognized what he could do,
and he did that.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:19.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did Jehovah actually need

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asa’s military force?

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
More on that in a minute.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:30.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, how can we apply Psalm 37:3 today?

00:04:30.855 --> 00:04:32.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you facing a difficult work assignment?

00:04:32.982 --> 00:04:36.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
a challenging personality?
a dynamic health crisis?

00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:38.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
a financial shortfall?

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:42.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt this Psalm 37:3 process
can help you to think productively.

00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of an accident,
a brother in the Midwest

00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:49.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
lost a well-paying job
that he held for 14 years.

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:52.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now his family had no income.

00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:53.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
They supplicated Jehovah.

00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
They trusted in Jehovah first and foremost,

00:04:56.466 --> 00:05:00.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
but was there anything
that they could actually do

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:02.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
in conjunction with that?

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:03.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:05.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
They cut down on their expenses.

00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:08.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gleaned in nearby fields.

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:10.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
They fished for their food.

00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:12.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
With help from the congregation

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:15.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and taking some part-time work
when it became available,

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:18.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
this family of four managed.

00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:20.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
A year after the accident, the mother said:

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We can fool ourselves into thinking

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:26.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we are relying upon Jehovah

00:05:26.373 --> 00:05:28.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when we are really relying upon

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:33.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our own abilities, our mate, or our job.

00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:38.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We, though, really learned to trust just Him

00:05:38.553 --> 00:05:40.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, Jehovah].

00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:43.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These other things can be taken away,

00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:45.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but Jehovah never left us
—not for one moment.

00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:48.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though we have just the bare necessities,

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:52.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
our relationship with Jehovah as a family
is much closer.”

00:05:53.194 --> 00:05:55.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Candid observation.

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:59.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.”

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:01.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like a simple equation,

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how easy it could be

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:07.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
to mistake the “do what is good” part

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:11.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
for trusting in our own abilities!

00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened to Asa

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:18.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than a decade after his smashing victory

00:06:18.304 --> 00:06:21.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the million Ethiopians?

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Chronicles 16:1-3,

00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:28.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
he faces another confrontation:

00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:32.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the 36th year of the reign of Asa,

00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:37.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“King Baasha of Israel came up against Judah
and began to build up Ramah

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:42.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent anyone from going out
or coming in to King Asa of Judah.”

00:06:42.038 --> 00:06:46.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would Asa do in this case?

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:49.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that Asa brought out silver and gold

00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the treasuries of Jehovah’s house

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so he’s spending Jehovah’s money;

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“surely, he consulted God about that]

00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:02.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the king’s house

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and sent them to King Ben-hadad of Syria,

00:07:05.897 --> 00:07:08.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who was dwelling in Damascus, saying:

00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:10.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘There is a treaty between me and you

00:07:10.986 --> 00:07:12.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and between my father and your father.

00:07:12.863 --> 00:07:14.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am sending you silver and gold.

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:18.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Come, break your treaty
with King Baasha of Israel,

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:23.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he will withdraw from me.’”

00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:25.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Asa thinking?

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:29.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he consider Baasha not much of a threat?

00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:32.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he thinking he was smart enough
to outmaneuver him?

00:07:32.343 --> 00:07:34.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did his strategy work?

00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:36.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading through verses 4-6,
it might at first appear

00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:40.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his plan was successful.

00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:42.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was the problem?

00:07:42.604 --> 00:07:47.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hanani explains in verses 7-9:

00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:53.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time Hanani the seer
came to King Asa of Judah and said to him:

00:07:53.324 --> 00:07:56.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Because you relied

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:59.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘on the king of Syria

00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and did not rely on Jehovah your God,

00:08:04.294 --> 00:08:09.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the army of the king of Syria
has escaped out of your hand.

00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:11.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:16.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a very great army
with many chariots and horsemen?

00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:19.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But because you relied on Jehovah,

00:08:19.602 --> 00:08:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘he gave them into your hand.

00:08:21.938 --> 00:08:24.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘through all the earth
to show his strength in behalf of those

00:08:27.527 --> 00:08:29.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘whose heart is complete toward him.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You have acted foolishly in this matter;

00:08:31.907 --> 00:08:36.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
from now on there will be wars against you.’”

00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:40.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we learn from this account?

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:43.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jehovah.

00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:45.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what Jehovah
has done for you in the past;

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to rely on him today.

00:08:48.508 --> 00:08:52.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing what is good is really an act of faith.

00:08:52.095 --> 00:08:54.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s evidence of participation,

00:08:54.098 --> 00:08:58.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our desire to receive Jehovah’s blessing.

00:08:58.102 --> 00:09:02.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we don’t outgrow trusting in Jehovah.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is looking for opportunities

00:09:04.484 --> 00:09:08.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to show his strength in behalf
of those whose heart is complete toward him.”

00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:12.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us
to the account of Asa’s son, Jehoshaphat.

00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:17.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat doubled Asa’s army
to exceed a million,

00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:19.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet he found himself terrified

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the onslaught of Moab and Ammon
in the mountainous region of Seir.

00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:26.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he do?
He trusted in Jehovah.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
What good could he do?

00:09:28.552 --> 00:09:31.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fighting in that instance
would have been an act of disobedience

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:33.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah told them simply to go out,

00:09:33.682 --> 00:09:36.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
stand still, and don’t be afraid.

00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:39.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they sang.

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing what is good
is a reflection of our faith

00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:45.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our desire for Jehovah’s blessing.

00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:47.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when that is the motive,

00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:51.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
it results in a resounding victory.

00:09:51.618 --> 00:09:55.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go out
and have a resounding victory today.
