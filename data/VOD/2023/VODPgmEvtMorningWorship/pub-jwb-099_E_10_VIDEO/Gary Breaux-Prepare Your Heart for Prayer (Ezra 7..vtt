00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:04.788 line:10% position:50% align:center
Ezra 7:10—that’s the scripture we’re discussing.

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:07.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
Ezra “prepared his heart”

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:09.993 line:10% position:50% align:center
so he could teach the regulations of Jehovah God.

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:11.828 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, how does that happen?

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.998 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, he did so through prayer,

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:18.101 line:10% position:50% align:center
through his own meditation,

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his personal study,

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:24.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and through observing other faithful
and loyal servants of Jehovah God.

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this is the very same process
that we use

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to teach at a Bible study.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to, though, at this time,

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:40.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how we can apply
Ezra’s words and example

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
when offering public prayers.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at times we’re privileged
to offer a prayer

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:50.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe here at Bethel,
in the congregation, at shepherding calls.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are given by brothers.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know,
there is another form of public prayer

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
often offered by sisters,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s the prayer with a Bible student.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:10.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for a moment, consider the prayers
that a Bible student may be familiar with.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
He probably
never heard the name Jehovah in a prayer.

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably, he’s heard
some renderings of the Our Father prayer

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
or has heard a minister

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
read a prayer from a prayer book.

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how different now
the prayers are going to be

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the teacher
and those that may accompany the teacher!

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:37.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, our prayers reflect

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:40.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
our own relationship with Jehovah God

00:01:40.283 --> 00:01:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have developed over time.

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our prayers are influenced
not only by our past experience in life

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also by observing
other loyal servants of Jehovah God

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:57.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listening to their prayers as well.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how that was the case with Ezra.

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:03.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Insight</i>  book says that Ezra lived

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
during “the time of Mordecai and Esther”

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the decree went out for the king

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:13.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to exterminate the Jews
throughout the Persian Empire.”

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, “there were many Jews
[that were] living in Babylon,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so this national crisis

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:23.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
[had] an indelible imprint on Ezra,”

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthening his faith in Jehovah God

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:28.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that He would deliver his people.

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:30.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:35.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra witnessed
the reaction of the people to this.

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn to Esther

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:41.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Esther 4:3—

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen to what’s recorded:

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And in every province where the king’s word
and his decree reached,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there was great mourning among the Jews,

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with fasting and weeping and wailing.

00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many were lying down in sackcloth and ashes.”

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:03.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, public fasting

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
was often accompanied
by earnest supplication,

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:10.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Ezra would have realized

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Esther was carrying on

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:16.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
this fervent supplication to Jehovah God

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
at that time as well.

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:22.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this all helped
to galvanize Ezra’s faith.

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, he witnessed
how Jehovah delivered his people

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this seemingly impossible situation

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah protected his people
from the enemies.

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
And living through all of that

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:41.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped to shape
Ezra’s inclination toward prayer.

00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:46.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, he learned that prayer is powerful.

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:51.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the way
it’s happened to all of us too, hasn’t it?

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:53.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve all been eyewitnesses

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s loving care for us

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for his people.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these experiences

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
have shaped our communications

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah God.

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:08.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there is something else
that helped Ezra.

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Insight</i>  book says
that he “was an [untiring] researcher,

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with discernment in deciding
between various readings

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:20.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the copies of the Law existing then.”

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:23.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
So imagine the impression
that was made on him

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:26.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
while he was comparing
the different renderings

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the prayers that he was copying

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:34.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
—prayers from Moses,
Hannah, David, and Daniel.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result,
this would have impressed upon him

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:42.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of prayers
Jehovah wanted to have recorded.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
So from his own life experience,

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
observing the faith of others
and prayers of others,

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he was able to meditate on now:

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:57.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What about God’s regulation
is going to help my audience?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And what about His regulations

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and the experiences of these people

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:05.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘can I use in my prayers

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
in speaking to Jehovah in their behalf?’

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus, that helped him
to be able to teach the Law

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:16.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to pray
to reach the hearts of the listeners.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
In preparing to say a prayer
before a large gathering of worshippers,

00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
one brother explains this; he said:

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:28.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I consider in advance
what to give thanks for,

00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what requests the brothers might have,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what petitions
I could mention on their behalf.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I put my ideas,
including expressions of praise,

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:41.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the right order in my mind.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before saying the public prayer,
I say a silent prayer asking for help

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
to represent the brothers
in a dignified manner.”

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the same process is followed

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:58.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
in offering a prayer at a Bible study.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
What specific needs does the student have

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:03.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would feel comfortable

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:07.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
addressing Jehovah with in their presence?

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:09.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they struggling with a bad habit?

00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe experiencing ridicule from family

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
or workmates or schoolmates?

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are the holidays or other celebrations
a challenge for them?

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:23.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
What could we commend them for
before Jehovah God?

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have they taken a stand against holidays

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
or smoking or immorality?

00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or are they speaking to others
about what they’re learning?

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:34.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
What progress are they making?

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:40.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, public prayers
do not have to be long and elaborate

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
—generally, short and meaningful is best.

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:49.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see an example
of when Ezra prayed in behalf of others,

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:52.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
petitioning Jehovah for his guidance.

00:06:52.962 --> 00:06:55.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can go to Ezra chapter 8

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 21 and 23.

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Then I proclaimed a fast there

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:07.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the river Ahava,

00:07:07.477 --> 00:07:10.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to humble ourselves before our God,

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:13.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to seek guidance from him for our journey,

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:15.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for us and for our children

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:18.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for all our goods.”

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 23:

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So we fasted
and made request of our God concerning this,

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:27.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he listened to our entreaty.”

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt, Ezra recalled the fasting

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:36.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
that accompanied the earnest petitions
of Esther years earlier.

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:41.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw guidance from Jehovah God
in the assignment that he had at hand.

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was traveling
with enormous riches on this occasion

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from a human perspective

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
was effectively unarmed and defenseless.

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:56.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this was a first for him;
he had never been down this road before.

00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:00.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
He needed and prayed
for God’s guidance and protection.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible student likewise is beginning

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
to traverse the ‘cramped road’

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Matthew 7:14.

00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:12.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like Ezra, he may feel,

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:15.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ve never been down this road before.’

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:17.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he needs guidance.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in our prayers, we might ask Jehovah

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:24.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give them more faith
to trust in Jehovah God.

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:27.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can specifically ask Jehovah

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
to empower the student as needed.

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:34.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a word of caution here:

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are accompanying someone
on a Bible study

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re asked to say one of the prayers,

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’d be good for us to remember

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:47.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we don’t have
the teacher-student relationship.

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conductor has that relationship.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as a guest on the study,

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t want our prayers
to become too specific

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
in connection with the needs of the student.

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:05.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our prayers at a Bible study

00:09:05.228 --> 00:09:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
can really have a powerful,
motivating effect on them.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
One pioneer sister in Sierra Leone

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
conducts 15 Bible studies each week.

00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:16.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what she said:

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:18.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Besides all the prayers offered

00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when in the other features of the ministry
and on other occasions,

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:25.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am able to pray to Jehovah 30 times a week

00:09:25.514 --> 00:09:28.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in behalf of my Bible studies.

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:32.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These prayers
seem to have a beneficial effect

00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strong influence
on the progress of the students.”

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:42.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we’re praying
in behalf of others publicly,

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:46.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us prepare our heart like Ezra

00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:50.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving careful thought
to the content of our prayers.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the student’s needs

00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can articulate that
in our petitions to Jehovah.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then set the example of humility

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
by asking Jehovah to help us,

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:06.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask for his forgiveness.

00:10:06.322 --> 00:10:10.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never underestimate
the far-reaching effects

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our sincere prayers
in behalf of others.

00:10:13.663 --> 00:10:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, we become
their advocate in our prayers.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a Bible student
listens to our prayers,

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:25.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will learn how to pray
from his heart to Jehovah God

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:29.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will learn, as did Ezra,

00:10:29.078 --> 00:10:32.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
that prayer is powerful.
