00:00:00 Ezra 7:10—that’s the scripture we’re discussing.
00:00:04 Ezra “prepared his heart”
00:00:07 so he could teach the regulations of Jehovah God.
00:00:09 Well, how does that happen?
00:00:11 Well, he did so through prayer,
00:00:14 through his own meditation,
00:00:18 through his personal study,
00:00:20 and through observing other faithful and loyal servants of Jehovah God.
00:00:25 Well, this is the very same process that we use
00:00:29 in order to teach at a Bible study.
00:00:33 I’d like to, though, at this time,
00:00:35 see how we can apply Ezra’s words and example
00:00:40 when offering public prayers.
00:00:44 Now, at times we’re privileged to offer a prayer
00:00:47 maybe here at Bethel, in the congregation, at shepherding calls.
00:00:50 Those are given by brothers.
00:00:53 But, you know, there is another form of public prayer
00:00:57 often offered by sisters,
00:01:00 and it’s the prayer with a Bible student.
00:01:05 Now, for a moment, consider the prayers that a Bible student may be familiar with.
00:01:10 He probably never heard the name Jehovah in a prayer.
00:01:13 Probably, he’s heard some renderings of the Our Father prayer
00:01:18 or has heard a minister
00:01:20 read a prayer from a prayer book.
00:01:24 But how different now the prayers are going to be
00:01:28 from the teacher and those that may accompany the teacher!
00:01:34 Really, our prayers reflect
00:01:37 our own relationship with Jehovah God
00:01:40 that we have developed over time.
00:01:43 Our prayers are influenced not only by our past experience in life
00:01:48 but also by observing other loyal servants of Jehovah God
00:01:53 and listening to their prayers as well.
00:01:57 Let’s see how that was the case with Ezra.
00:02:00 Now, the Insight  book says that Ezra lived
00:02:03 during “the time of Mordecai and Esther”
00:02:05 when the decree went out for the king
00:02:08 “to exterminate the Jews throughout the Persian Empire.”
00:02:13 Now, “there were many Jews [that were] living in Babylon,
00:02:16 “so this national crisis
00:02:19 [had] an indelible imprint on Ezra,”
00:02:23 strengthening his faith in Jehovah God
00:02:26 —that He would deliver his people.
00:02:28 As a result,
00:02:30 Ezra witnessed the reaction of the people to this.
00:02:35 If you turn to Esther
00:02:38 —Esther 4:3—
00:02:42 listen to what’s recorded:
00:02:45 “And in every province where the king’s word and his decree reached,
00:02:50 “there was great mourning among the Jews,
00:02:52 “along with fasting and weeping and wailing.
00:02:57 Many were lying down in sackcloth and ashes.”
00:03:01 Now, public fasting
00:03:03 was often accompanied by earnest supplication,
00:03:07 and Ezra would have realized
00:03:10 that Esther was carrying on
00:03:12 this fervent supplication to Jehovah God
00:03:16 at that time as well.
00:03:18 And this all helped to galvanize Ezra’s faith.
00:03:22 See, he witnessed how Jehovah delivered his people
00:03:25 in this seemingly impossible situation
00:03:29 and how Jehovah protected his people from the enemies.
00:03:33 And living through all of that
00:03:36 helped to shape Ezra’s inclination toward prayer.
00:03:41 See, he learned that prayer is powerful.
00:03:47 And that’s the way it’s happened to all of us too, hasn’t it?
00:03:51 We’ve all been eyewitnesses
00:03:53 to Jehovah’s loving care for us
00:03:57 and for his people.
00:03:58 And these experiences
00:04:01 have shaped our communications
00:04:03 with Jehovah God.
00:04:05 Now, there is something else that helped Ezra.
00:04:08 The Insight  book says that he “was an [untiring] researcher,
00:04:12 “with discernment in deciding between various readings
00:04:16 of the copies of the Law existing then.”
00:04:20 So imagine the impression that was made on him
00:04:23 while he was comparing the different renderings
00:04:26 of the prayers that he was copying
00:04:29 —prayers from Moses, Hannah, David, and Daniel.
00:04:35 And as a result, this would have impressed upon him
00:04:38 what kind of prayers Jehovah wanted to have recorded.
00:04:43 So from his own life experience,
00:04:46 observing the faith of others and prayers of others,
00:04:50 then he was able to meditate on now:
00:04:53 ‘What about God’s regulation is going to help my audience?
00:04:57 ‘And what about His regulations
00:05:00 ‘and the experiences of these people
00:05:02 ‘can I use in my prayers
00:05:05 in speaking to Jehovah in their behalf?’
00:05:09 And thus, that helped him to be able to teach the Law
00:05:13 and to pray to reach the hearts of the listeners.
00:05:17 In preparing to say a prayer before a large gathering of worshippers,
00:05:21 one brother explains this; he said:
00:05:24 “I consider in advance what to give thanks for,
00:05:28 “what requests the brothers might have,
00:05:30 “and what petitions I could mention on their behalf.
00:05:34 “I put my ideas, including expressions of praise,
00:05:38 “in the right order in my mind.
00:05:41 “Before saying the public prayer, I say a silent prayer asking for help
00:05:46 to represent the brothers in a dignified manner.”
00:05:51 Well, the same process is followed
00:05:54 in offering a prayer at a Bible study.
00:05:58 What specific needs does the student have
00:06:00 that we would feel comfortable
00:06:03 addressing Jehovah with in their presence?
00:06:07 Are they struggling with a bad habit?
00:06:09 maybe experiencing ridicule from family
00:06:12 or workmates or schoolmates?
00:06:15 Are the holidays or other celebrations a challenge for them?
00:06:19 What could we commend them for before Jehovah God?
00:06:23 Have they taken a stand against holidays
00:06:26 or smoking or immorality?
00:06:29 Or are they speaking to others about what they’re learning?
00:06:32 What progress are they making?
00:06:36 Now, public prayers do not have to be long and elaborate
00:06:40 —generally, short and meaningful is best.
00:06:45 Let’s see an example of when Ezra prayed in behalf of others,
00:06:49 petitioning Jehovah for his guidance.
00:06:52 We can go to Ezra chapter 8
00:06:55 and verses 21 and 23.
00:07:02 It says: “Then I proclaimed a fast there
00:07:05 “at the river Ahava,
00:07:07 “to humble ourselves before our God,
00:07:10 “to seek guidance from him for our journey,
00:07:13 “for us and for our children
00:07:15 and for all our goods.”
00:07:18 And verse 23:
00:07:19 “So we fasted and made request of our God concerning this,
00:07:24 and he listened to our entreaty.”
00:07:27 No doubt, Ezra recalled the fasting
00:07:31 that accompanied the earnest petitions of Esther years earlier.
00:07:36 He saw guidance from Jehovah God in the assignment that he had at hand.
00:07:41 He was traveling with enormous riches on this occasion
00:07:45 and from a human perspective
00:07:47 was effectively unarmed and defenseless.
00:07:51 So this was a first for him; he had never been down this road before.
00:07:56 He needed and prayed for God’s guidance and protection.
00:08:01 Well, the Bible student likewise is beginning
00:08:04 to traverse the ‘cramped road’
00:08:07 mentioned at Matthew 7:14.
00:08:10 And like Ezra, he may feel,
00:08:12 ‘I’ve never been down this road before.’
00:08:15 And he needs guidance.
00:08:17 So in our prayers, we might ask Jehovah
00:08:20 to give them more faith to trust in Jehovah God.
00:08:24 We can specifically ask Jehovah
00:08:27 to empower the student as needed.
00:08:31 Now, a word of caution here:
00:08:34 If we are accompanying someone on a Bible study
00:08:37 and we’re asked to say one of the prayers,
00:08:40 it’d be good for us to remember
00:08:42 that we don’t have the teacher-student relationship.
00:08:48 The conductor has that relationship.
00:08:50 So as a guest on the study,
00:08:53 we wouldn’t want our prayers to become too specific
00:08:57 in connection with the needs of the student.
00:09:02 But our prayers at a Bible study
00:09:05 can really have a powerful, motivating effect on them.
00:09:08 One pioneer sister in Sierra Leone
00:09:11 conducts 15 Bible studies each week.
00:09:14 And here’s what she said:
00:09:16 “Besides all the prayers offered
00:09:18 “when in the other features of the ministry and on other occasions,
00:09:22 “I am able to pray to Jehovah 30 times a week
00:09:25 “in behalf of my Bible studies.
00:09:28 “These prayers seem to have a beneficial effect
00:09:32 and strong influence on the progress of the students.”
00:09:37 So when we’re praying in behalf of others publicly,
00:09:42 let us prepare our heart like Ezra
00:09:46 by giving careful thought to the content of our prayers.
00:09:51 Let’s consider the student’s needs
00:09:53 and how we can articulate that in our petitions to Jehovah.
00:09:57 Then set the example of humility
00:10:01 by asking Jehovah to help us,
00:10:03 and ask for his forgiveness.
00:10:06 Never underestimate the far-reaching effects
00:10:10 of our sincere prayers in behalf of others.
00:10:13 Really, we become their advocate in our prayers.
00:10:18 And as a Bible student listens to our prayers,
00:10:21 he will learn how to pray from his heart to Jehovah God
00:10:25 and he will learn, as did Ezra,
00:10:29 that prayer is powerful.
