00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:02.752 line:10% position:50% align:center
The longer you live,

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:06.089 line:10% position:50% align:center
the more you realize that acquiring wisdom

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.992 line:10% position:50% align:center
is a lifelong process

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:10.593 line:10% position:50% align:center
—really, a daily one.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:13.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
But let’s just analyze the process

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:15.465 line:10% position:50% align:center
of acquiring wisdom.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
The basis for wisdom is knowledge,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the first step is to acquire knowledge.

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:27.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
But wisdom
isn’t just knowing a lot of things.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our <i>Insight</i>  book
under the subject “Knowledge” says this:

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:37.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wisdom is the ability
to put knowledge to work, or to use it,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the intelligent application of learning.

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:43.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A person might have considerable knowledge

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but not know how to use it

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of lacking wisdom.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus linked wisdom with accomplishment

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in saying: ‘Wisdom is proved righteous

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
by its works.’”

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:00.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate, someone once said,

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:02.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Knowledge without wisdom

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is like having flour, eggs,

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“butter, milk, and sugar

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not knowing
how to put it all together to make a cake.”

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we might say

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:19.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in God’s Word,
we have all the ingredients

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all the principles are there for wisdom.

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to know
how to put those principles together

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
—make the cake; the recipe is there.

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:34.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes in recipes
(most of the time, really),

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
they list all the ingredients and sometimes

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:43.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
even step-by-step procedures to make a cake.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think, ‘Well, I wish I could see

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘an expert cook or baker

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:52.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually put those ingredients together.’

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, interestingly today, on the Internet,

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have these videos
with experts doing just that.

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:04.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a way, that is what Jehovah

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:06.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
has done for us

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in the Bible,

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:11.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have not just principles

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:13.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we have accounts of people

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting those principles to work
in their life.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re showing us how to make the cake,
as it were.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:27.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s take an example
of a married couple

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:30.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
who might use accounts from the Bible
to help them

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:34.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
see principles being put to work

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:38.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
—examples that will help them
resolve a problem

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will preserve their peace and unity.

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I must add this disclaimer:

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the persons described in this scenario

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:51.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
resemble anyone you know,

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is plainly coincidental, as they say.

00:02:56.893 --> 00:03:01.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a wife, and she wants
to raise an issue with her husband.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the problem?

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
She feels stressed out.

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:08.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of them work every day
at their theocratic assignments.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
The husband is very hospitable,

00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he likes
to invite people over for a meal.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s nice.

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:18.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
She likes that too.

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
The problem is that she ends up
doing all the work

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:26.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
—making the menu, preparing the meal,
cleaning up afterward.

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s stressed.

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, she knows the principle

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:33.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ecclesiastes 3:7

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is “a time to keep quiet
and a time to speak.”

00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:42.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can she find an example in the Bible

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:46.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a wife who put that principle to work?

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:50.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, she thinks of Esther.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Esther—Queen Esther.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Esther chapter 5,

00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:00.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had a very delicate problem to discuss
with her husband, the king,

00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:03.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she likely knew this principle

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:06.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “a time to speak.”

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did she put that to work?

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:12.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she created a suitable setting

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reveal what was in her heart.

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
She invited him
to specially prepared banquets

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:22.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
with things she knew he would like,
including wine.

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when he was in a good mood,
she presented the problem

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right moment, and she had success.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:34.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So having that example in mind, the wise wife

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
will choose a time or create a setting

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
when her husband is relaxed

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:42.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she can speak respectfully

00:04:42.465 --> 00:04:45.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the situation.

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:49.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about the Christian husband
in this scenario?

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:53.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he knows the principle

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 3:7:

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You husbands, in the same way,

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:02.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“continue dwelling with them
according to knowledge.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel,
the feminine one.”

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he knows the principle

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:12.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know your wife’s limitations

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
—treat her considerately.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you find a Bible example

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:20.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a wise husband

00:05:20.837 --> 00:05:24.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
who put that principle to work
in a practical way?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s take a brief glance

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:29.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Genesis chapter 18.

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:33.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not going to read all of these verses,
but in verses 1-8,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
here’s the scenario.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three important visitors

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:41.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
show up unexpectedly at the tent of Abraham.

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:46.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
He invites them for a meal
—he says for just “a piece of bread.”

00:05:47.964 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did he leave it to Sarah
to figure out the menu?

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he arranges for an elaborate meal

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
consisting of freshly baked bread,

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:03.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
butter, milk, and choice tender meat.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he leave it to Sarah

00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:08.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do all the work?

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:11.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he did ask her to prepare the bread.

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Abraham was personally involved
in all the preparations,

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
even setting the table with the food

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and acting as a waiter.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after reviewing that account,
the husband sees the wisdom

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:30.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
of helping his wife
with the work involved in hosting guests,

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:34.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
including cleaning up afterward.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this husband

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:40.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
who knows his wife is overly stressed

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
might think of the principle too

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ephesians 5:25:

00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:49.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Husbands, continue loving your wives,

00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:52.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as the Christ

00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
also loved the congregation.”

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:57.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did Christ love the congregation?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:02.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he put that principle of love to work
with the disciples?

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one example.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look at Matthew 15:21,

00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:12.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read there: “Leaving there

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, probably Capernaum],

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus now went into the region
of Tyre and Sidon.”

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you may think to yourself:
‘Why is the Lord

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘going outside the boundaries,
or the borders, of Israel

00:07:26.762 --> 00:07:29.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘into Gentile territory?

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was assigned to Israel.’

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:38.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cross-reference you’ll see is Mark 7:24,

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:40.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it adds this:

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He rose up from there

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:45.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There he entered into a house

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:52.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and did not want anyone to know it,

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:54.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he could not escape notice.”

00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that seems
a little mysterious perhaps, at first.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does the Lord not want anyone to know

00:08:02.532 --> 00:08:05.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he was with the apostles?

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> has commented

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:10.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when comparing this account

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Mark 6:30, 31,

00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:16.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that not very long before

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:20.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus had told the apostles
that they should find

00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:24.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
an isolated place and rest up a little.

00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it never worked out

00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:30.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
because wherever Jesus went,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
the crowds followed him.

00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by going into Phoenicia

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
(outside the borders of Israel),

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:43.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
not letting anyone else know
where he was going,

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:46.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and taking the apostles with him,

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:51.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could get some much-needed rest.

00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:54.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see how Jesus

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
put the principle of love to work

00:08:57.853 --> 00:08:59.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way he treated his disciples.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:03.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wise husbands will do the same.

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:07.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are times,
really, during our busy lives

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we too, and especially our dear wives,

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:14.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to rest up a little.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even during this pandemic

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
when travel is limited,

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, let’s try to find a way

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some time away from our normal routine

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the two of you can rest up a little.

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:32.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in summary, as we go through our lives,

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s go on acquiring wisdom.

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:38.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we acquire knowledge of God’s Word

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:41.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how others
put that knowledge to work,

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can act wisely.
