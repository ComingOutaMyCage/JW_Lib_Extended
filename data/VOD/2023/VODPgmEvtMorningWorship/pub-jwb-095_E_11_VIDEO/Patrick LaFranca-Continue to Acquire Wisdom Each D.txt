00:00:00 The longer you live,
00:00:02 the more you realize that acquiring wisdom
00:00:06 is a lifelong process
00:00:08 —really, a daily one.
00:00:10 But let’s just analyze the process
00:00:13 of acquiring wisdom.
00:00:16 The basis for wisdom is knowledge,
00:00:20 so the first step is to acquire knowledge.
00:00:24 But wisdom isn’t just knowing a lot of things.
00:00:27 Our Insight  book under the subject “Knowledge” says this:
00:00:32 “Wisdom is the ability to put knowledge to work, or to use it,
00:00:37 “the intelligent application of learning.
00:00:40 “A person might have considerable knowledge
00:00:43 “but not know how to use it
00:00:46 “because of lacking wisdom.
00:00:48 “Jesus linked wisdom with accomplishment
00:00:51 “in saying: ‘Wisdom is proved righteous
00:00:54 by its works.’”
00:00:58 To illustrate, someone once said,
00:01:00 “Knowledge without wisdom
00:01:02 “is like having flour, eggs,
00:01:05 “butter, milk, and sugar
00:01:08 but not knowing how to put it all together to make a cake.”
00:01:13 So we might say
00:01:15 that in God’s Word, we have all the ingredients
00:01:19 —all the principles are there for wisdom.
00:01:24 We have to know how to put those principles together
00:01:27 —make the cake; the recipe is there.
00:01:31 Now, sometimes in recipes (most of the time, really),
00:01:34 they list all the ingredients and sometimes
00:01:38 even step-by-step procedures to make a cake.
00:01:43 You might think, ‘Well, I wish I could see
00:01:47 ‘an expert cook or baker
00:01:50 actually put those ingredients together.’
00:01:52 Well, interestingly today, on the Internet,
00:01:56 you have these videos with experts doing just that.
00:02:00 Well, in a way, that is what Jehovah
00:02:04 has done for us
00:02:06 because in the Bible,
00:02:08 we have not just principles
00:02:11 but we have accounts of people
00:02:13 putting those principles to work in their life.
00:02:19 They’re showing us how to make the cake, as it were.
00:02:23 Now, let’s take an example of a married couple
00:02:27 who might use accounts from the Bible to help them
00:02:30 see principles being put to work
00:02:34 —examples that will help them resolve a problem
00:02:38 that will preserve their peace and unity.
00:02:42 And I must add this disclaimer:
00:02:45 If the persons described in this scenario
00:02:48 resemble anyone you know,
00:02:51 it is plainly coincidental, as they say.
00:02:56 Now, here’s a wife, and she wants to raise an issue with her husband.
00:03:01 What’s the problem?
00:03:03 She feels stressed out.
00:03:05 Both of them work every day at their theocratic assignments.
00:03:08 The husband is very hospitable,
00:03:11 and he likes to invite people over for a meal.
00:03:15 Well, that’s nice.
00:03:17 She likes that too.
00:03:18 The problem is that she ends up doing all the work
00:03:22 —making the menu, preparing the meal, cleaning up afterward.
00:03:27 She’s stressed.
00:03:29 Now, she knows the principle
00:03:31 at Ecclesiastes 3:7
00:03:33 that there is “a time to keep quiet and a time to speak.”
00:03:38 Now, can she find an example in the Bible
00:03:42 of a wife who put that principle to work?
00:03:47 Ah, she thinks of Esther.
00:03:50 Remember Esther—Queen Esther.
00:03:53 In Esther chapter 5,
00:03:56 she had a very delicate problem to discuss with her husband, the king,
00:04:00 and she likely knew this principle
00:04:03 about “a time to speak.”
00:04:06 How did she put that to work?
00:04:08 Well, she created a suitable setting
00:04:12 to reveal what was in her heart.
00:04:14 She invited him to specially prepared banquets
00:04:17 with things she knew he would like, including wine.
00:04:22 And when he was in a good mood, she presented the problem
00:04:26 at the right moment, and she had success.
00:04:30 So having that example in mind, the wise wife
00:04:34 will choose a time or create a setting
00:04:36 when her husband is relaxed
00:04:38 and she can speak respectfully
00:04:42 about the situation.
00:04:45 Now, what about the Christian husband in this scenario?
00:04:50 Now, he knows the principle
00:04:53 at 1 Peter 3:7:
00:04:55 “You husbands, in the same way,
00:04:58 “continue dwelling with them according to knowledge.
00:05:02 Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one.”
00:05:06 So he knows the principle
00:05:09 to know your wife’s limitations
00:05:12 —treat her considerately.
00:05:15 Now, can you find a Bible example
00:05:18 of a wise husband
00:05:20 who put that principle to work in a practical way?
00:05:24 Well, let’s take a brief glance
00:05:26 in Genesis chapter 18.
00:05:29 We’re not going to read all of these verses, but in verses 1-8,
00:05:33 here’s the scenario.
00:05:35 Three important visitors
00:05:37 show up unexpectedly at the tent of Abraham.
00:05:42 He invites them for a meal —he says for just “a piece of bread.”
00:05:47 Well, did he leave it to Sarah to figure out the menu?
00:05:52 No, he arranges for an elaborate meal
00:05:55 consisting of freshly baked bread,
00:05:58 butter, milk, and choice tender meat.
00:06:03 Did he leave it to Sarah
00:06:05 to do all the work?
00:06:08 Well, he did ask her to prepare the bread.
00:06:11 But Abraham was personally involved in all the preparations,
00:06:16 even setting the table with the food
00:06:19 and acting as a waiter.
00:06:22 So after reviewing that account, the husband sees the wisdom
00:06:26 of helping his wife with the work involved in hosting guests,
00:06:30 including cleaning up afterward.
00:06:34 Now, this husband
00:06:37 who knows his wife is overly stressed
00:06:40 might think of the principle too
00:06:43 at Ephesians 5:25:
00:06:46 “Husbands, continue loving your wives,
00:06:49 “just as the Christ
00:06:52 also loved the congregation.”
00:06:54 Well, how did Christ love the congregation?
00:06:57 How did he put that principle of love to work with the disciples?
00:07:02 Here’s one example.
00:07:04 If you look at Matthew 15:21,
00:07:09 we read there: “Leaving there
00:07:12 “[that is, probably Capernaum],
00:07:14 Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.”
00:07:18 So you may think to yourself: ‘Why is the Lord
00:07:22 ‘going outside the boundaries, or the borders, of Israel
00:07:26 ‘into Gentile territory?
00:07:29 He was assigned to Israel.’
00:07:33 The cross-reference you’ll see is Mark 7:24,
00:07:38 and it adds this:
00:07:40 “He rose up from there
00:07:43 “and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
00:07:45 “There he entered into a house
00:07:48 “and did not want anyone to know it,
00:07:52 but he could not escape notice.”
00:07:54 Now, that seems a little mysterious perhaps, at first.
00:07:58 Why does the Lord not want anyone to know
00:08:02 where he was with the apostles?
00:08:05 The Watchtower  has commented
00:08:07 that when comparing this account
00:08:10 with Mark 6:30, 31,
00:08:14 we see that not very long before
00:08:16 Jesus had told the apostles that they should find
00:08:20 an isolated place and rest up a little.
00:08:25 Well, it never worked out
00:08:27 because wherever Jesus went,
00:08:30 the crowds followed him.
00:08:33 So by going into Phoenicia
00:08:35 (outside the borders of Israel),
00:08:38 not letting anyone else know where he was going,
00:08:43 and taking the apostles with him,
00:08:46 they could get some much-needed rest.
00:08:51 So we see how Jesus
00:08:54 put the principle of love to work
00:08:57 in the way he treated his disciples.
00:08:59 Wise husbands will do the same.
00:09:03 And there are times, really, during our busy lives
00:09:07 when we too, and especially our dear wives,
00:09:10 need to rest up a little.
00:09:14 Even during this pandemic
00:09:16 when travel is limited,
00:09:18 well, let’s try to find a way
00:09:22 —some time away from our normal routine
00:09:24 so the two of you can rest up a little.
00:09:29 So in summary, as we go through our lives,
00:09:32 let’s go on acquiring wisdom.
00:09:35 And as we acquire knowledge of God’s Word
00:09:38 and see how others put that knowledge to work,
00:09:41 we can act wisely.
