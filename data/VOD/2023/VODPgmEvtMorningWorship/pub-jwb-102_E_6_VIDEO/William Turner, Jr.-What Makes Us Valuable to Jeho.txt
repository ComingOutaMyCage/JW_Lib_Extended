00:00:01 What do you think makes us valuable
00:00:04 to Jehovah?
00:00:06 Is it our natural ability?
00:00:10 our many years of faithful service?
00:00:14 Is it our Bethel assignment?
00:00:17 Well, turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 3,
00:00:21 and we’ll let Jehovah answer this for us through his Word.
00:00:26 First Peter 3 and we’ll read verse 4:
00:00:34 “But let it be the secret person of the heart
00:00:39 “in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit,
00:00:43 which is of great value in the eyes of God.”
00:00:48 Now, of course, we know in the full context
00:00:50 of the opening verses here in 1 Peter chapter 3,
00:00:53 Peter is referring to Christian women.
00:00:56 But if we isolate this phrase in verse 4,
00:01:00 “the secret person of the heart,”
00:01:04 that applies to all of us, brothers and sisters,
00:01:08 because it’s referring to who we are on the inside
00:01:12 —our thoughts, our beliefs, our emotions.
00:01:18 That’s why David prayed at Psalm 51:10
00:01:21 for Jehovah to create within him “a pure heart,”
00:01:26 because that’s what Jehovah sees and examines,
00:01:30 that is what is valuable to him,
00:01:34 and that’s what all of us are striving to do —to serve him in that way.
00:01:39 And the beautiful thing is that when Jehovah sees
00:01:42 that we’re trying to serve him this way,
00:01:45 not only does that make us valuable to him
00:01:49 but he will also give us whatever we need
00:01:53 in whatever assignment we happen to have.
00:01:57 Now, just to prove this, let’s look at three different occasions
00:02:01 in various stages of David’s life,
00:02:05 all related to his assignment in warfare.
00:02:09 We’ll start with the account in 1 Samuel chapter 17.
00:02:15 When it was determined that David was going to fight Goliath,
00:02:20 you’ll recall that he was clothed with Saul’s armor.
00:02:24 Now, likely that was quite the privilege
00:02:26 —to fight with the king’s armor.
00:02:30 But notice the middle of verse 39.
00:02:32 After David tries it on, look at what happens:
00:02:36 “David said to Saul:
00:02:38 “‘I am unable to go in these things,
00:02:41 “for I am not used to them.’
00:02:43 So David took them off.”
00:02:46 So it was valuable armor,
00:02:49 but David wasn’t equipped to use it.
00:02:54 It didn’t fit him or his circumstances at the time.
00:02:58 But you notice David didn’t let that stop him.
00:03:03 Instead, he used what worked for him.
00:03:07 He looked for five smooth stones,
00:03:09 and with Jehovah’s help,
00:03:11 that was more than enough for him to carry out his assignment.
00:03:16 Perhaps we know of brothers and sisters,
00:03:19 maybe here at Bethel or in the field,
00:03:22 who at one time may have been hesitant to have a Bible study
00:03:26 or to engage in some other aspect of the ministry,
00:03:30 maybe because they felt they didn’t have the skill of a seasoned pioneer.
00:03:35 And yet they excelled,
00:03:38 and Jehovah blessed their efforts.
00:03:40 You see, they didn’t let that stop them.
00:03:43 They just worked with what they had
00:03:45 —their love for Jehovah, their sincerity—
00:03:49 and Jehovah blessed them.
00:03:52 The point is, because of our circumstances
00:03:55 we may not all have the experience, the training
00:03:59 —the figurative king’s armor, so to speak—
00:04:03 for a particular assignment,
00:04:05 but we still should not let that stop us
00:04:08 in our efforts to serve Jehovah.
00:04:11 We find what works for us.
00:04:13 And it may be that for a time we may feel that we’re just working
00:04:18 with a couple of figurative smooth stones.
00:04:22 But Jehovah says that is more than enough
00:04:24 for us to carry out our assignment.
00:04:28 Well, let’s consider the second occasion.
00:04:31 Sometime later, now David is trained, he’s skilled, and he’s quite the warrior.
00:04:36 And in 1 Samuel 18:4, he gets another privilege.
00:04:41 This time it’s to use the armor of Saul’s son, Jonathan.
00:04:46 And he’s successful.
00:04:48 He wins many battles.
00:04:50 To the point where, in verse 7, the women are celebrating:
00:04:55 “Saul has struck down his thousands,
00:04:57 and David his tens of thousands.”
00:05:01 Well, what makes David so successful?
00:05:05 One Watchtower  noted
00:05:07 that David’s “fighting was a matter of courage”
00:05:11 because he “repeatedly . . . inquired of Jehovah
00:05:14 “as to his moving into battle,
00:05:17 “showing that he was being guided by [Jehovah]
00:05:21 and not merely love of conquest.”
00:05:25 What can we take away from this?
00:05:28 Even if we’re privileged to do many things in the organization,
00:05:33 we should never let our intellect,
00:05:35 our privilege, our position, our natural abilities stop us
00:05:40 from seeking Jehovah’s direction first.
00:05:44 That can help us to maintain humility
00:05:47 —to keep us valuable to Jehovah.
00:05:51 I thought it was interesting that The Watchtower  also mentioned
00:05:53 one of the reasons that the women were able to sing
00:05:56 and celebrate David
00:05:58 was because of how David inspired his men in battle.
00:06:03 So, clearly, David must have worked well along with others.
00:06:08 He encouraged his men. He motivated them.
00:06:11 He brought out the best in them.
00:06:14 And together,
00:06:16 they were able to have many victories in behalf of Jehovah.
00:06:22 Well, isn’t that a nice reminder for family heads, congregation elders,
00:06:27 our overseers and crew leaders here at Bethel?
00:06:30 When we maintain the right disposition,
00:06:33 Jehovah can use us to inspire —to motivate—
00:06:37 and to encourage those whom we work with.
00:06:40 And then, together we can accomplish much
00:06:45 to Jehovah’s praise.
00:06:48 One final occasion,
00:06:50 this time in 2 Samuel.
00:06:54 At this point, David is now older.
00:06:57 He’s won many battles.
00:07:00 But in yet another war with the Philistines, notice what happens to him.
00:07:04 Notice 2 Samuel chapter 21.
00:07:12 In 2 Samuel 21, we’ll read verse 15.
00:07:18 It says: “Once again there was war between the Philistines and Israel.
00:07:23 “So David and his servants went down and fought the Philistines,
00:07:27 but David became exhausted.”
00:07:32 This time, David, even with his armor,
00:07:36 was in a situation that almost got him killed.
00:07:40 Now, the courage was still there,
00:07:43 but his strength wasn’t.
00:07:45 He was exhausted.
00:07:48 So in verse 17, how grateful he must have been
00:07:53 that men like Abishai had kept an eye on him
00:07:57 and quickly came to his aid.
00:08:00 If you go back a couple of chapters to chapter 18,
00:08:04 in verses 3 and 4, this matter of David going out to fight
00:08:08 had come up before.
00:08:10 But you notice when you look at those verses,
00:08:12 it was not as if the men were stopping David
00:08:15 from doing anything.
00:08:18 They just wanted him to do work
00:08:20 that fit his circumstances.
00:08:23 And in verse 4, we see the wisdom of David
00:08:26 in agreeing to do so.
00:08:30 Doesn’t this make us think of our dear, faithful older ones
00:08:34 in the family?
00:08:36 We love all of you so dearly.
00:08:38 We hold you in high esteem,
00:08:41 and we know that Jehovah treasures
00:08:44 and values you as well
00:08:47 because he sees your heart.
00:08:49 And he knows that your strength
00:08:51 may not be as it once was,
00:08:55 but your faith, your love,
00:08:58 your courage, your zeal
00:09:01 —it’s all there, and it’s as strong as ever.
00:09:05 So we’re so appreciative of our brotherhood and this Bethel family,
00:09:10 where we have members like Abishai
00:09:13 and where it’s such a privilege for them and us
00:09:16 to come to your aid and support you when we can.
00:09:21 And Jehovah certainly appreciates your willingness to do
00:09:24 whatever work you’re able to do as it fits your circumstances.
00:09:30 So, what a reminder it is to know
00:09:33 that it’s not our strength or natural ability
00:09:36 that draws us closer to Jehovah.
00:09:39 It’s that “secret person of the heart”
00:09:42 —a pure heart—
00:09:45 that makes us valuable to God.
00:09:47 And when we serve him in that way,
00:09:49 he will give us whatever we need,
00:09:51 regardless of our situation, or circumstances,
00:09:54 to always serve him in a way that he approves.
