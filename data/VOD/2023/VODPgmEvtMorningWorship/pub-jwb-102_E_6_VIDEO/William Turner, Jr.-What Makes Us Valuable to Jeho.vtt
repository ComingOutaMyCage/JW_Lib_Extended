00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:04.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
What do you think makes us valuable

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:06.356 line:10% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah?

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:10.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
Is it our natural ability?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.164 line:10% position:50% align:center
our many years of faithful service?

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:16.166 line:10% position:50% align:center
Is it our Bethel assignment?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, turn with me in your Bibles
to 1 Peter chapter 3,

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:26.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll let Jehovah answer this for us
through his Word.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 3 and we’ll read verse 4:

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:39.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But let it be the secret person of the heart

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the incorruptible adornment
of the quiet and mild spirit,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is of great value in the eyes of God.”

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course,
we know in the full context

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the opening verses
here in 1 Peter chapter 3,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter is referring to Christian women.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we isolate this phrase in verse 4,

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the secret person of the heart,”

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
that applies to all of us,
brothers and sisters,

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:12.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’s referring to who we are
on the inside

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:17.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our thoughts, our beliefs, our emotions.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:21.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why David prayed at Psalm 51:10

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:26.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah to create within him
“a pure heart,”

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that’s what Jehovah sees
and examines,

00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:34.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is what is valuable to him,

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s what all of us are striving to do
—to serve him in that way.

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:42.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the beautiful thing
is that when Jehovah sees

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re trying to serve him this way,

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only does that make us valuable to him

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he will also give us whatever we need

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:56.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
in whatever assignment we happen to have.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just to prove this,
let’s look at three different occasions

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
in various stages of David’s life,

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:09.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
all related to his assignment in warfare.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll start with the account
in 1 Samuel chapter 17.

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was determined
that David was going to fight Goliath,

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:24.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll recall that he was clothed
with Saul’s armor.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, likely that was quite the privilege

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:30.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to fight with the king’s armor.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice the middle of verse 39.

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
After David tries it on,
look at what happens:

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David said to Saul:

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am unable to go in these things,

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:43.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I am not used to them.’

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
So David took them off.”

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was valuable armor,

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
but David wasn’t equipped to use it.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t fit him or his circumstances
at the time.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:03.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you notice
David didn’t let that stop him.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:07.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he used what worked for him.

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:09.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looked for five smooth stones,

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with Jehovah’s help,

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:15.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was more than enough
for him to carry out his assignment.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we know of brothers and sisters,

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:22.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe here at Bethel or in the field,

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:26.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
who at one time may have been hesitant
to have a Bible study

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to engage
in some other aspect of the ministry,

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:34.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe because they felt they didn’t have
the skill of a seasoned pioneer.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet they excelled,

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed their efforts.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, they didn’t let that stop them.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just worked with what they had

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their love for Jehovah, their sincerity—

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed them.

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is, because of our circumstances

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may not all have
the experience, the training

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the figurative king’s armor, so to speak—

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a particular assignment,

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:08.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we still should not let that stop us

00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:11.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our efforts to serve Jehovah.

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:13.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find what works for us.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:18.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it may be that for a time
we may feel that we’re just working

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:22.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a couple of figurative smooth stones.

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:24.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah says that is more than enough

00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to carry out our assignment.

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider the second occasion.

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, now David is trained,
he’s skilled, and he’s quite the warrior.

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:41.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 1 Samuel 18:4,
he gets another privilege.

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:46.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time it’s to use
the armor of Saul’s son, Jonathan.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s successful.

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wins many battles.

00:04:50.673 --> 00:04:55.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the point where, in verse 7,
the women are celebrating:

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Saul has struck down his thousands,

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David his tens of thousands.”

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:05.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what makes David so successful?

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
One <i>Watchtower</i>  noted

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
that David’s “fighting
was a matter of courage”

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he “repeatedly . . .
inquired of Jehovah

00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as to his moving into battle,

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“showing that he was being guided
by [Jehovah]

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not merely love of conquest.”

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we take away from this?

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we’re privileged
to do many things in the organization,

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should never let our intellect,

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:40.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
our privilege, our position,
our natural abilities stop us

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:44.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
from seeking Jehovah’s direction first.

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can help us to maintain humility

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:51.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to keep us valuable to Jehovah.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:53.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it was interesting
that <i>The Watchtower</i>  also mentioned

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:56.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the reasons
that the women were able to sing

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and celebrate David

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
was because of how David
inspired his men in battle.

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, clearly, David must have worked well
along with others.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
He encouraged his men.
He motivated them.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brought out the best in them.

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
And together,

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were able to have many victories
in behalf of Jehovah.

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:27.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, isn’t that a nice reminder
for family heads, congregation elders,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
our overseers and crew leaders
here at Bethel?

00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we maintain the right disposition,

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can use us to inspire
—to motivate—

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to encourage
those whom we work with.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then,
together we can accomplish much

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s praise.

00:06:48.124 --> 00:06:50.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
One final occasion,

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time in 2 Samuel.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this point, David is now older.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s won many battles.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:04.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in yet another war with the Philistines,
notice what happens to him.

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:07.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice 2 Samuel chapter 21.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Samuel 21, we’ll read verse 15.

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:23.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Once again there was war
between the Philistines and Israel.

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So David and his servants went down
and fought the Philistines,

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:30.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
but David became exhausted.”

00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:36.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time, David, even with his armor,

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
was in a situation
that almost got him killed.

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:43.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the courage was still there,

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his strength wasn’t.

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:48.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was exhausted.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:53.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in verse 17,
how grateful he must have been

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
that men like Abishai
had kept an eye on him

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and quickly came to his aid.

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:04.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you go back a couple of chapters
to chapter 18,

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 3 and 4,
this matter of David going out to fight

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:10.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
had come up before.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:12.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you notice when you look at those verses,

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was not as if the men were stopping David

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
from doing anything.

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:20.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just wanted him to do work

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fit his circumstances.

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:26.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 4,
we see the wisdom of David

00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
in agreeing to do so.

00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:34.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t this make us think
of our dear, faithful older ones

00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:36.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the family?

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love all of you so dearly.

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:41.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hold you in high esteem,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know that Jehovah treasures

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and values you as well

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he sees your heart.

00:08:49.478 --> 00:08:51.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he knows that your strength

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not be as it once was,

00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:58.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
but your faith, your love,

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:01.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
your courage, your zeal

00:09:01.157 --> 00:09:05.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s all there,
and it’s as strong as ever.

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:10.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re so appreciative
of our brotherhood and this Bethel family,

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:13.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we have members like Abishai

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:16.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where it’s such a privilege
for them and us

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:21.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to your aid
and support you when we can.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah certainly appreciates
your willingness to do

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever work you’re able to do
as it fits your circumstances.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what a reminder it is to know

00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not our strength or natural ability

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:39.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
that draws us closer to Jehovah.

00:09:39.562 --> 00:09:42.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s that “secret person of the heart”

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a pure heart—

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
that makes us valuable to God.

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we serve him in that way,

00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:51.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will give us whatever we need,

00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:54.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of our situation,
or circumstances,

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:59.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always serve him
in a way that he approves.
