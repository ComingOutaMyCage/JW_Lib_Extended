00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.085 line:10% position:50% align:center
“If you have

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:05.221 line:10% position:50% align:center
“any word of encouragement . . . ,

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
tell it.”

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
Who said those words?

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.528 line:10% position:50% align:center
How or what did the apostle Paul

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:13.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
say in response?

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.732 line:10% position:50% align:center
How did his audience react?

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can Paul’s example teach us
about encouragement?

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Acts chapter 13.

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the account
of Paul’s first missionary tour.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a dangerous journey
of about 110 miles (180 km),

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:31.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul and his companions
find themselves seated

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a synagogue in Pisidian Antioch.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 15 says:

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After the public reading
of the Law and the Prophets,

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:44.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the presiding officers of the synagogue
sent word to them, saying:

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Men, brothers, if you have
any word of encouragement for the people,

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell it.’”

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:54.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the next five paragraphs
contain Paul’s speech.

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:56.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
How effective was it?

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 42-44 show the results.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the people begged Paul to come back
and give another talk the next weekend.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:09.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, many Jews and proselytes
became believers.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, on the following Sabbath,

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly all of the city turned out
to hear Paul’s next talk.

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:17.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to ask ourselves,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What did Paul say in those five paragraphs

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:25.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was so persuasive?’

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:28.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the first things we note
is his introduction

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 13:17:

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The God of this people Israel chose

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
our forefathers.”

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, note that inclusive pronoun “our”

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not your forefathers, not mine—
“our forefathers.”

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you realize that the last time
that little word was used in the book of Acts

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
was all the way back in chapter 7

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
during Stephen’s powerful speech?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stephen used the word “our” ten times,

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
usually in connection
with the word “forefathers.”

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:03.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul heard that speech
back when he was Saul of Tarsus.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, more than a decade later,
he himself uses the exact same expression

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:12.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the same purpose
—to establish common ground.

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Your ancestors are my ancestors.

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am what you are.’

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is the starting point
of true encouragement.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Watchtower</i>  article
from which our text is taken

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:28.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that “the Greek word
usually translated ‘encouragement’

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally means ‘a calling to one’s side.’”

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:35.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, yes, it’s related
to the Greek word for “comfort,”

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has a similar connotation.

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul began from their perspective:

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I know where you’re coming from.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up
learning the same holy writings as you.’

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verses 17-31,

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
he uses Jewish history and recent events

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prove that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:58.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in verses 32-37, he connects

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:02.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
current events with fulfilled prophecy

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
—prophecy that they knew.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do that today, don’t we?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
We go to the door; we read Matthew 24:7;
we ask: “What do you think?

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:13.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are the wars, famines, and earthquakes

00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:15.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we’ve seen in recent years
the same as ever

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:18.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
or are they a distinct fulfillment
of Bible prophecy?”

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:20.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the message?

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Jehovah is real; that Jehovah is alive;

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
his Word is coming true.

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:30.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, Paul went further, didn’t he?
He didn’t stop there.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 33, Paul said:

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God has completely fulfilled it

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
to us.”

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, this is personal.

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is at work in your life—in my life.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the big conclusion in verses 38-41.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:49.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, Jehovah did this for you;

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t miss out; you can succeed
with Jehovah’s help.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was Paul’s answer to a simple request

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a “word of encouragement.”

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:01.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Paul made disciples.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that how we’re counseled to fulfill

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:06.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
our student assignments today?

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen and encourage our audience,

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should show what Jehovah has done,

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he is doing, and what he will yet do.

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Paul’s speech was so persuasive
that it also drew persecution,

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
which followed him to the next two cities.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Lystra, his persecutors thought
they had killed him.

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:33.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Acts 14:20, 21 says

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “on the next day

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he left with Barnabas for Derbe.

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:43.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
After declaring the good news to that city
and making quite a few disciples,”

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
they faced a choice.

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:50.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see the choice on Map B13.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re looking at the red lines

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:54.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating Paul’s first missionary tour.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:58.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Derbe is the last stop,
but notice the next town over to the east

00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Tarsus.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:01.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sound familiar?

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul of Tarsus.

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a passageway from Derbe to Tarsus.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul would have known the road.

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:10.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used it on his second missionary journey

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his third missionary journey,
but not this time.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 14:21
—and the red arrows show that Paul returned

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all three cities
where he had been persecuted,

00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:24.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Pisidian Antioch,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he first received the request
for a “word of encouragement.”

00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:30.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? Why return?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would have been so easy for him to think:
‘You know, we’ve had a pretty good run here.

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I helped the ruler of Cyprus into the truth.

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:39.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I performed my first miracle,
striking Elymas blind.

00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:43.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We started new congregations
in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe.

00:05:43.793 --> 00:05:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I endured all manner of hardships.

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I was beaten up and stoned
and left for dead.

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:52.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a successful missionary tour,
but I need to regroup.’

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. He didn’t think that way.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:05:56.806 --> 00:05:59.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the needs of the congregation

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:03.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
outweighed his own personal feelings

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fears.

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:10.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you suppose that the opposers
who stoned him and left him for dead

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:15.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
were any kinder
to the new disciples in Lystra?

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides, who was taking the lead?

00:06:17.493 --> 00:06:19.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul needed to appoint overseers.

00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:22.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a weighty task.

00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:24.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
So back they went.

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:28.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise today, our brothers
are putting the needs of the disciples

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:31.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of their own comforts.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember these scenes

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
from <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses—Faith in Action,</i>
<i>Part 2: Let the Light Shine?</i>

00:06:37.613 --> 00:06:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Pillars explains
that when he refused

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
to salute the flag in Winnsboro, Texas,

00:06:43.386 --> 00:06:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was beaten up and hanged.

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, the rope broke,
and he survived to tell the story.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
What the video doesn’t tell us
is that Oscar Pillars was a circuit overseer.

00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:59.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some months later,
guess where it was time for him to return?

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Winnsboro, Texas.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the months
since the hanging incident,

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers hadn’t been preaching downtown
—they were preaching in the rurals.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Pillars reasoned
that if he didn’t preach downtown,

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers may never get the courage
to preach there.

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he checked out all the territories
within the city limits.

00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:22.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
They worked there all morning and had
a beautiful time with no negative incidents,

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
except at the very last door.

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman said, “Say,

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
aren’t you?”

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “Yes, ma’am, I am.”

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “You know,
we hanged one of you people here,

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll do it again.”

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he didn’t tell her
that he was the one that they hanged.

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a beautiful example
of standing with your brothers

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and putting their needs

00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of your own feelings!

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:55.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have to say that this Bethel family

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not self-sparing

00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:00.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
when encouragement is needed.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, though, it could be easy to think,

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:06.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, I just don’t know what to say.’

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is saying something always necessary?

00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you suppose those in Lystra felt

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:16.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to see Paul again,

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing what it must have taken
for him emotionally

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:22.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply to return?

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:26.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
That of itself spoke volumes.

00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘OK, but I still feel
like I should say something.’

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul say?

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:34.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 22: “We must enter
into the Kingdom of God

00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:37.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
through many tribulations.”

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom—words of true encouragement

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:43.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
always center on the Kingdom.

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:45.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not like Job’s false comforters:

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:47.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Clearly, you have problems here.
You must be doing something wrong.’

00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:51.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, rather: ‘You’re imitating Jesus.

00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:54.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It brought the wrath of our enemy.
Well done!

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And that you’re willing to suffer
proves that this is real.

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You will see Jehovah back you up now.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You will see him reward you in the future.

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:05.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stick with it!’

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:08.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you been called on to offer

00:09:08.497 --> 00:09:11.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “word of encouragement”?

00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:15.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t over think it, just go!

00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stand beside those who need you.

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:21.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you have

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
any words of encouragement for the people,
“tell it.”
