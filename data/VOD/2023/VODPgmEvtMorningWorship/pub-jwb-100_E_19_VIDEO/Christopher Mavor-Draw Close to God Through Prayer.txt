00:00:01 Now, our text today
00:00:03 really brings to our attention
00:00:05 the close attention and affection
00:00:09 that our God, Jehovah, has for each of us,
00:00:12 especially when we’re living
00:00:14 under extreme or stressful times.
00:00:17 And this is really brought home to us;
00:00:19 the fact that under inspiration,
00:00:22 the apostle Paul was moved to write to the Ephesian congregation
00:00:26 these beautiful words of our text today.
00:00:29 And why?
00:00:31 Because that congregation was under an extreme amount of pressure
00:00:35 from the world around them.
00:00:37 The city of Ephesus was very materialistic.
00:00:40 It was wealthy,
00:00:42 and it was just steeped in spiritism and demonism.
00:00:47 The culture was based upon the religion
00:00:50 of false gods, such as Artemis.
00:00:53 In fact, they boasted that they had
00:00:56 the great temple of Artemis in Ephesus,
00:00:58 which is considered to be one of the seven wonders
00:01:01 of the ancient world.
00:01:03 And so Ephesus was a tourist destination,
00:01:06 and many made their wealth in money
00:01:08 from selling a religious article such as idols
00:01:12 to those that would come there to worship.
00:01:15 This type of worship fostered immorality and crime,
00:01:19 since within that temple arrangement,
00:01:21 no one could be charged with any kind of crime.
00:01:25 And of course, it fostered immoral thinking and activities.
00:01:30 So any time our brothers went out to work or school,
00:01:34 they were facing, or dealing with, this intense pressure
00:01:37 from a culture that was in sharp contrast to doing God’s will.
00:01:43 They stood in danger
00:01:45 of violating or having their Christian integrity compromised.
00:01:49 Well, now, this all sounds very familiar to us
00:01:52 because we are living deep in the time of the end.
00:01:54 In fact, the world is in an Ephesuslike condition.
00:01:57 In fact, even worse, “because the Devil
00:01:59 has come down to [the earth], having great anger.”
00:02:01 And he wants to destroy us all,
00:02:03 especially we who are God’s people.
00:02:06 So, therefore, we need to pay very close attention
00:02:09 to the the counsel, the loving counsel, that Jehovah gave to the Ephesians.
00:02:13 And he preserved it for our day
00:02:15 because we need to pay close attention
00:02:19 to what Jehovah told the Ephesians
00:02:22 to preserve them alive there in that time, their spiritual lives,
00:02:26 and how important it is for us today.
00:02:28 Now, in reviewing this counsel,
00:02:31 if you want to open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 6,
00:02:35 we definitely get the impression, or the feeling,
00:02:37 that this is a loving heavenly Father
00:02:41 talking to his children.
00:02:43 Notice right away in verse 11
00:02:46 what Jehovah tells all of us to do.
00:02:49 He says to “put on the complete suit of armor from God
00:02:53 so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil.”
00:02:57 Now, what does this sound like to you?
00:03:00 For me, it reminds me of a parent talking to a child
00:03:04 before he goes out when the weather is bad,
00:03:06 and he says, “Put on your coat.”
00:03:08 In fact, he helps them put on his coat and puts a hat on his child
00:03:11 and makes sure his gloves are on and puts his boots on
00:03:14 and all the time talking:
00:03:16 “We want you to stay warm and safe and dry
00:03:19 “because we don’t want you to get sick.
00:03:22 We want you to be safe and healthy.”
00:03:25 And I can remember with my own mom
00:03:27 when she would dress me up before I went out the door,
00:03:29 she would always slip some change in my pocket.
00:03:31 It was back in the days of pay phones.
00:03:34 And she said: “You know, any time you feel you’re stuck
00:03:37 “or you’re in trouble, you give me a call.
00:03:40 I’m just a phone call away.”
00:03:43 Well, in many ways, Jehovah is like this loving parent.
00:03:48 He dresses us up to face the spiritual battles of our day.
00:03:53 But he goes even further to show his personal concern.
00:03:57 And this is where our text for today comes in.
00:03:59 In verse 18 it says:
00:04:01 “With every form of prayer and supplication
00:04:04 “you carry on prayer on every occasion
00:04:09 in spirit.”
00:04:12 Yes, the days are very wicked,
00:04:15 and Jehovah knows that there are things that we’re going to be faced with
00:04:19 that we need to talk to him about.
00:04:22 But it’s not just the things that are of great, serious concern.
00:04:26 No, there are things that, all things in life,
00:04:30 he wants us to talk to him about.
00:04:33 And why is that?
00:04:35 It’s interesting what the Insight  volume has to say
00:04:37 in Insight,  Volume 2, under the subject of “Prayer.”
00:04:41 In talking about our personal prayers to Jehovah,
00:04:44 it made this comment.
00:04:45 It says: “Personal prayers . . . may embrace
00:04:48 virtually every facet of life.”
00:04:52 But for our prayers to be heard,
00:04:54 we must be wholly “on God’s side
00:04:57 in the issue involving Jehovah’s sovereignty.”
00:05:01 Now, this is in keeping with the spirit of the model prayer
00:05:04 that Jesus taught us to pray.
00:05:07 Embodied in that prayer
00:05:09 were all things that are important to a Christian’s life.
00:05:13 And what is of foremost importance to us?
00:05:17 It’s the sanctification of God’s name
00:05:20 and that God’s will be done by means of his Kingdom.
00:05:25 As dedicated servants of Jehovah God,
00:05:29 this is what our life is all about.
00:05:33 Our daily life involves
00:05:36 this matter of Jehovah’s name and the Kingdom.
00:05:40 It’s tied up in our Christian integrity
00:05:42 of upholding Jehovah’s name and the Kingdom interests.
00:05:46 And that’s why Jehovah says, ‘Pray on every occasion.’
00:05:51 And what he’s telling us is that “everything in your life involves me.
00:05:56 “I gave my Son for you.
00:05:59 “I want to hear what’s going on in your life.
00:06:01 “I want to be a part of your life.
00:06:04 “You are important to me. You’re my fellow worker.
00:06:07 You’re helping me accomplish my will and purpose.”
00:06:12 Therefore, we should never hold back
00:06:15 from praying to Jehovah
00:06:17 even about minor things that may come up.
00:06:21 And why?
00:06:23 Because communication is the lifeblood of a strong relationship,
00:06:27 especially with Jehovah God.
00:06:29 Again, we go back to the illustration of children.
00:06:31 You know, a child will sit there and just talk and talk
00:06:34 and talk and talk about all kinds of things,
00:06:36 maybe even seemingly insignificant things.
00:06:39 But a parent listens to them with a smile on his face.
00:06:43 They’re overjoyed because they’re hearing what the child thinks, what’s on his heart.
00:06:47 But it also is an opportunity to establish
00:06:50 good lines of communication with that child
00:06:53 and establish a loving bond with him
00:06:57 to hear his innermost thoughts.
00:07:00 Does Jehovah hear our innermost thoughts?
00:07:03 Does he hear times of joy, why we’re so happy,
00:07:08 expressing gratitude for a beautiful day,
00:07:12 a starry night, a shooting star, beavers on the lake?
00:07:16 Such prayers are not just chatter to Jehovah God,
00:07:21 but it’s what endears us to him.
00:07:24 This establishes a strong line of communication with Jehovah God
00:07:29 that we need during these critical last days.
00:07:34 Jesus says that every day
00:07:37 we have anxieties and problems.
00:07:41 We have to deal with our own imperfect flesh
00:07:45 that can cause us great distress, among other things.
00:07:49 But notice what the sons of Korah said
00:07:52 in Psalm 46:1, under inspiration.
00:07:56 Notice how they felt about Jehovah; it says:
00:07:58 “God is our refuge and strength,
00:08:01 a help that is readily found in times of distress.”
00:08:07 In times of distress, we need to go to Jehovah God,
00:08:10 and if we’ve been talking to him about every little thing in our life,
00:08:13 well, that line of communication is immediate.
00:08:16 We go to him without hesitation.
00:08:19 We reveal to him what is causing us pain in our hearts,
00:08:23 our innermost thoughts,
00:08:25 dealing with our imperfections and sinful nature.
00:08:28 You know this is where the disciple James
00:08:31 under inspiration at James 4:8 tells us during these times:
00:08:36 “Draw close to God
00:08:38 “and he will draw close to you.
00:08:43 Cleanse your hands, you sinners.”
00:08:46 We think back to the stress of our brothers in Ephesus.
00:08:50 They walked out the door and perhaps maybe they heard something,
00:08:53 they saw something that brought back to their minds
00:08:55 an improper thought or a feeling that they thought they had licked
00:09:00 —that they thought they had gotten control of—
00:09:02 and there it is rearing its ugly head.
00:09:05 They went to Jehovah in prayer. They talked to him about that.
00:09:09 Does the same thing happen to us?
00:09:11 Of course it does. We’re imperfect.
00:09:14 Our hearts are always leaning toward what is bad.
00:09:18 And so we need to lean on Jehovah God
00:09:21 to pray to him, to let him know how we feel,
00:09:23 and to express our thoughts
00:09:25 so that “we [can bring] every thought into captivity
00:09:29 [and] make it obedient to the Christ”.
00:09:32 See, prayer can make that happen.
00:09:35 Jehovah can help us to remove those thoughts and bring them under control
00:09:39 so they do not affect our peace and our joy in our heart.
00:09:45 Jehovah truly is our loving Father,
00:09:47 and he’s greatly concerned for each and every one of us.
00:09:51 And he wants to help us.
00:09:53 He wants to be part of our life so that we can be successful
00:09:57 in fighting “the fine fight [for] the faith”
00:09:59 and maintaining our integrity to him each and every day.
00:10:05 Therefore, let this day be another day
00:10:09 in which our precious relationship with Jehovah God is strengthened
00:10:13 because we have gone to him on every occasion in prayer.
