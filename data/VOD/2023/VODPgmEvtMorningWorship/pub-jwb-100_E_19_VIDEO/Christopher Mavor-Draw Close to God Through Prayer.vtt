00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:03.586 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, our text today

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:05.922 line:10% position:50% align:center
really brings to our attention

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:09.192 line:10% position:50% align:center
the close attention and affection

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:12.395 line:10% position:50% align:center
that our God, Jehovah, has for each of us,

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:14.397 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially when we’re living

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:17.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
under extreme or stressful times.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is really brought home to us;

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fact that under inspiration,

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:26.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul was moved
to write to the Ephesian congregation

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
these beautiful words of our text today.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why?

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:35.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that congregation
was under an extreme amount of pressure

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the world around them.

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:40.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city of Ephesus was very materialistic.

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was wealthy,

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:47.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was just steeped
in spiritism and demonism.

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
The culture was based upon the religion

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
of false gods, such as Artemis.

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, they boasted that they had

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:58.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
the great temple of Artemis in Ephesus,

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is considered to be
one of the seven wonders

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the ancient world.

00:01:03.413 --> 00:01:06.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Ephesus was a tourist destination,

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:08.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many made their wealth in money

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
from selling a religious article
such as idols

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those that would come there to worship.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
This type of worship
fostered immorality and crime,

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
since within that temple arrangement,

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
no one could be charged
with any kind of crime.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:30.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course,
it fostered immoral thinking and activities.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
So any time our brothers
went out to work or school,

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were facing, or dealing with,
this intense pressure

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:42.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a culture that was in sharp contrast
to doing God’s will.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stood in danger

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
of violating or having
their Christian integrity compromised.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now,
this all sounds very familiar to us

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we are living deep
in the time of the end.

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
the world is in an Ephesuslike condition.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
even worse, “because the Devil

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
has come down to [the earth],
having great anger.”

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he wants to destroy us all,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially we who are God’s people.

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:09.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, therefore,
we need to pay very close attention

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the the counsel, the loving counsel,
that Jehovah gave to the Ephesians.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he preserved it for our day

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:19.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we need to pay close attention

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what Jehovah told the Ephesians

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preserve them alive there in that time,
their spiritual lives,

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how important it is for us today.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:31.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in reviewing this counsel,

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you want to open your Bibles
to Ephesians chapter 6,

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
we definitely get the impression,
or the feeling,

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:41.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is a loving heavenly Father

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking to his children.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:46.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice right away in verse 11

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah tells all of us to do.

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says to “put on the complete suit
of armor from God

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:57.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you may be able to stand firm
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does this sound like to you?

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me, it reminds me
of a parent talking to a child

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he goes out when the weather is bad,

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he says, “Put on your coat.”

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he helps them put on his coat
and puts a hat on his child

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and makes sure his gloves are on
and puts his boots on

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the time talking:

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:19.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We want you to stay warm and safe and dry

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because we don’t want you to get sick.

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:25.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want you to be safe and healthy.”

00:03:25.388 --> 00:03:27.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I can remember with my own mom

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she would dress me up
before I went out the door,

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:31.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would always slip
some change in my pocket.

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was back in the days of pay phones.

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said:
“You know, any time you feel you’re stuck

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or you’re in trouble, you give me a call.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just a phone call away.”

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:48.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in many ways,
Jehovah is like this loving parent.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
He dresses us up to face
the spiritual battles of our day.

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:57.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he goes even further
to show his personal concern.

00:03:57.353 --> 00:03:59.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is where
our text for today comes in.

00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:01.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 18 it says:

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With every form
of prayer and supplication

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:09.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you carry on prayer on every occasion

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spirit.”

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:15.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the days are very wicked,

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah knows that there are things
that we’re going to be faced with

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to talk to him about.

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:26.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not just the things
that are of great, serious concern.

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:30.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, there are things that,
all things in life,

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wants us to talk to him about.

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:35.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:04:35.224 --> 00:04:37.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting
what the <i>Insight</i>  volume has to say

00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
in <i>Insight,</i>  Volume 2,
under the subject of “Prayer.”

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
In talking about our personal prayers
to Jehovah,

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
it made this comment.

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:48.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Personal prayers . . . may embrace

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
virtually every facet of life.”

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:54.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for our prayers to be heard,

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:57.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be wholly “on God’s side

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the issue
involving Jehovah’s sovereignty.”

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:04.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is in keeping
with the spirit of the model prayer

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus taught us to pray.

00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:09.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Embodied in that prayer

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
were all things
that are important to a Christian’s life.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is of foremost importance to us?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the sanctification of God’s name

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:24.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that God’s will be done
by means of his Kingdom.

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:29.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
As dedicated servants of Jehovah God,

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is what our life is all about.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our daily life involves

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
this matter of Jehovah’s name
and the Kingdom.

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:42.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s tied up in our Christian integrity

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:46.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
of upholding Jehovah’s name
and the Kingdom interests.

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why Jehovah says,
‘Pray on every occasion.’

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what he’s telling us
is that “everything in your life involves me.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I gave my Son for you.

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I want to hear what’s going on in your life.

00:06:01.978 --> 00:06:04.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I want to be a part of your life.

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are important to me.
You’re my fellow worker.

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re helping me accomplish
my will and purpose.”

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we should never hold back

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
from praying to Jehovah

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:21.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
even about minor things that may come up.

00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:23.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why?

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:27.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because communication
is the lifeblood of a strong relationship,

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially with Jehovah God.

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we go back
to the illustration of children.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:34.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, a child will sit there
and just talk and talk

00:06:34.343 --> 00:06:36.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talk and talk about all kinds of things,

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:39.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe even seemingly insignificant things.

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a parent listens to them
with a smile on his face.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:47.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re overjoyed because they’re hearing
what the child thinks, what’s on his heart.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it also is an opportunity to establish

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
good lines of communication with that child

00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and establish a loving bond with him

00:06:57.433 --> 00:06:59.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear his innermost thoughts.

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:03.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah hear our innermost thoughts?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he hear times of joy,
why we’re so happy,

00:07:08.444 --> 00:07:12.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressing gratitude for a beautiful day,

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:16.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
a starry night, a shooting star,
beavers on the lake?

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:21.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such prayers are not just chatter
to Jehovah God,

00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s what endears us to him.

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
This establishes a strong line
of communication with Jehovah God

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:33.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need during these critical last days.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus says that every day

00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:40.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have anxieties and problems.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to deal with our own imperfect flesh

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:49.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can cause us great distress,
among other things.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what the sons of Korah said

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:56.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 46:1, under inspiration.

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how they felt about Jehovah;
it says:

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is our refuge and strength,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:06.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
a help that is readily found
in times of distress.”

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
In times of distress,
we need to go to Jehovah God,

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:13.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if we’ve been talking to him
about every little thing in our life,

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:16.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, that line of communication
is immediate.

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:19.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
We go to him without hesitation.

00:08:19.982 --> 00:08:23.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
We reveal to him
what is causing us pain in our hearts,

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:25.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
our innermost thoughts,

00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:28.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with our imperfections
and sinful nature.

00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know this is where the disciple James

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
under inspiration at James 4:8
tells us during these times:

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:38.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Draw close to God

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:43.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will draw close to you.

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cleanse your hands, you sinners.”

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:50.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think back
to the stress of our brothers in Ephesus.

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
They walked out the door
and perhaps maybe they heard something,

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:55.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
they saw something
that brought back to their minds

00:08:55.751 --> 00:09:00.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
an improper thought or a feeling
that they thought they had licked

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:02.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that they thought
they had gotten control of—

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:04.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there it is rearing its ugly head.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went to Jehovah in prayer.
They talked to him about that.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the same thing happen to us?

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:14.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course it does.
We’re imperfect.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:18.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hearts are always leaning
toward what is bad.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we need to lean on Jehovah God

00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:23.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pray to him,
to let him know how we feel,

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to express our thoughts

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:29.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that “we [can bring]
every thought into captivity

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:32.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
[and] make it obedient to the Christ”.

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, prayer can make that happen.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:39.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can help us to remove those thoughts
and bring them under control

00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they do not affect our peace
and our joy in our heart.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah truly is our loving Father,

00:09:47.903 --> 00:09:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s greatly concerned
for each and every one of us.

00:09:51.107 --> 00:09:53.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he wants to help us.

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:57.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to be part of our life
so that we can be successful

00:09:57.146 --> 00:09:59.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
in fighting “the fine fight [for] the faith”

00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:04.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintaining our integrity
to him each and every day.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, let this day be another day

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which our precious relationship
with Jehovah God is strengthened

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:17.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have gone to him
on every occasion in prayer.
