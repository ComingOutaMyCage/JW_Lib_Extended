00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:03.887 line:10% position:50% align:center
So our Scripture text for today

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:06.222 line:10% position:50% align:center
discusses the qualities needed

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:08.258 line:10% position:50% align:center
“to walk worthily”

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
and in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:13.830 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice our Scripture text,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:1, is only a partial sentence.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:21.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the entire sentence,
which takes in verses 1-3.

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:1-3—he says:

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appeal to you to walk worthily
of the calling with which you were called,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with all humility
and mildness, with patience,

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“putting up with one another in love,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“earnestly endeavoring
to maintain the oneness of the spirit

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the uniting bond of peace.”

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:49.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here the apostle Paul
links ‘walking worthily’ with unity,

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you notice the qualities
that are needed to do that.

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says that we need ‘humility,
mildness, and patience.’

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is not the only time
that the apostle Paul

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
links these three qualities
with being in unity.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:05.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may remember Colossians 3:12,

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it tells us
to “clothe [ourselves] with . . .

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility, mildness, and patience.”

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that we can
“continue putting up with one another.”

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why are these qualities
so essential to peace and to unity?

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:21.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do the Scriptures say about them?

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps we think of the scripture

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 2:3, 4, which says:

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:31.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that brings about peace and unity.

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:37.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Proverbs 15:1:

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A mild answer turns away rage.”

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Proverbs 25:15:

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By patience a commander is won over.”

00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, humility, mildness, patience

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:52.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these qualities are so vital

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
for taking tension out of a situation

00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowing for humility
and unity and peace.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are many accounts in the Bible
that illustrate this fact,

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:05.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to consider just one

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that of the Ephraimites and Gideon.

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:11.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look in your Bibles
in Judges chapters 6 and 7,

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:16.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
it sets out the account
of Gideon going against the Midianites.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember that
in response to Jehovah’s direction,

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon won against Midian

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:23.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
—first with 32,000 men

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then finally weeded down
to only 300 men.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you look in your Bibles,
the <i>Study Bible</i>  map B6 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to visualize the strategy

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:35.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Gideon used with Jehovah’s direction.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Midianites

00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:40.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
gathered near the hill of Moreh,

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:42.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can see that here on the map.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you look at Judges 6:34,

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:47.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re reminded

00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jehovah’s spirit came upon Gideon.”

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here he’s operating
under Jehovah’s spirit.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did he do?

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
First off, he calls
on the tribes of Manasseh,

00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:00.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to assist.

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:01.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that makes sense

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you can see where those tribes were

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
in relation to where the fighting was going to be.

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then at Judges 7:22,

00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:10.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon’s initial attack

00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:12.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
threw the Midianites into confusion.

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:13.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the Midianites

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:17.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
fled south toward Abel-meholah.

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 23 of chapter 7 says

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he then calls on Naphtali,

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asher, and Manasseh

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
to chase after them and push them

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the south, further south.

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:29.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can see the logic in that.

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:32.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then in an excellent strategy

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 24 and 25, to head them off,

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
he also calls on Ephraim

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
to capture the waters as far as Beth-barah

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:42.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and block their escape, and they do.

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re successful;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two main princes of Midian are killed.

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s victory
—an excellent strategy—

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the greatest and most courageous

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bravest battles in the Bible.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, interestingly,

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no record ever again

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Midianites bothering Jehovah’s people

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:02.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
after this victory.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine having a share in that project,

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
how excited you would be?

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:09.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, not everybody was.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Judges 8:1;

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Then the men of Ephraim
said to him [to Gideon]:

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What have you done to us?

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why did you not call us
when you went to fight against Midian?’

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:25.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they quarreled bitterly with him.”

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Ephraim’s problem?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they felt they
should have been involved earlier

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that perhaps the situation
should have been handled differently.

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why weren’t we involved?
Why didn’t you call us?

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:37.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We didn’t know anything that was going on.

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we had to drop everything
and come and bail you out.’

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:44.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did Ephraim
have humility, mildness, and patience?

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, far from it.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was disrupting unity.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did Gideon respond?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we remember,
Gideon had Jehovah’s spirit

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:55.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had an excellent strategy

00:04:55.812 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to an outstanding victory
for Jehovah.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:04:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he respond?

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at verses 2 and 3.

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “But he said to them:
‘What have I done compared with you?

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:11.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are not the gleanings of Ephraim
better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:13.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was into your hand

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:17.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that God gave Midian’s princes
Oreb and Zeeb,

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what have I done compared with you?’

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he spoke this way, they calmed down.”

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:26.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Gideon showed humility,

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:28.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
mildness, and patience.

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone calmed down,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gideon was able
to get on with Jehovah’s work at hand.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:39.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we contrast that to the next time
that the Ephraimites pulled the same trick,

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:42.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in Judges chapter 12.

00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:44.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you remember
that they accused Jephthah

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
of not calling them into battle—same story.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jephthah do?

00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he says:
‘Well, I did call you into battle,

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:52.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you didn’t come,
so I just did it myself.’

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next thing you know,
they’re fighting among themselves,

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:58.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely distracted
from carrying on Jehovah’s work.

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:00.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:03.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the lesson is
that things happen at times

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:06.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make peace go away.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes brothers in the congregation,

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Bethel, on a construction site

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
may react like Ephraimites.

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:18.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we react like Ephraimites.

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:20.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why didn’t you ask my opinion?

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:22.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I was supposed to be involved in this.

00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:25.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why did you call me last minute when
you knew you needed this two weeks ago,

00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:27.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now I have to drop everything
and help you out.’

00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:30.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that happens; we’re only human.

00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:34.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when it happens, how will we react?

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:39.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, unity is more important
than who is right and who is wrong,

00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:42.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gideon understood that simple truth.

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:46.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
And unity is so important today.

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:48.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was an interesting,
beautiful <i>Watchtower</i>  article

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:52.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2014, December 15,
and the article was entitled

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:55.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Facing the End of This Old World Together.”

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:58.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it stated this; it said:

00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:02.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One of the darkest periods
in human history nears. . . .

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:06.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
For God’s people,
it will be a time for unity.”

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:07.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
It goes on to say:

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During the coming
time of trouble for this system,

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:13.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will have to be truly united.”

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:16.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let me ask you,

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think it’s any coincidence

00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:20.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
that here,
where we are in the stream of time,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we see Jehovah pulling his organization

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
closer and closer together in unity?

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:29.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it any coincidence
that we hear over and over again

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the need for peace and for unity?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:32.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, as this world
gets more and more divided,

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:37.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
fragmented, fighting,

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:41.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to pull
tighter and tighter together in unity.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that requires that all of us

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:45.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
work on these beautiful qualities

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
of humility, mildness, and patience.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when there’s a lack of unity,
what do we have to do?

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:53.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have to look at ourselves.

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, generally we find

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the problem is me; it’s us.

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:03.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we weren’t consulted
as soon as we should have been.

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:07.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe our idea of how the work
or this thing should be done

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:09.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t shared by others.

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:13.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the grand scheme of things,
does it really make a difference?

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many times
when we look at a situation afterward

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we pull back unemotionally,

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
we generally find that, well,
maybe our idea was pretty good,

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the timing wasn’t good.

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it wasn’t
that great of an idea after all.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:31.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe there was more than one way
for this thing to be handled.

00:08:31.327 --> 00:08:34.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps Jehovah’s spirit

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
was leading things in a different direction.

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, again, what can help us
to not be an obstacle to unity?

00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility, mildness, patience

00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:47.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just what we were considering
in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:08:47.143 --> 00:08:49.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we have to have the confidence

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if it’s important to Jehovah,
it’ll happen.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if not, what a shame it would be

00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become an obstacle to unity

00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:01.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
over something
that’s not that important to Jehovah!

00:09:01.724 --> 00:09:05.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, brothers and sisters,
we need the “Gideons”

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:09.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us
in our support of the Governing Body.

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:11.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon was such a beautiful example.

00:09:11.334 --> 00:09:14.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once he understood Jehovah’s direction,

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was willing to run into the fire
for Jehovah and for his organization.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we need.
We need “Gideons.”

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:24.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t need any more “Ephraimites.”

00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in harmony with today’s text,

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:30.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
may each one of us walk worthily
in these last days

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:34.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
and work on the qualities
of humility, mildness, and patience.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do,
we will be a uniting force for good

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:43.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of Gideonlike value
to Jehovah and the organization

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the troublesome days ahead.
