00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
A discussion of riches

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:05.777 line:10% position:50% align:center
often centers on the danger

00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:07.987 line:10% position:50% align:center
of making material wealth

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:10.532 line:10% position:50% align:center
the main thing in our life.

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:12.993 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our text today is about riches,

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:16.747 line:10% position:50% align:center
but the focus is on how we use

00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:18.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things that we possess.

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:23.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to our text at Luke 16:9
and read it once again.

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:26.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“Also, I say to you:

00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make friends for yourselves
by means of the unrighteous riches,

00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:33.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that when such fail,

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may receive you
into the everlasting dwelling places.”

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are certain aspects of this text

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:44.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some have found difficult to understand.

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:46.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:48.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would a Christian even be in possession

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:52.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
of unrighteous riches?

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:56.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who are referred to by the pronoun “they”?

00:00:56.874 --> 00:01:01.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, what application
is there in this illustration for us?

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:06.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
To clarify matters,
it will help us to look at the context.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 1 through 8
of Luke chapter 16

00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:14.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
contain the illustration
of the steward and the unrighteous riches.

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 9 to 13

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:20.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
provide the application of the illustration.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that application includes the principles

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:27.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘the person faithful in least
is faithful in much’

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:32.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also that we “cannot slave for God
and for Riches.”

00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:36.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
To learn how we can benefit
from this teaching of Jesus,

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s consider three things.

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:43.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
we will examine the illustration.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we will identify the elements.

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, we’ll make the application.

00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:55.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first of all,
let’s examine the illustration.

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:59.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at Luke 16:1,
it talks about a steward.

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:04.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at the footnote,
it says this could be a “house manager.”

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:08.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it is someone who’s entrusted
with a good deal of responsibility.

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it says that he is accused

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
of handling his master’s “goods wastefully.”

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the wording of that verse

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows for the possibility
that the steward was slandered.

00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:25.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible the charges were false.

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:30.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus doesn’t focus
on the reason for the steward’s dismissal.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather,
he gives attention

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the steward’s reaction.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 2 through 7

00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:42.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
show us the reasoning of the steward
(knowing that he’s going to be fired).

00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:44.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:
‘I’m not strong enough to dig.

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m ashamed to beg.

00:02:46.077 --> 00:02:48.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how am I going to make a living?’

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:53.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he decides to befriend ones
who owe things to his master.

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:56.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
One debtor owes 100 measures of olive oil,

00:02:56.297 --> 00:03:00.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the steward reduces that debt
to 50 measures.

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:05.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a reduction
of nearly 300 (1,100 L) gallons of olive oil.

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:10.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another debtor owes his master
100 large measures of wheat.

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:12.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reduces that to 80.

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:15.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a reduction
of 4,000 (3,700 L) quarts of wheat.

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:19.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a substantial reduction in the debt.

00:03:19.572 --> 00:03:22.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then if we look at verse 8,

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:25.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
the master,
on finding out what the steward has done,

00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:27.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
calls him “unrighteous,”

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:31.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet he commends him
for acting “with practical wisdom.”

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here Jesus is not condoning

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
or endorsing the steward’s methods,

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:43.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor is he encouraging
crafty business practices.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:47.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus simply draws attention
to the need to be farsighted

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to use practical wisdom.

00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:54.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s identify the elements.

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:56.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
We come to our text, verse 9,
where it tells us

00:03:56.946 --> 00:04:01.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘use our unrighteous riches
to make friends.’

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus doesn’t explain in detail

00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:08.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
why he refers to the riches as unrighteous.

00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:11.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the <i>New International Version </i>
gives us a hint

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:16.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it calls the unrighteous riches
“worldly wealth.”

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
the unrighteous riches

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:21.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
represent material resources

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the control of sinful humans.

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:30.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Riches often serve selfish ends,
and they may be gained

00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:34.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
through crafty or even illegal
business practices.

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:38.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jesus states a reality.

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:40.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says “when such fail.”

00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:45.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the value of material wealth is limited,
and it’s temporary.

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:48.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be eaten away by inflation.

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the value

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
of one U.S. dollar 50 years ago.

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:57.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you had 100 dollars (U.S.) in 1969,

00:04:57.888 --> 00:05:01.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
you would need 692 dollars today

00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:04.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have the same purchasing power.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1969,
a gallon (4 L) of gas cost 32 cents.

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:10.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
A loaf of bread cost 23 cents.

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:12.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, riches fail.

00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:16.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they will definitely fail in the future.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zephaniah 1:18 says:

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:22.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Neither their silver nor their gold
will be able to save them

00:05:22.457 --> 00:05:24.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the day of Jehovah’s fury.”

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the great tribulation,

00:05:27.837 --> 00:05:32.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not going to be judged
based on the size of our bank account.

00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:34.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we’re going to be judged

00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:38.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on our storehouse of spiritual riches

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:40.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have accumulated.

00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:45.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that leads to the meaning
of the latter part of verse 9;

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that “they may receive you

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the everlasting dwelling places.”

00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:53.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
What or who

00:05:53.198 --> 00:05:57.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
is referred to by the word “they”?

00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it the riches?

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly not.

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:03.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re temporary; they’re going to fail.

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:07.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to go back to earlier in the verse
to find the antecedent.

00:06:07.172 --> 00:06:09.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is the word “friends.”

00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
So who are these friends?

00:06:12.428 --> 00:06:16.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles to John 3:16.

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:21.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are
only two possibilities of individuals

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:24.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can give us
everlasting dwelling places,

00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:27.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re identified here in this verse.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 3:16—it says:

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:32.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God loved the world so much

00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:35.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that he gave his only-begotten Son,

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:38.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that everyone exercising faith in him

00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:40.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“might not be destroyed

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:44.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have everlasting life.”

00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:47.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, only God, Jehovah,

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:50.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son, Jesus Christ,

00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:53.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
can usher us
into everlasting dwelling places,

00:06:53.723 --> 00:06:56.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether that be the heavenly Kingdom

00:06:56.267 --> 00:06:59.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the Paradise earth.

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:04.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s make application
of this illustration.

00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:08.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we use
the material things of this world

00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:12.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything we own actually belongs to them.

00:07:15.997 --> 00:07:20.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, each one of us
has a measure of money and material assets

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:24.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are free to use as we please.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus,

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:29.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to use those things in a way

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:32.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
that brings their approval.

00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:35.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our contributions
don’t have to be in the form of cash.

00:07:35.894 --> 00:07:39.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ illustration,
the debt was olive oil and wheat.

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:43.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
The unrighteous riches
might even be coconuts.

00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:46.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother in southern India
owns a coconut farm.

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:49.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
He contributed a large number of coconuts

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the local remote translation office.

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:57.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reasoned, “The office is going
to have to spend money and buy coconuts.”

00:07:57.293 --> 00:08:00.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
So his supplying the coconuts directly

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
would help his contribution go further

00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:06.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
than it would if he sold the coconuts
and gave the office the cash.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is practical wisdom.

00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:12.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we go back to Luke chapter 16,

00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:15.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s look at verse 10.

00:08:15.312 --> 00:08:18.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here it’s interesting that the principle

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:22.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘the person faithful in what is least
will be faithful in much’

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
was given in the context
of our use of material riches.

00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:30.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we cannot take
this responsibility lightly.

00:08:30.788 --> 00:08:33.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says in verse 11.

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:37.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Therefore,
if you have not proved yourselves faithful

00:08:37.336 --> 00:08:40.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in connection with the unrighteous riches,

00:08:40.632 --> 00:08:43.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will entrust you with what is true?”

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:50.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the way we use
our monetary riches or goods

00:08:50.267 --> 00:08:54.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
will affect the extent
to which the things that are true,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Kingdom interests,

00:08:56.524 --> 00:08:59.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
are entrusted to us.

00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:01.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore,
let’s remember the key point

00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:06.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ illustration
of the unrighteous steward.

00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:10.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how much or how little
of this world’s goods

00:09:10.247 --> 00:09:12.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have under our control,

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:15.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to use them
to strengthen our relationship

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:20.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our best Friends,
Jehovah and Jesus.
