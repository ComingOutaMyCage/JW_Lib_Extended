00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:01.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk

00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:04.821 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the disfellowshipping arrangement.

00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:06.389 line:10% position:50% align:center
To begin, it would be good to read

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Scriptural basis for disfellowshipping.

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:11.594 line:10% position:50% align:center
It is found in 1 Corinthians chapter 5,

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:12.762 line:10% position:50% align:center
so if you would like to open

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.264 line:10% position:50% align:center
your Bibles there,

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.800 line:10% position:50% align:center
we will start reading with verse 9

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 1 Corinthians 5.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says (and this is the apostle Paul
writing under inspiration):

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In my letter I wrote you
to stop keeping company

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with sexually immoral people,

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not meaning entirely

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the sexually
immoral people of this world

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:38.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or the greedy people
or extortioners or idolaters.

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:41.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you would actually
have to get out of the world.”

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Christians do not hold themselves
aloof from non-Witnesses.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have normal contacts with neighbors,

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
workmates, schoolmates,
and others, and we witness to them.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if some
of them are living immoral lives,

00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cannot avoid them completely.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is different, though,
with a brother who lives like that.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11 continues:

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:05.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But now I am writing you
to stop keeping company

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:08.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with anyone called a brother
who is sexually immoral

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or a greedy person or an idolater

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or a reviler
or a drunkard or an extortioner,

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:17.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even eating with such a man.”

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:19.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so at the end of verse 13,

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
he adds: “Remove the wicked person

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
from among yourselves.”

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that this inspired instruction

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:32.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
is worded as a command, not a suggestion.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
This matter
was nicely explained in the article

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why Disfellowshipping Is a Loving Provision”

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:42.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the April 15, 2015,
issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>. 

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said: “Although Jehovah
does not demand perfection from us,

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:49.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he does have a standard of holiness
that he expects his servants to meet.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For example, Jehovah insists
that we avoid such serious sins

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as sexual immorality, idolatry, thievery,

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“extortion, murder, and spiritism.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Would you not agree
that Jehovah’s clean standards

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are reasonable
and that they serve to protect us?

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:10.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who does not prefer to live among peaceful,
decent people who can be trusted?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We find such an environment
among our spiritual brothers and sisters,

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“thanks to the promise we make
at the time of our dedication to God

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live in harmony
with the guidelines found in his Word.”

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what if a baptized Christian

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:28.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
commits a serious sin?

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:30.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the congregation

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:33.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
disfellowship people
because they commit sexual immorality,

00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:36.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
idolatry, thievery, extortion,

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
murder, spiritism, or something else?

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:42.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s more to it than that.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same article explains

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:47.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
that two factors must coincide

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:51.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
that result in the disfellowshipping
of one of Jehovah’s Witnesses:

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“First, a baptized Witness
commits a serious sin.

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:59.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, he does not repent of his sin.”

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
So individuals are disfellowshipped

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:06.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
only when they are unrepentant
of the sins they have committed,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they cannot be reinstated
into the congregation

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:11.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the elders are convinced

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:15.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are genuinely repentant.

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:17.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this presents a challenge to each of us

00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:21.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it is a beloved friend or relative
who is disfellowshipped.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we be submissive and yield

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the judgment of the elders
who handle the matter?

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:29.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should accept the fact
that they are in a position

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:32.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be more objective than we are.

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders pray hard about these decisions,

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that “they will render
an account” to God,

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why they make every effort 
to recover the erring one if possible.

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:43.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if that fails,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
they must protect the congregation
and keep it morally clean.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even then,
they kindly and clearly explain

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
the steps needed to be reinstated.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they may periodically
visit the disfellowshipped person

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remind him or her
of the way back to Jehovah.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we yield to and support
the elders’ judgment,

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:09.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will actually be helping
a wrongdoer to benefit

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:11.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the discipline as coming from Jehovah.

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s so important for them to realize.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Hebrews chapter 12.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:19.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 12 starting with verse 5

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says: “And you have entirely forgotten

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the exhortation that addresses you as sons:

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My son, do not belittle
the discipline from Jehovah,

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:34.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘nor give up when you are corrected by him;

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for those whom
Jehovah loves he disciplines,

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:41.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
in fact, he scourges everyone
whom he receives as a son.’”

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then verse 11:

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:48.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“True, no discipline seems for the present
to be joyous, but it is painful;

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet afterward, it yields
the peaceable fruit of righteousness

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who have been trained by it.”

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for disfellowshipped ones
who have been trained by the discipline,

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
it has helped them
to become spiritually restored.

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:08.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the very best thing we can do
for those who are disfellowshipped?

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
We already read it at 1 Corinthians 5:11:

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop keeping company with [them] . . . ,

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:18.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even eating with [them].”

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
And speaking of the same sort of person,

00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle John wrote at 2 John 10:

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:27.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not receive him into your homes
or say a greeting to him.”

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:30.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, our loyalty is on the line,

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:34.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to the disfellowshipped person,
but to God,

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is watching to see whether
we will abide by his command

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to have contact with those
who are disfellowshipped.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:46.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of Jehovah’s people
may think this is too drastic

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that their keeping in contact

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the disfellowshipped friend or relative
is a kindness.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they could not be more wrong about that.

00:05:57.473 --> 00:06:00.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, it may salve their own feelings,

00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:03.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they would be
doing the worst possible thing

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the disfellowshipped person.

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:09.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus did point out at Matthew 11:19:

00:06:09.318 --> 00:06:12.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wisdom is proved righteous by its results.”

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can share with you many fine examples

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the good that has resulted
when a family firmly and loyally

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:22.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
upholds Jehovah’s decree not to associate

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:25.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
with disfellowshipped ones.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father said
that when his son began behaving

00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:30.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that was unacceptable,

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:34.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
his lifestyle
had put up a barrier between them.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, note that the father
recognized that it was his son

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:40.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had created the barrier, not Jehovah.

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:44.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some ten years,
the young man cleaned up his life

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
and returned to the congregation,
and he admitted:

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Being disfellowshipped
brought me face-to-face

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:53.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the consequences of my lifestyle.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:55.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed that sort of discipline.”

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
His father added: “Disfellowshipping
is an arrangement that we need,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one that helps us live
according to Jehovah’s standards.

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the long run, despite the pain,
it brings good results.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:13.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Had I been tolerant of my son’s bad conduct,
he would never have recovered.”

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
In another case, a sister admitted:
“Cutting ourselves off completely

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from all association
with [my disfellowshipped sister] . . .

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:22.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tested our loyalty to [God’s] arrangement.

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:24.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It gave [us] opportunity to show

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:28.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we really believe
that Jehovah’s way is best.”

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
And her reinstated sister later told her:

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you had viewed
the disfellowshipping lightly,

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I know that I would not have taken steps

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:39.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“toward reinstatement as soon as I did.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:44.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Being totally cut off from loved ones
and from close contact with the congregation

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:46.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“created a strong desire to repent.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I realized just how wrong my course was

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:53.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how serious it was
to turn my back on Jehovah.”

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should think of these comments

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
if ever we are tempted
to violate God’s command

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:03.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to associate with disfellowshipped
friends or relatives.

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:06.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article I have quoted from also says:

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:09.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Disfellowshipped ones who are no longer
members of the . . . congregation . . .

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:12.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may come to realize what they have lost.

00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:14.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The bitter fruits of their sinful course,

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:16.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“together with the memories of happier days

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when they enjoyed a good relationship
with Jehovah and his people,

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
could bring them to their senses.”

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:26.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah knew what he was doing

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:30.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he inspired the anointed apostles
to write what they did

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
about not having any contact

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:35.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
with disfellowshipped wrongdoers.

00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s always believe that.
