00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses love the Bible.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.112 line:10% position:50% align:center
Long before taking on the monumental task

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:09.738 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Bible translation,

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:11.490 line:10% position:50% align:center
they acquired licenses

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to print already existing translations
of the Bible.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in the 1950’s,

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society 

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
printed the first Bible
ever to be translated by Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures.</i>

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least we thought it was the first Bible

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever to be translated by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.930 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, in the fall of 2017,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.141 line:10% position:50% align:center
the World Headquarters Museum Department

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:38.350 line:10% position:50% align:center
received a Bible donated

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.560 line:10% position:50% align:center
by a brother in Germany.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Accompanying the Bible was a letter referring

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.318 line:10% position:50% align:center
to a rare Bible printed in 1934

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:49.278 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Magdeburg, the location

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:51.488 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society’s

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:54.116 line:10% position:50% align:center
Germany Branch and printery at that time.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little was known about this Bible,

00:00:56.243 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to those who did know of it,
it was thought of as something

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
unapproved by the then-president
of the Society, J.F. Rutherford.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1934, Adolph Hitler’s campaign
against Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.549 line:10% position:50% align:center
was well underway.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.636 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our religious activities were banned,

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:16.555 line:10% position:50% align:center
65 tons of literature had been seized

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and burned by Nazi authorities,
and the branch office and printery

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:24.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Magdeburg had already been confiscated
and released several times.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this may explain why
the Magdeburger Bible

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t have
a typical publishers’ page listing

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:38.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
of who published it, who translated it,
when and where it was printed.

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on the bottom of one of the last pages,

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is just one line in small letters,
and it reads: 

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Printed: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society,
Magdeburg.”

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:55.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, on September 13, 1934,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Ministry of the Interior
of the German government

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
granted permission for the Magdeburg office

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume
the printing and distribution of Bibles.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, everybody knew that the facilities
could be shut down again,

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:13.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps permanently, at any time.

00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
What really could be accomplished
in the limited time they had?

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Magdeburg office informed Rutherford

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had possession 

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:25.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a New Testament manuscript
ready for printing and, additionally,

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
a translation of the Old Testament
was nearly complete.

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
In October 1934,

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rutherford approved
the printing of 100,000 copies.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
But time was running out.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford received
the following letter dated August 6, 1935,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it says: “In the afternoon of July 10th

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:51.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a number of officials
of the secret Police of Berlin and Magdeburg

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:53.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appeared and sealed the factory,

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“rooms and offices at Magdeburg,
closed all factory rooms,

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:58.449 line:10% position:50% align:center
“attached the property

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.742 line:10% position:50% align:center
“and money of the Society . . .

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:01.493 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Several thousand Bibles

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:02.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
“were just been bound

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:03.954 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the rest is printed.”

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:06.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, only a small number

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:10.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those Bibles
actually made it out of the printery.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:12.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
In November 2017,

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
after a careful search,

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:18.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were able to obtain three copies
of the Magdeburger Bible.

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:22.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little did we know what a treasured place

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our organization’s history
of Bible translation

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:28.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and printing this Bible deserves!

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a mere compilation
of existing translations

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a fresh, unique translation of the Bible.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s name is used extensively

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the text of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as in footnotes
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Magdeburger Bible was also

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:51.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
cited in German-language editions
of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
And nearly a century later,

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
the text can still be easily understood

00:03:57.132 --> 00:03:59.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the German reader.

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible translation
truly has a remarkable story.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s print run was small
by normal Bible-printing standards,

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:09.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its distribution was even smaller.

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:12.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although it was produced in record time

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:16.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and under highly dangerous circumstances,
its story

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
lay forgotten for decades
until it was rediscovered.

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Magdeburger Bible
is the first-known Bible

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be translated and published
by Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:30.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
predating the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures.</i>

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was able to survive in a time
of Nazi government opposition

00:04:34.962 --> 00:04:37.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is now part of our
Bible Museum at Warwick.

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:41.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible truly is a testimony

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the words we find at Isaiah 40:8: 

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:50.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>“Aber Jehovas Wort bleibt ewiglich!”</i>
