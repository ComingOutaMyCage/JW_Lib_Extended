00:00:01 Jehovah’s Witnesses love the Bible.
00:00:05 Long before taking on the monumental task
00:00:08 of Bible translation,
00:00:09 they acquired licenses
00:00:11 to print already existing translations of the Bible.
00:00:14 And then in the 1950’s,
00:00:17 the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society
00:00:19 printed the first Bible ever to be translated by Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:23 —the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
00:00:26 At least we thought it was the first Bible
00:00:29 ever to be translated by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:32 Well, in the fall of 2017,
00:00:34 the World Headquarters Museum Department
00:00:37 received a Bible donated
00:00:38 by a brother in Germany.
00:00:40 Accompanying the Bible was a letter referring
00:00:43 to a rare Bible printed in 1934
00:00:47 at Magdeburg, the location
00:00:49 of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society’s
00:00:51 Germany Branch and printery at that time.
00:00:54 Little was known about this Bible,
00:00:56 and to those who did know of it, it was thought of as something
00:01:00 unapproved by the then-president of the Society, J.F. Rutherford.
00:01:04 By 1934, Adolph Hitler’s campaign against Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:08 was well underway.
00:01:10 Our religious activities were banned,
00:01:13 65 tons of literature had been seized
00:01:16 and burned by Nazi authorities, and the branch office and printery
00:01:20 at Magdeburg had already been confiscated and released several times.
00:01:27 And this may explain why the Magdeburger Bible
00:01:29 doesn’t have a typical publishers’ page listing
00:01:33 of who published it, who translated it, when and where it was printed.
00:01:38 But on the bottom of one of the last pages,
00:01:41 there is just one line in small letters, and it reads:
00:01:46 “Printed: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Magdeburg.”
00:01:51 Interestingly, on September 13, 1934,
00:01:55 the Ministry of the Interior of the German government
00:01:57 granted permission for the Magdeburg office
00:02:00 to resume the printing and distribution of Bibles.
00:02:06 However, everybody knew that the facilities could be shut down again,
00:02:10 perhaps permanently, at any time.
00:02:13 What really could be accomplished in the limited time they had?
00:02:17 The Magdeburg office informed Rutherford
00:02:19 that they had possession
00:02:21 of a New Testament manuscript ready for printing and, additionally,
00:02:25 a translation of the Old Testament was nearly complete.
00:02:28 In October 1934,
00:02:31 Rutherford approved the printing of 100,000 copies.
00:02:35 But time was running out.
00:02:38 Brother Rutherford received the following letter dated August 6, 1935,
00:02:43 and it says: “In the afternoon of July 10th
00:02:47 “a number of officials of the secret Police of Berlin and Magdeburg
00:02:51 “appeared and sealed the factory,
00:02:53 “rooms and offices at Magdeburg, closed all factory rooms,
00:02:57 “attached the property
00:02:58 “and money of the Society . . .
00:02:59 “Several thousand Bibles
00:03:01 “were just been bound
00:03:02 and the rest is printed.”
00:03:04 Sadly, only a small number
00:03:06 of those Bibles actually made it out of the printery.
00:03:10 In November 2017,
00:03:12 after a careful search,
00:03:14 we were able to obtain three copies of the Magdeburger Bible.
00:03:18 Little did we know what a treasured place
00:03:22 in our organization’s history of Bible translation
00:03:25 and printing this Bible deserves!
00:03:29 It’s not a mere compilation of existing translations
00:03:32 but a fresh, unique translation of the Bible.
00:03:36 Jehovah’s name is used extensively
00:03:39 in the text of the Hebrew Scriptures
00:03:41 as well as in footnotes of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:03:45 The Magdeburger Bible was also
00:03:48 cited in German-language editions of The Watchtower.
00:03:51 And nearly a century later,
00:03:53 the text can still be easily understood
00:03:57 by the German reader.
00:03:59 This Bible translation truly has a remarkable story.
00:04:02 It’s print run was small by normal Bible-printing standards,
00:04:07 and its distribution was even smaller.
00:04:09 And although it was produced in record time
00:04:12 and under highly dangerous circumstances, its story
00:04:16 lay forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered.
00:04:19 The Magdeburger Bible is the first-known Bible
00:04:22 to be translated and published by Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:04:26 predating the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
00:04:30 It was able to survive in a time of Nazi government opposition
00:04:34 and is now part of our Bible Museum at Warwick.
00:04:38 This Bible truly is a testimony
00:04:41 to the words we find at Isaiah 40:8:
00:04:46 “Aber Jehovas Wort bleibt ewiglich!”
