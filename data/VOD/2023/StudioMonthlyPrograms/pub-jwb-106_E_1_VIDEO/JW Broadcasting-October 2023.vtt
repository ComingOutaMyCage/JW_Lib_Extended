Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll examine what “the good news” is

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:13.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why it’s such a blessing.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll consider how examples from

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Bible
and our modern history encourage us

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:22.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
to declare all of the good news boldly.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn from a faithful brother in Rwanda

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we can maintain
our zeal for the good news

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite persecution and imprisonment.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll enjoy a new music video
that reminds us

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much joy we can have
sharing the good news with others.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:44.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:47.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
for October 2023.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:11.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we have a wonderful privilege

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:14.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the privilege of “declaring the good news”!

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:18.350 line:10% position:50% align:center
But just what does that good news include?

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.977 line:10% position:50% align:center
If we know the answer,

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:21.603 line:10% position:50% align:center
how will that motivate us

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:25.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be even more zealous
as we declare the good news?

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:29.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the answers
to those questions.

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:33.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
what is the good news?

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:35.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get an idea
by looking at how this expression

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:38.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
is used in the Bible.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:42.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we read of “the good news of the Kingdom,”

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news of God,”

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:47.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news about Jesus Christ,”

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:51.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news
of the undeserved kindness of God,”

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:53.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news of peace,”

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the “everlasting good news.”

00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:59.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can say that the good news refers

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the rule of God’s Kingdom

00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:06.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and salvation by faith in Jesus.

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:10.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes all the truths
about which Jesus spoke

00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:12.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the disciples wrote.

00:02:12.864 --> 00:02:14.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the prophet Isaiah,

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:18.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah spoke
about the preaching of the good news.

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:21.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah’s prophecy described the purpose

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:24.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and effect of the good news to be preached,

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:28.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly from the time
of Messiah’s coming.

00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:33.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what’s recorded at Isaiah 61:1, 2:

00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:38.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
is upon me,

00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:42.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because Jehovah anointed me
to declare good news to the meek.

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:46.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:49.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim liberty to the captives

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:52.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the wide opening of the eyes
to the prisoners,

00:02:52.863 --> 00:02:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s goodwill

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:59.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the day of vengeance of our God,

00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:02.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
to comfort all who mourn.”

00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:05.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
This good news would have a positive effect

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:07.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
on those who listened to it.

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:10.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would “bind up the brokenhearted”

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:12.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “comfort all who mourn.”

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is likely the kind of good news

00:03:14.843 --> 00:03:17.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we talk about most in our ministry.

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:22.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prospect of enjoying everlasting life
in an earthly paradise

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:25.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the rule of God’s Kingdom

00:03:25.062 --> 00:03:27.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides hope to our listeners

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:30.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and motivates them to love Jehovah.

00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:35.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the good news
also includes something else,

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:39.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that we may not talk about
as readily in our ministry.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:43.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may have noticed in Isaiah
the expression

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the day of vengeance of our God.”

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s more to the good news

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:51.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just “the year of Jehovah’s goodwill.”

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:54.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see this clearly in the words recorded

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Revelation 14:6, 7:

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:03.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:05.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had everlasting good news

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:08.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to declare to those who dwell on the earth,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and tongue and people.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was saying in a loud voice:

00:04:15.613 --> 00:04:18.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Fear God and give him glory,

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:22.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because the hour of judgment by him
has arrived,

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:25.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so worship the One who made the heaven

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the earth and the sea

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:29.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the springs of water.’”

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, the “everlasting good news”

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
also includes a judgment message.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:39.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the hour of judgment”
mentioned in this verse?

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to some reference works,

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
the original language term
here rendered “judgment”

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
refers to a “legal process of judgment,”

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “scrutiny of conduct.”

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:56.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
So God is looking closely at conduct
—how people act.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:00.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the basis for judgment.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The hour of judgment”
mentioned in this verse

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:05.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
includes both the pronouncement

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the execution of divine judgment

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
against all false religion
—Babylon the Great—

00:05:12.254 --> 00:05:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all other parts
of Satan’s system of things.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:20.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Babylon the Great
and this world’s institutions

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:23.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
have already been judged.

00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:26.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
their sentence has yet to be carried out.

00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:28.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will that happen?

00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:32.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Toward the end of “the hour of judgment,”

00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will conclude
at the climax of the last days

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:39.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the destruction
of the present wicked system.

00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:45.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the actions of people today
matter so much.

00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:48.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s increasingly urgent that we proclaim

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:51.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judgment aspect of the good news to them

00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:55.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the time
when God will execute judgment

00:05:55.173 --> 00:05:57.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
is fast approaching.

00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, though,
can we say that this judgment message

00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
is good news?

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good news for honesthearted ones

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:09.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it means the end of wickedness,

00:06:09.687 --> 00:06:14.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
including all forms
of injustice and violence.

00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who are suffering
as a result of the bad actions of the wicked,

00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:22.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
this judgment will bring great relief!

00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:27.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be a clear demonstration
of Jehovah’s love and justice.

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:32.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, it will be bad news
for those who stubbornly refuse

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bible times,

00:06:38.592 --> 00:06:41.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah warned of various acts of judgment

00:06:41.303 --> 00:06:43.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would bring against those

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
who deliberately disobeyed his commands.

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each case,
he informed the affected people

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
well in advance

00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:54.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instructed them to make changes

00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:57.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were in harmony with his will.

00:06:57.695 --> 00:07:00.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
To encourage the right response,

00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:03.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
he often used his loyal servants on earth

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
to announce his judgments

00:07:05.202 --> 00:07:08.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to convey a sense of urgency.

00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:11.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, think of Noah.

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
For years,
he fearlessly warned

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:16.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
the immoral and violent people of his day

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:19.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a coming global Flood.

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:23.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also told them 
they needed to do to survive.

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Moses and Aaron?

00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:31.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used them
to warn Pharaoh and his servants.

00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:35.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
think about the specific warning Jehovah gave

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:39.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the seventh plague,
a devastating hailstorm.

00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:42.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Exodus 9:18, 19,

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:44.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read that Moses and Aaron

00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:48.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave the people
the time and the information they needed

00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect themselves from the storm.

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:54.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah always makes sure

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:59.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people have sufficient opportunity
to heed his warnings.

00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:01.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 3:9 says:

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He does not desire anyone to be destroyed

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:08.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
but desires all to attain to repentance.”

00:08:08.725 --> 00:08:11.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news we are now preaching
informs people

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:16.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only of the marvelous hope for the future
that Jehovah offers

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also of what we must do
to enjoy that hope.

00:08:20.737 --> 00:08:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need to let people know

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:26.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s soon-to-come judgment.

00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:30.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the preaching of the good news
is tied to divine judgment

00:08:30.497 --> 00:08:33.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 24:14:

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom

00:08:36.336 --> 00:08:39.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:42.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

00:08:42.176 --> 00:08:44.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the end will come.”

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:48.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note how the good news serves as “a witness”

00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:50.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
to everyone who hears it.

00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:52.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depending on what they do with it,

00:08:52.394 --> 00:08:55.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will result in their eventual acquittal

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:57.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
or condemnation.

00:08:57.858 --> 00:09:01.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as a court takes time
to hear all the facts

00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:03.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to weigh all the evidence,

00:09:03.364 --> 00:09:06.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is wisely using his time now

00:09:06.617 --> 00:09:08.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
to judge people fairly.

00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:13.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both he and Jehovah continue
to analyze the conduct of individuals

00:09:13.583 --> 00:09:17.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they respond
to the good news that we’re preaching.

00:09:18.713 --> 00:09:23.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should what we’ve just considered
about the good news affect us?

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
we will not hold back

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:29.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
from sharing all of the good news.

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:33.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will talk about the future blessings
God has promised

00:09:33.353 --> 00:09:36.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as God’s judgment of the wicked,

00:09:36.022 --> 00:09:38.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will make these blessings possible.

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:43.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine for a moment
that you knew that a dangerous storm

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
was bearing down on where you lived.

00:09:45.698 --> 00:09:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you do?

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:50.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you try to be
as prepared as possible

00:09:50.245 --> 00:09:53.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you
could successfully weather the storm?

00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:56.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you warn your family,
friends, even neighbors

00:09:56.793 --> 00:09:59.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to help them to do the same?

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:01.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a similar way,

00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:04.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
we try to help as many people as possible

00:10:04.468 --> 00:10:07.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare for the impending execution

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s judgments on this world.

00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:12.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
While being tactful,

00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:14.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not hold back from letting people know

00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:17.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they need to do to be saved.

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:20.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we help our Bible students

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand what they need to do.

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a frank yet kind way,

00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:29.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
we help them to see
what changes they need to make

00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:33.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
to harmonize their lives
with Jehovah’s standards.

00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:37.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our new study tool, <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:41.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to help us do such teaching.

00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:45.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes several features
to help our Bible students qualify

00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:48.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the good news as soon as possible.

00:10:49.221 --> 00:10:52.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
at the end of each section,

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:57.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a review with questions,
some of which are quite pointed.

00:10:57.605 --> 00:11:00.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Considering these questions with our students

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:03.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help them to see
what they need to do

00:11:03.319 --> 00:11:07.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply what they’ve been learning
in their Bible study.

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:11.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll have an opportunity
to watch a video later on in this program

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:16.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will demonstrate
some of the features in <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:11:16.749 --> 00:11:20.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can use them
to help our Bible students.

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:24.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding the importance
of the good news

00:11:24.424 --> 00:11:29.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
will also motivate us
to preach and teach it with urgency!

00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:31.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll strive to have a full share

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:35.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all aspects of the ministry
available to us.

00:11:35.602 --> 00:11:38.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than taking a casual approach,

00:11:38.313 --> 00:11:43.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be zealous
and “work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah.”

00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:44.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:48.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we realize
that people’s lives are at stake;

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
they urgently need to hear the good news

00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:53.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and respond to it.

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:58.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we all have
different circumstances and abilities.

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:02.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah and Jesus
take this into account.

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:05.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ illustration of the talents,

00:12:05.382 --> 00:12:09.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
not all the slaves
were given the same number of talents.

00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:14.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, the talents were distributed
‘according to their ability.’

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds us that Jehovah and Jesus

00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:21.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
are aware of our personal situations.

00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:23.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know what we can reasonably do,

00:12:23.817 --> 00:12:27.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they never expect anything beyond that.

00:12:27.321 --> 00:12:31.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nor do they compare us
to our fellow brothers and sisters.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing this is very comforting

00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:36.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we may not always be able to do

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:39.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
all that we want to do in the preaching work.

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:43.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s often the case
with our dear older ones

00:12:43.337 --> 00:12:47.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others who cope with serious limitations.

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:50.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we can all feel confident

00:12:50.094 --> 00:12:53.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
that as long as we do our personal best,

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be pleased with us.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:59.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll never ‘forget our work
and the love that we show.’

00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:04.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may each of us
continue to do all that we can

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:08.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the good news
—all of the good news!

00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:13.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so,
we will experience great joy and contentment

00:13:13.618 --> 00:13:16.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we participate
in this lifesaving work,

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:20.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping as many as possible
before it’s too late.

00:13:22.377 --> 00:13:25.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you sometimes worry, though,
how people might react,

00:13:25.797 --> 00:13:29.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially to a stronger judgment message?

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:32.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Facing this fear is not new.

00:13:32.053 --> 00:13:36.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people in ancient and modern times
have dealt with it too.

00:13:36.808 --> 00:13:39.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following demonstration,

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:41.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s see what one brother is moved to do

00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:44.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
after meditating on their examples.

00:14:13.304 --> 00:14:15.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:14:15.347 --> 00:14:17.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry I was running
a little behind this morning,

00:14:17.349 --> 00:14:19.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at least I come bearing gifts.

00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:20.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.
No worries.

00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:23.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.
I could really use it today.

00:14:25.941 --> 00:14:27.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you also thinking

00:14:27.943 --> 00:14:31.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
about that announcement
about the special preaching campaign?

00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:41.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah-yeah, I was.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t take what I’m going to say
the wrong way,

00:14:45.795 --> 00:14:47.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:14:47.338 --> 00:14:49.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t you think
the message we’ll be preaching

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
is pretty harsh?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I wouldn’t say that,

00:14:56.973 --> 00:15:00.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s definitely very direct.

00:15:00.393 --> 00:15:02.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, people already get defensive

00:15:02.562 --> 00:15:04.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
whenever you challenge their beliefs,

00:15:04.856 --> 00:15:07.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is going to be the next level.

00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:12.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t going to be
the easiest message to deliver.

00:15:12.822 --> 00:15:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know,
it’s not the first time we’ve done this.

00:15:15.742 --> 00:15:16.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:15:16.576 --> 00:15:17.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:19.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if you remember me telling you

00:15:19.621 --> 00:15:22.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my family is originally from Quebec,

00:15:22.415 --> 00:15:25.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my dad was part
of an incredibly hard-hitting witness

00:15:25.877 --> 00:15:27.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in the 1940’s.

00:15:27.504 --> 00:15:29.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I looked this up last night.

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:33.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to distribute a tract that called out

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
the local religious leaders as hypocrites.

00:15:37.598 --> 00:15:38.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were they doing?

00:15:38.891 --> 00:15:41.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were inciting their followers

00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:44.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
to mob violence against the Witnesses,

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:46.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling them to vandalize our properties,

00:15:46.607 --> 00:15:49.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
even getting brothers falsely arrested

00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:50.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imprisoned.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow, and they had to distribute that tract
during the violence?

00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to.

00:15:56.659 --> 00:16:01.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wanted to show
how unjust their actions were.

00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I remember my dad telling me—

00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:10.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that initially
he was pretty terrified.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean, that’s how I feel.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m-I’m terrified.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s normal to feel that way.

00:16:20.808 --> 00:16:23.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been thinking about it myself,

00:16:23.477 --> 00:16:26.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I thought of an account in Exodus.

00:16:26.063 --> 00:16:29.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s where Moses tells the Israelites

00:16:29.442 --> 00:16:32.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
to splatter the blood of a ram
on their doorposts

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:35.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to avoid
the effects of the last plague.

00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:38.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought
about how some of the Israelites

00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:41.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
might have felt about doing that back then.

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:43.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s all Moses told us.

00:16:44.624 --> 00:16:47.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And everyone has to do this?
Every family?

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:53.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rams are sacred to the Egyptians!

00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:55.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, this would be an affront to Amon-Ra.

00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:57.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are the Egyptians going to react?

00:17:01.433 --> 00:17:03.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.
I’ve thought about that too.

00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:07.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Moses know what he’s asking us to do?

00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:19.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, I don’t know
if we have anything to worry about.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have anything to fear.

00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of how Jehovah has protected us
with these last plagues.

00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:34.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as for the blood,

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:38.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not a matter of offending them;

00:17:38.095 --> 00:17:41.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a matter of protecting us.

00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:43.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s showing whose side we’re on

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s side.

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:54.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back,
what the Israelites did

00:17:54.445 --> 00:17:58.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
was actually good news.

00:17:58.157 --> 00:18:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant their deliverance,

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:04.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s the same
with any message we bear today.

00:18:04.497 --> 00:18:07.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you one of my favorite scriptures

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:11.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 41:10.

00:18:12.672 --> 00:18:16.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:19.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:18:19.387 --> 00:18:22.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:18:22.682 --> 00:18:24.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:18:24.684 --> 00:18:26.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:18:30.273 --> 00:18:33.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fear we feel is natural.

00:18:33.401 --> 00:18:36.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember,

00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:40.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was with the Israelites,

00:18:40.241 --> 00:18:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was with my dad,

00:18:43.453 --> 00:18:45.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will be with us.

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:49.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
The message we are sharing is good news.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:59.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
The faithful record of God’s servants,
ancient and modern,

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:02.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthens us to carry out
our preaching work

00:19:02.556 --> 00:19:05.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
and declare the good news.

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:08.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on Jehovah’s unfailing support

00:19:08.562 --> 00:19:12.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us overcome any fear we may have.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Bible students face many challenges

00:19:15.444 --> 00:19:17.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they learn about the good news.

00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:21.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may need to make drastic changes
to harmonize their lives

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:24.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s standards.

00:19:24.078 --> 00:19:26.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can be difficult.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we help them make these changes

00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:34.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can begin sharing
the good news alongside us? 

00:19:34.004 --> 00:19:36.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:19:36.048 --> 00:19:39.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been designed to help us do just that.

00:19:39.552 --> 00:19:41.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see encouraging evidence

00:19:41.554 --> 00:19:44.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this powerful tool is really working.

00:19:50.604 --> 00:19:52.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard about the new publication,

00:19:52.732 --> 00:19:54.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book,

00:19:54.775 --> 00:19:56.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very nervous.

00:19:57.695 --> 00:19:59.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a change,
and sometimes

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
I don’t like change.

00:20:01.073 --> 00:20:03.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
But I knew that it was for the best.

00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:05.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just needed to try it out.

00:20:07.413 --> 00:20:10.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
I hadn’t had a progressive Bible study in years.

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:11.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the book—

00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:15.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way it was designed 
was to help me as a teacher.

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:18.508 line:10% position:50% align:center
Once the features of this new publication

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:19.551 line:10% position:50% align:center
were explained,

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was going to help us
to help our Bible students

00:20:22.136 --> 00:20:24.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
begin preaching in the ministry

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:28.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as help our Bible students
make changes in their everyday lives,

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were really excited

00:20:29.602 --> 00:20:31.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
about using those features
to help our students to do so.

00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:36.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like the “Some People Say” section

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the bottom of the lesson

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that helps prepare her
for informal witnessing.

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:45.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps them to formulate in their own words

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to defend their faith

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.289 line:10% position:50% align:center
or how to preach informally

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:50.874 line:10% position:50% align:center
or use those opportunities

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.209 line:10% position:50% align:center
to share what they’ve just learned.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was her way of learning
how to feel comfortable

00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:58.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking to others about Jehovah

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teaching others about Jehovah.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:02.386 line:10% position:50% align:center
You’re right away,

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:03.846 line:10% position:50% align:center
from lesson 01 and lesson 02,

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:06.056 line:10% position:50% align:center
encouraging them to recognize

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not
just about what they’re learning

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s also
about what they can share with others.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the Bible teacher,

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:15.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
it helps us to round out the rough edges

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that when they do speak to others,
it’s tactful.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
I put her in that place,

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:23.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
like: “What would you say
if someone told you that Jesus was God?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you answer that question?”

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:28.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that went to her heart,
and she was able to answer the question.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I would tell them this.
I would say this.”

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that’s exactly what happened.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:37.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was telling her family
about the lessons that she was learning,

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things that she learned from the Bible,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
so all along she was informally witnessing

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:43.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not realizing that’s what she was doing.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you see that connection

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
between what they’re learning
and how they can use what they learn,

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:51.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s just a wonderful feeling

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you recognize that now
they’ll be able to teach somebody else.

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:01.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing that the book also does

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:03.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it progressively helps the student

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:07.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make changes in their personal life
in order to live by Jehovah’s standards.

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:11.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
The section review is a series of questions

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:14.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
that usually has a key question

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a key verse related to that lesson.

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:18.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
So before going on to the next section,

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:20.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s almost like a filter.

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stops them,
helps them to review,

00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:24.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helps the teacher realize,

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Hmm,
they don’t quite understand that point.’

00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:28.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are excellent

00:22:28.557 --> 00:22:30.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they can get
the expressions from your student,

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:33.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you can really focus

00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:35.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what exactly the issues are
that they’re having.

00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:41.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to see
if she had any gray areas,

00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:45.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
if there was a problem,
or if she didn’t understand something.

00:22:45.824 --> 00:22:49.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they saying,
“The book says” or “You taught me this”?

00:22:49.912 --> 00:22:51.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you know, ‘OK,

00:22:51.497 --> 00:22:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
they need to be reminded of the Scriptures,’

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you need to seed that truth

00:22:56.543 --> 00:22:58.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little bit deeper into their heart.

00:23:00.464 --> 00:23:02.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when I saw my student express herself

00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:05.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let me know things she was thinking

00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:07.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
or things that were bothering her

00:23:07.513 --> 00:23:10.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that she realized
that she needed to make changes with.

00:23:12.351 --> 00:23:16.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
The questions are a bit more personal
than maybe you would have asked in the past.

00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:21.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re a bit more pointed
than maybe we have the habit of of asking.

00:23:21.444 --> 00:23:25.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
In comparing my questions I used in the past
with what’s in the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book,

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, I wasn’t getting anywhere before.

00:23:29.827 --> 00:23:33.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
These questions really help the students
speak from their heart,

00:23:33.956 --> 00:23:35.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m so glad they’re there.

00:23:36.751 --> 00:23:38.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes time.

00:23:38.377 --> 00:23:40.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also takes patience and love on our part

00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:44.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let them make those changes
so they can qualify

00:23:44.509 --> 00:23:46.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become an unbaptized publisher.

00:23:49.347 --> 00:23:51.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
This publication,
the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book,

00:23:51.683 --> 00:23:53.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like no other.

00:23:53.268 --> 00:23:56.187 line:10% position:50% align:center
It makes it much easier for them,

00:23:56.187 --> 00:23:58.898 line:10% position:50% align:center
and you can help them much faster to get there.

00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:04.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
That book has helped a lot.
It has definitely boosted my confidence.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was designed to just bring people

00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:07.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
right into the truth.

00:24:07.949 --> 00:24:10.660 line:10% position:50% align:center
She said the book was made especially for her.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.287 line:10% position:50% align:center
When the time came for her

00:24:12.287 --> 00:24:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do the door-to-door ministry,
she was ready.

00:24:16.124 --> 00:24:18.752 line:10% position:50% align:center
My student has already started

00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:21.213 line:10% position:50% align:center
several Bible studies.

00:24:21.213 --> 00:24:23.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
This study program has trained him now

00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:26.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be a Bible teacher.

00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:31.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you follow everything that’s in the book,
it’s like a complete study.

00:24:31.014 --> 00:24:33.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s little that we can add ourselves.

00:24:33.058 --> 00:24:35.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s all there.

00:24:37.938 --> 00:24:41.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i> 
has many well-worded questions,

00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:44.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of which are quite pointed,

00:24:44.236 --> 00:24:47.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help our students reason on God’s Word

00:24:47.114 --> 00:24:49.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to think deeply about the changes

00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:52.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
they need to make to please Jehovah.

00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:55.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
The publication also shows them
how to preach informally

00:24:55.998 --> 00:24:59.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stresses
how important it is for all of us

00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share what we know with others.

00:25:02.505 --> 00:25:06.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone who serves Jehovah
has the responsibility

00:25:06.342 --> 00:25:09.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
to declare all of the good news.

00:25:09.762 --> 00:25:13.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul reminded us at 1 Thessalonians 2:2

00:25:13.808 --> 00:25:16.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would need
boldness to preach the good news

00:25:16.852 --> 00:25:19.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the face of much opposition.”

00:25:19.564 --> 00:25:21.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do that?

00:25:21.566 --> 00:25:22.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s learn from

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:26.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gaspard Rwakabubu’s experience
and see how

00:25:26.821 --> 00:25:29.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
he maintained his zeal through persecution

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imprisonment.

00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:35.580 line:10% position:50% align:center
During the 1970’s,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.998 line:10% position:50% align:center
the preaching work

00:25:36.998 --> 00:25:39.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
was not recognized in Rwanda.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my family and I

00:25:41.336 --> 00:25:43.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
received a letter of invitation

00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:44.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go serve there,

00:25:44.422 --> 00:25:46.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were living a good life.

00:25:46.508 --> 00:25:48.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had some concerns,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
but praying to Jehovah

00:25:51.554 --> 00:25:54.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asking him for direction helped us.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I discussed it with my wife,

00:25:58.061 --> 00:26:01.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were both positive about it.

00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:06.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
We made a request
for legal recognition in 1982,

00:26:07.154 --> 00:26:09.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
but instead, I

00:26:09.406 --> 00:26:11.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two other brothers

00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:12.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
were thrown into prison.

00:26:13.827 --> 00:26:15.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, on a Sunday,

00:26:15.912 --> 00:26:18.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
the archbishop came to the prison,

00:26:18.665 --> 00:26:20.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he announced,

00:26:20.042 --> 00:26:23.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beware of those Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:26:23.712 --> 00:26:25.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of that,

00:26:25.756 --> 00:26:29.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
he raised the curiosity of his listeners.

00:26:29.134 --> 00:26:32.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prisoners wanted some explanations from us 

00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:35.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they could not understand what he meant.

00:26:37.643 --> 00:26:41.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many began to join our meetings.

00:26:43.607 --> 00:26:46.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
The archbishop was not happy.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
He grew even angrier.

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:52.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in order to stop our activities,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told his close followers to beat us up

00:26:55.953 --> 00:26:58.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we attended the following meeting.

00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:02.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two young prisoners approached us,

00:27:02.877 --> 00:27:04.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they said,

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Today they plan to beat you up.”

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:10.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our meeting time came,

00:27:10.802 --> 00:27:12.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t show up.

00:27:14.055 --> 00:27:17.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another religious group came
and took our place that night,

00:27:17.225 --> 00:27:19.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they were the ones who got beaten up.

00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:23.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
From that time on,
no one disturbed us any longer.

00:27:23.022 --> 00:27:26.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continued preaching
and attending meetings peacefully.

00:27:27.694 --> 00:27:30.196 line:10% position:50% align:center
After spending two years in prison,

00:27:30.196 --> 00:27:32.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
we were freed.

00:27:34.868 --> 00:27:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Outside of prison,
the brothers were not free to preach.

00:27:40.457 --> 00:27:44.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many more brothers and sisters
kept being arrested and imprisoned.

00:27:45.587 --> 00:27:48.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, I was put in prison again,

00:27:48.715 --> 00:27:50.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the imprisoned brothers

00:27:50.926 --> 00:27:53.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoiced over my presence, saying,

00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:56.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We now have our circuit overseer visiting us.”

00:27:56.556 --> 00:27:58.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were very happy.

00:27:58.558 --> 00:28:00.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started working together

00:28:00.602 --> 00:28:02.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony and preaching.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one was assigned a territory.

00:28:06.024 --> 00:28:08.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were discouraged,

00:28:08.235 --> 00:28:10.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I tried to strengthen

00:28:10.195 --> 00:28:14.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encourage them to hold on to Jehovah.

00:28:15.826 --> 00:28:19.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then brothers from all over the world

00:28:19.913 --> 00:28:22.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to write to the head of state.

00:28:23.751 --> 00:28:26.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Letters were coming in huge quantities!

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those letters had a good impact because,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
finally, one day

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
an announcement was made on the radio

00:28:33.469 --> 00:28:35.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the president himself

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:37.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that he pardoned Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:41.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people on the street started shouting at us:

00:28:41.102 --> 00:28:43.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah has won!

00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:45.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah has won!

00:28:45.064 --> 00:28:47.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has won!”

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:28:54.323 --> 00:28:58.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
was legally recognized in 1992.

00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:03.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, in 1994,

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time of genocide,

00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:07.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of our brothers died

00:29:07.587 --> 00:29:11.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others faced serious challenges.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:16.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some fled to Goma as refugees.

00:29:17.096 --> 00:29:19.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received the assignment

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:23.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
to oversee the relief funds
that were coming from Kinshasa.

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:25.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had just collected the relief money

00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:30.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our refugee brothers,

00:29:30.443 --> 00:29:33.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was stopped by two policemen.

00:29:33.363 --> 00:29:34.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
They possibly thought

00:29:34.614 --> 00:29:36.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could get that money.

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:40.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they asked me to go with them

00:29:40.036 --> 00:29:41.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their superior.

00:29:44.207 --> 00:29:45.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we were walking,

00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remembered a prayer

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:49.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our daughter Deborah said

00:29:49.129 --> 00:29:50.881 line:10% position:50% align:center
during the genocide.

00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:53.842 line:10% position:50% align:center
While the whole family was praying silently,

00:29:53.842 --> 00:29:55.844 line:10% position:50% align:center
she prayed out loud,

00:29:55.844 --> 00:29:58.263 line:10% position:50% align:center
pouring her heart out to Jehovah.

00:29:59.014 --> 00:30:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to that,
they refrained from killing us.

00:30:03.936 --> 00:30:08.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
This moved me to pray in my heart too.

00:30:08.232 --> 00:30:11.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as I said “Amen,”

00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:12.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two policemen turned right

00:30:12.987 --> 00:30:15.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went to meet their colleague.

00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also saw in front of me a brother

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
holding a black suitcase,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking exactly like the one
I had with the money.

00:30:23.747 --> 00:30:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
I handed him mine, full of money,

00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:29.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he gave me his with literature inside.

00:30:30.254 --> 00:30:32.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then without delay, the policemen said:

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:33.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let’s go now.

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:35.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go.”

00:30:35.217 --> 00:30:37.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
We walked all the way to the chief of police,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they found nothing.

00:30:40.014 --> 00:30:42.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were holding their chins in their hands,

00:30:42.517 --> 00:30:44.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying: “This is a miracle!

00:30:44.894 --> 00:30:47.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could the money we saw
turn into books?”

00:30:48.648 --> 00:30:51.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
In all the trials I’ve encountered,

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really saw Jehovah’s powerful hand!

00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:57.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a house built on a rock

00:30:57.323 --> 00:30:59.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is struck by storms

00:30:59.325 --> 00:31:01.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
(hit by anything)

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
but remains firm,

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:06.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
we too met with many trying challenges,

00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:09.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah continued to make us firm,

00:31:09.252 --> 00:31:12.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like a house built on a rock.

00:31:14.466 --> 00:31:17.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
A scripture found at Isaiah 54:17

00:31:17.761 --> 00:31:20.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
explains that in reality

00:31:20.722 --> 00:31:23.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those fighting against us,

00:31:23.183 --> 00:31:25.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter who they are,

00:31:25.435 --> 00:31:27.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
will never succeed.

00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:29.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up until this moment,

00:31:29.689 --> 00:31:32.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
although my physical strength
is gradually fading,

00:31:32.984 --> 00:31:35.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that the power to serve Jehovah

00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:37.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
is growing so much.

00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:41.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, I feel more powerful than ever.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
My determination
is that no matter the situation,

00:31:45.873 --> 00:31:48.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will continue to serve Jehovah.

00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:53.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve met Brother Rwakabubu

00:31:53.964 --> 00:31:58.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and personally heard
many of his amazing experiences,

00:31:58.344 --> 00:32:01.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of which he acted out for me.

00:32:01.555 --> 00:32:05.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
The experience of his daughter’s prayer
can be found 

00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:07.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
on pages 198 and 199

00:32:07.937 --> 00:32:11.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>2012 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</i>

00:32:12.608 --> 00:32:15.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rwakabubu’s daughter
was six years old

00:32:15.694 --> 00:32:19.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she prayed
in front of a group of soldiers.

00:32:19.073 --> 00:32:22.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The soldiers were planning to kill
the entire family,

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Brother Rwakabubu’s five children.

00:32:27.081 --> 00:32:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, her innocent and earnest prayer

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
touched the hearts
of those hardened soldiers.

00:32:34.797 --> 00:32:39.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Brother Rwakabubu
deals with various health issues

00:32:39.177 --> 00:32:43.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resulted from his persecution
and imprisonment.

00:32:43.556 --> 00:32:47.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Brother Rwakabubu’s reliance
on Jehovah

00:32:47.894 --> 00:32:50.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his love of the good news

00:32:50.146 --> 00:32:53.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
has enabled him to maintain his zeal

00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:55.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even as he’s grown older.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing the good news informally

00:32:59.572 --> 00:33:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have powerful results.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to be effective, we need to be prepared.

00:33:05.954 --> 00:33:07.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:33:07.414 --> 00:33:10.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ll see
in this following morning worship,

00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:14.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can learn from the example
of the Great Teacher, Jesus.

00:33:17.007 --> 00:33:19.176 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus, as the Great Teacher,

00:33:19.176 --> 00:33:23.096 line:10% position:50% align:center
created opportunities to witness to others.

00:33:23.096 --> 00:33:25.766 line:10% position:50% align:center
And of course, an excellent example of that

00:33:25.766 --> 00:33:28.226 line:10% position:50% align:center
is found in John chapter 4.

00:33:28.226 --> 00:33:29.895 line:10% position:50% align:center
So if you turn with me, please,

00:33:29.895 --> 00:33:31.897 line:10% position:50% align:center
to John chapter 4,

00:33:31.897 --> 00:33:34.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s analyze how Jesus was able

00:33:34.942 --> 00:33:37.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do informal witnessing,

00:33:37.653 --> 00:33:40.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see what lessons
we can learn from it.

00:33:40.864 --> 00:33:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in looking at John chapter 4,
to get the background,

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that in verses 3-6 it mentions

00:33:46.912 --> 00:33:49.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus left Judea,

00:33:49.707 --> 00:33:52.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was going toward Galilee.

00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:55.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he decided to go through Samaria

00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:58.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ended up in Sychar.

00:33:58.174 --> 00:33:59.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
In looking at the study note,

00:33:59.842 --> 00:34:02.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
we notice that this was a journey

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:07.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
that involved an ascent
of some 3,000 feet (914 m).

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:12.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a very high elevation
to climb up to.

00:34:12.605 --> 00:34:15.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
In rough terms,
we could say it’s like going up

00:34:15.983 --> 00:34:20.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
300 floors, or stories,
in a building.

00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:23.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how you would feel
at the end of that.

00:34:23.116 --> 00:34:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jesus and his apostles
had made that journey that morning,

00:34:27.036 --> 00:34:30.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s no wonder that in verse 6,
it says that he was “tired out.”

00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:33.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was sitting there,
and it mentions in verse 6, too,

00:34:33.668 --> 00:34:36.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was the sixth hour, or about midday.

00:34:36.796 --> 00:34:40.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
So imagine the setting:
Jesus is in Samaria,

00:34:40.884 --> 00:34:45.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s tired,
and it’s about midday

00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:50.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not the best circumstances
for starting to witness.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the first lesson
we learn from this?

00:34:52.729 --> 00:34:56.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus didn’t wait for the perfect opportunity

00:34:56.107 --> 00:34:58.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
to informal witness.

00:34:58.109 --> 00:35:02.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he used whatever opportunity came up
and created opportunities.

00:35:02.531 --> 00:35:04.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, of course, the woman comes along.

00:35:04.783 --> 00:35:07.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 7 how Jesus introduced,

00:35:07.953 --> 00:35:10.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
or started, this conversation.

00:35:10.038 --> 00:35:13.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
He simply said: “Give me a drink.”

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t dive
into some deep spiritual discussion,

00:35:17.254 --> 00:35:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
but rather,
he just started talking to the woman.

00:35:20.757 --> 00:35:23.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what lesson do we learn from that?

00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:27.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, if we’re interested
in witnessing to others informally,

00:35:27.014 --> 00:35:30.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps all it takes
is just greeting them, saying hello.

00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:34.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course, if they’re not even willing
to start talking to us,

00:35:34.813 --> 00:35:37.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very hard to go much further.

00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:39.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the first lesson.

00:35:39.568 --> 00:35:42.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the woman respond?

00:35:42.363 --> 00:35:46.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll notice as we go
through John chapter 4,

00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:50.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were at least four potential problems
that Jesus had to avoid

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:53.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he continued this discussion.

00:35:53.374 --> 00:35:57.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first of these problems
is recorded in verse 9.

00:35:57.211 --> 00:35:59.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
There straightaway she says,

00:35:59.213 --> 00:36:02.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re a Jew,
and I’m a Samaritan woman.

00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:05.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
How come you’re talking to me?’

00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she referred to his appearance,
his background.

00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:11.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar way today,

00:36:11.267 --> 00:36:13.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes someone may take a look at us

00:36:13.269 --> 00:36:18.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and refer to our color
or racial background or nationality.

00:36:18.107 --> 00:36:21.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that could be a negative thing.

00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:23.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus say?

00:36:23.655 --> 00:36:27.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he didn’t respond and say:
‘You know, I’m a nice person.

00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:30.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how come I’m willing to talk to you.’

00:36:30.495 --> 00:36:34.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he completely avoided that whole issue

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:38.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focused on the spiritual message

00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:40.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he wanted to convey to her.

00:36:40.714 --> 00:36:43.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we notice that in verse 10,

00:36:43.675 --> 00:36:47.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
he speaks “of the free gift of God,”

00:36:47.846 --> 00:36:52.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he also mentions
that this woman could get “living water,”

00:36:52.642 --> 00:36:57.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just the water
that she was interested in at that point.

00:36:57.064 --> 00:37:00.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we analyze
how the conversation went,

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:05.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see clearly that Jesus
laid the foundation here at this point

00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:07.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what he was going to say later.

00:37:07.866 --> 00:37:09.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, he started with water.

00:37:09.993 --> 00:37:13.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he mentions God’s gifts
and “living water,”

00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:17.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see how he develops that
a little further as we go on.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what happened at that point
when he offered this “living water”?

00:37:22.965 --> 00:37:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in verse 11, notice she says:
“You do not even have a bucket.”

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in other words,
she was basically saying:

00:37:31.223 --> 00:37:32.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t believe you.

00:37:32.892 --> 00:37:34.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
The well is very deep.’

00:37:34.602 --> 00:37:38.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note says
it’s maybe about 75 feet (23 m) deep.

00:37:38.981 --> 00:37:42.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is a negative reaction on her part,

00:37:42.485 --> 00:37:47.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed up by something else
that was very controversial in Jesus’ day.

00:37:47.156 --> 00:37:51.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says, ‘Do you think you’re better
than our forefather Jacob?’

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was very controversial

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:59.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the average Jew in those days
would have objected to that comment,

00:37:59.168 --> 00:38:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that she wasn’t a relative of Jacob.

00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:06.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here we have
another two possible problems.

00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:09.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus handle it?

00:38:09.012 --> 00:38:13.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he just focused back
on the spiritual message.

00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:16.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we mentioned,
as recorded in verse 10,

00:38:16.436 --> 00:38:20.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
he started with water, God’s gift,
and “living water.”

00:38:20.482 --> 00:38:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then if we look at verse 14,

00:38:23.193 --> 00:38:25.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
he speaks about drinking water

00:38:25.278 --> 00:38:28.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you
would “never get thirsty at all” again.

00:38:28.073 --> 00:38:31.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he introduces
the concept, or thought,

00:38:31.451 --> 00:38:33.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
of everlasting life.

00:38:33.787 --> 00:38:37.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, Jesus had in his mind

00:38:37.499 --> 00:38:40.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
a plan of action, or a little outline,

00:38:40.293 --> 00:38:42.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how he could develop a certain theme.

00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:47.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was to do with water
leading to everlasting life.

00:38:47.634 --> 00:38:50.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did the woman respond
at that point?

00:38:50.554 --> 00:38:55.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, in verse 15, she says:
“Sir, give me this water.”

00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:58.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, was she saying,
‘Please, I really want it’?

00:38:58.854 --> 00:39:03.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was she perhaps a little cynical,
maybe even a little sarcastic?

00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:05.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s hard for us to tell.

00:39:05.486 --> 00:39:09.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t seem until later
that she fully believed Jesus.

00:39:09.323 --> 00:39:11.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever the case,

00:39:11.325 --> 00:39:14.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
it perhaps could,
in a modern setting, be like her saying,

00:39:14.995 --> 00:39:19.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That sounds good,
but it’s too good to be true.’

00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:21.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did that stop Jesus?

00:39:21.335 --> 00:39:22.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:39:22.753 --> 00:39:27.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus then basically changes
the direction of the conversation

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:32.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gives her an opportunity
to show her honesty.

00:39:32.138 --> 00:39:36.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus realized that she was coming
at that time of the day

00:39:36.183 --> 00:39:38.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
to avoid perhaps others seeing her.

00:39:38.936 --> 00:39:39.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:39:39.937 --> 00:39:43.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in verse 16,
Jesus says to her: “Call your husband.”

00:39:43.858 --> 00:39:46.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says:
“I do not have a husband”

00:39:46.778 --> 00:39:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very honest comment to a stranger.

00:39:49.364 --> 00:39:51.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jesus said:
“You are right.

00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:53.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have had five husbands,

00:39:53.701 --> 00:39:56.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the man you now have
is not your husband.

00:39:56.663 --> 00:39:59.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
This you have said truthfully.”

00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:02.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, what do we learn from this?

00:40:02.877 --> 00:40:05.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, although Jesus knew

00:40:05.255 --> 00:40:08.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she was living
in an immoral relationship,

00:40:08.675 --> 00:40:11.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
still, that wasn’t the focus.

00:40:11.553 --> 00:40:14.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave her
an opportunity to express herself,

00:40:14.097 --> 00:40:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then what did he do?

00:40:15.932 --> 00:40:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
He commended her.

00:40:17.934 --> 00:40:22.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in a similar way,
it’s good for us to always try to find points

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can commend the person for,

00:40:24.274 --> 00:40:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if they say something
that is totally opposite

00:40:27.235 --> 00:40:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what the Bible says.

00:40:29.237 --> 00:40:32.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can at least thank them
for expressing their viewpoint

00:40:32.074 --> 00:40:34.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being honest about it.

00:40:34.743 --> 00:40:38.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we continue on,
we then see, at this point,

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
the woman has really taken notice
because she says:

00:40:42.626 --> 00:40:44.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sir, I see that you are a prophet.”

00:40:44.962 --> 00:40:48.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the next problem,
the fourth problem, comes in.

00:40:48.757 --> 00:40:50.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does she say?

00:40:50.592 --> 00:40:53.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, we worship here at Mount Gerizim,

00:40:53.637 --> 00:40:57.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you Jews,
you say we should worship in Jerusalem.’

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, basically,
it’s the modern equivalent of saying,

00:41:00.269 --> 00:41:04.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have my own religion,
and it’s different from yours.’

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:08.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did Jesus deal
with that potential problem?

00:41:08.527 --> 00:41:10.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when we look at verse 21,

00:41:10.529 --> 00:41:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s interesting to see
how he starts the answer by saying:

00:41:15.284 --> 00:41:18.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The hour is coming
when neither on this mountain

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:21.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor in Jerusalem
will you worship the Father.”

00:41:21.958 --> 00:41:25.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, basically,
Jesus was just allaying her concern

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saying: ‘Look, don’t worry.

00:41:27.964 --> 00:41:29.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘In the future,
this is not going to be an issue,

00:41:29.966 --> 00:41:32.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s here or there.’

00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:35.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he goes on to explain
that the important thing is

00:41:35.263 --> 00:41:39.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “worship the Father
with spirit and truth.”

00:41:39.892 --> 00:41:42.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we see from that?

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus tried to help her to see

00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:47.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what she perceived as being a problem

00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:49.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
really wasn’t an issue at all.

00:41:49.694 --> 00:41:54.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t something they had to go through
and explain all the details.

00:41:54.699 --> 00:41:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, he did mention
that “salvation [began] with the Jews,”

00:41:58.787 --> 00:42:03.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then he showed her very clearly
what she needed to do.

00:42:04.084 --> 00:42:07.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why was that so important?

00:42:07.295 --> 00:42:09.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we turn

00:42:09.297 --> 00:42:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the book of Acts 8:14,

00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:15.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a very interesting study note there

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:19.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that tells us
that what Jesus did on this occasion,

00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
in witnessing to this woman
and then to various ones in her community,

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:28.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
laid the basis
for what Philip the evangelizer

00:42:28.442 --> 00:42:30.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
would later do
when he moved to Samaria

00:42:30.986 --> 00:42:34.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped many there to become Christians.

00:42:34.364 --> 00:42:37.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ultimately they became
anointed Christians.

00:42:37.951 --> 00:42:41.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus’ conversation here with this woman

00:42:41.205 --> 00:42:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
certainly was very, very successful.

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:48.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned from this discussion
looking through John chapter 4?

00:42:48.712 --> 00:42:52.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, Jesus didn’t wait
for the perfect opportunity;

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:55.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
he created that opportunity.

00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:58.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, he wasn’t distracted,
or sidetracked,

00:42:58.764 --> 00:43:01.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the various issues
—some of them controversial—

00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this woman raised,

00:43:03.477 --> 00:43:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he focused on a spiritual theme.

00:43:06.522 --> 00:43:09.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had something in mind
where he would use water

00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:13.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to eventually describe everlasting life.

00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he commended her
for her honest remarks

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed her what she needed to do.

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an excellent lesson this is
for all of us

00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:26.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we try to witness to others!

00:43:27.669 --> 00:43:31.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Start simple,
have a theme in mind,

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:33.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commend the person.

00:43:33.216 --> 00:43:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a simple formula!

00:43:35.218 --> 00:43:39.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll want to try this approach
as soon as possible.

00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:41.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we meditate on the good news,

00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:44.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t help but want to share it

00:43:44.352 --> 00:43:46.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
at every possible opportunity.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just can’t hold back!

00:43:50.692 --> 00:43:54.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the theme of this month’s music video.

00:44:08.919 --> 00:44:21.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
The signs we see are clear;
The end of this world is near.

00:44:23.225 --> 00:44:35.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how will they know the way to go
Without a chance to hear?

00:44:37.031 --> 00:44:49.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth we cannot hide.
Our fear we must set aside.

00:44:51.003 --> 00:45:04.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look to God, and pray to fan the flame,
And let it burn inside.

00:45:04.934 --> 00:45:12.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this fire in our bones,
We’ll make his message known.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:17.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
we can’t hold back.

00:45:18.865 --> 00:45:26.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s keep it burning bright
And spread his glorious light.

00:45:26.206 --> 00:45:32.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
we can’t hold back.

00:45:35.882 --> 00:45:40.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t hold back.

00:45:46.768 --> 00:45:58.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s do all we can.
Soon these words of hope will end.

00:46:00.073 --> 00:46:07.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that time has come,
we’ll stand as one;

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:13.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s name
we will defend.

00:46:13.754 --> 00:46:21.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this fire in our bones,
We’ll make his message known.

00:46:21.053 --> 00:46:27.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
we can’t hold back.

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:34.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s keep it burning bright
And spread his glorious light.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:40.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
we can’t hold back.

00:46:44.452 --> 00:46:47.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t hold back.

00:46:48.498 --> 00:46:55.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
So keep the fire burning;
keep it burning strong.

00:46:55.421 --> 00:47:02.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s day is near;
it won’t be long.

00:47:02.428 --> 00:47:07.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s carry on.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:14.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this fire in our bones,
We’ll make his message known.

00:47:14.816 --> 00:47:20.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
we can’t hold back.

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:28.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s keep it burning bright
And spread his glorious light.

00:47:28.496 --> 00:47:34.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
we can’t hold back.

00:47:38.173 --> 00:47:42.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t hold back.

00:47:43.887 --> 00:47:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t hold back.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:57.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t hold back.

00:48:04.033 --> 00:48:06.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it wonderful how our preaching efforts

00:48:06.952 --> 00:48:09.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
may help people accept the good news?

00:48:09.997 --> 00:48:14.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn,
they’ll be moved to share it with others.

00:48:14.043 --> 00:48:17.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a difference
it makes in their lives!

00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:20.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Last month, the first episode

00:48:20.716 --> 00:48:24.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new series <i>Imitate Their Faith</i>

00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:27.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
brought to life much of Abraham’s story.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened next
in the life of this man

00:48:31.352 --> 00:48:33.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
who the Bible refers to

00:48:33.437 --> 00:48:37.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the father of all those having faith”?

00:48:37.275 --> 00:48:39.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out in Part 2.

00:48:41.654 --> 00:48:43.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
One year ago,

00:48:43.573 --> 00:48:45.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told Abraham something

00:48:45.533 --> 00:48:47.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seemed impossible.

00:49:04.219 --> 00:49:06.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
His wife, Sarah, would have a son.

00:49:25.949 --> 00:49:29.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our son, Isaac.

00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:36.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah’s miraculous pregnancy and Isaac’s birth

00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:38.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
were proof that Jehovah’s word

00:49:38.253 --> 00:49:40.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
always comes true.

00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:54.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the rains came down,

00:49:59.525 --> 00:50:02.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
there they were, eight souls,

00:50:02.778 --> 00:50:05.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
safe on the ark.

00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:07.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah protected Noah’s family.

00:50:09.827 --> 00:50:12.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we’re alive today.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know, that’s not the only time.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:22.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
There have been many things that seemed scary.

00:50:25.218 --> 00:50:27.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah always

00:50:27.303 --> 00:50:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes sure his promises come true.

00:50:31.057 --> 00:50:33.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how he helped to protect your mother

00:50:35.937 --> 00:50:38.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Pharaoh wanted to take her as his wife.

00:50:38.982 --> 00:50:42.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how he sent angels to save Lot.

00:50:44.988 --> 00:50:47.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember he caused your birth.

00:50:49.951 --> 00:50:53.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m your father, but Jehovah is your Father too.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are part of his purpose, Isaac.

00:50:58.084 --> 00:51:01.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hard things are going to happen,

00:51:01.004 --> 00:51:04.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
but remember we can always trust Jehovah.

00:51:05.675 --> 00:51:07.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he always keeps his promises.

00:51:07.052 --> 00:51:08.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right!

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the promise Jehovah made to our family?

00:51:11.848 --> 00:51:14.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will give to you

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:16.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to your offspring after you

00:51:16.603 --> 00:51:19.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the land in which you lived as a . . . lasting possession,

00:51:19.856 --> 00:51:22.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will be their God.”

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:25.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come here.

00:51:39.209 --> 00:51:41.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hard things did happen,

00:51:41.128 --> 00:51:43.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in this spiritual household.

00:51:45.132 --> 00:51:48.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am the star. I am the firstborn.

00:51:48.135 --> 00:51:50.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody hates you. Nobody likes you.

00:51:50.262 --> 00:51:52.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our father loves me. The joke is on you, Isaac.

00:51:52.848 --> 00:51:54.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am the firstborn.

00:51:54.975 --> 00:51:57.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one cares about you, not even God.

00:51:57.269 --> 00:51:59.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dancing is for me.

00:52:00.564 --> 00:52:03.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody hates you. Nobody likes you.

00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:06.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
This wasn’t just sibling rivalry.

00:52:06.028 --> 00:52:09.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ishmael’s abusive behavior had broken Sarah’s heart.

00:52:09.782 --> 00:52:11.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, please, please,

00:52:11.826 --> 00:52:15.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
drive out that slave girl and her son.

00:52:23.421 --> 00:52:25.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be displeased

00:52:25.423 --> 00:52:28.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
by what Sarah is saying to you

00:52:28.092 --> 00:52:31.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the boy and about your slave girl.

00:52:31.513 --> 00:52:33.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to her,

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what will be called your offspring

00:52:35.934 --> 00:52:38.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be through Isaac.

00:52:38.311 --> 00:52:40.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the son of the slave girl,

00:52:40.647 --> 00:52:42.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will also make a nation out of him,

00:52:42.857 --> 00:52:45.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he is your offspring.

00:52:54.661 --> 00:52:56.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though it was hard,

00:52:56.955 --> 00:52:58.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham obediently sent Hagar

00:52:58.957 --> 00:53:01.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his son Ishmael away,

00:53:03.045 --> 00:53:05.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting that Jehovah had his eyes upon them.

00:53:22.439 --> 00:53:24.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham!

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here I am!

00:53:28.612 --> 00:53:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, please, your son,

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
your only son whom you so love, Isaac,

00:53:34.577 --> 00:53:36.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and travel to the land of Moriah

00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:39.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
and offer him up there as a burnt offering

00:53:39.999 --> 00:53:42.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
on one of the mountains that I will designate to you.

00:54:36.056 --> 00:54:37.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go.

00:54:41.561 --> 00:54:43.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past,

00:54:43.897 --> 00:54:45.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham had asked God questions

00:54:45.899 --> 00:54:49.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
about some of his judgments and decisions,

00:54:49.528 --> 00:54:52.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now his friendship and trust in Jehovah

00:54:52.823 --> 00:54:54.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
had grown.

00:54:54.449 --> 00:54:56.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t ask anything at all.

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
You stay here with the donkey,

00:55:01.832 --> 00:55:03.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the boy and I will go over there

00:55:03.167 --> 00:55:05.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worship and return to you.

00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Father!

00:55:18.057 --> 00:55:19.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my son!

00:55:21.227 --> 00:55:24.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are the fire and the wood,

00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:26.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
but where is the sheep

00:55:26.357 --> 00:55:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the burnt offering?

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
God himself will provide the sheep

00:55:39.495 --> 00:55:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the burnt offering, my son.

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham, Abraham!

00:57:54.257 --> 00:57:55.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here I am!

00:57:55.592 --> 00:57:58.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not harm the boy,

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not do anything at all to him,

00:58:03.058 --> 00:58:07.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
for now I do know that you are God-fearing

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you have not withheld your son,

00:58:09.689 --> 00:58:12.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
your only one, from me.

00:59:12.336 --> 00:59:14.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by means of your offspring

00:59:14.964 --> 00:59:16.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
all nations of the earth

00:59:16.966 --> 00:59:19.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
will obtain a blessing for themselves

00:59:19.969 --> 00:59:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you have listened to my voice.

00:59:23.806 --> 00:59:25.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham

00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:27.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sarah

00:59:27.435 --> 00:59:28.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Isaac

00:59:28.895 --> 00:59:31.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
all knew they could have full faith in Jehovah.

00:59:33.358 --> 00:59:37.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
His promises to them are promises to us.

00:59:44.619 --> 00:59:48.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we immerse ourselves
in familiar Bible accounts,

00:59:48.331 --> 00:59:52.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
we gain an even deeper appreciation
for their power

00:59:52.043 --> 00:59:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more firmly embed in our hearts

00:59:54.713 --> 00:59:57.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lessons we learn from them.

00:59:57.465 --> 01:00:01.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s postcard,
we’ll visit our brothers in Lesotho,

01:00:01.303 --> 01:00:04.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
a country in the south of Africa.

01:00:04.556 --> 01:00:07.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesotho is over 1,000 meters,

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 3,280 feet, above sea level,

01:00:10.937 --> 01:00:15.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
with some of its mountain peaks
rising three times as high.

01:00:15.525 --> 01:00:18.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
The majority of its two million people,

01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
called Basotho, live in rural areas.

01:00:21.657 --> 01:00:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many herd animals or farm for a living.

01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Weather conditions can change quickly
in Lesotho’s mountainous terrain,

01:00:30.207 --> 01:00:33.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
calling for protection from sudden cold.

01:00:34.336 --> 01:00:38.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the famous Basotho blanket
comes in quite handy,

01:00:38.048 --> 01:00:40.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially in winter 

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the mountains are blanketed in snow.

01:00:43.804 --> 01:00:48.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the good news must be spread
despite cold or heights

01:00:48.267 --> 01:00:52.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our brothers there have been doing
for over 80 years.

01:00:52.021 --> 01:00:54.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1942,

01:00:54.065 --> 01:00:58.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
two Basotho Witnesses
who learned the truth in South Africa

01:00:58.486 --> 01:01:03.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
returned to preach enthusiastically
in this challenging territory.

01:01:03.199 --> 01:01:07.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nine years later,
there were five small congregations

01:01:07.203 --> 01:01:09.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 63 Witnesses.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1960’s and 1970’s,

01:01:11.666 --> 01:01:15.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work continued
thanks to the tireless efforts

01:01:15.712 --> 01:01:17.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
of zealous evangelizers.

01:01:18.298 --> 01:01:21.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, over 3,700 publishers

01:01:21.134 --> 01:01:25.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
conduct over 4,500 Bible studies

01:01:25.221 --> 01:01:27.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
each month.

01:01:27.765 --> 01:01:32.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Lesotho’s population is widely spread
across a challenging terrain,

01:01:32.312 --> 01:01:36.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers exert themselves to preach

01:01:36.358 --> 01:01:39.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever the people live.

01:01:39.027 --> 01:01:41.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our brothers here climb steep paths

01:01:41.947 --> 01:01:44.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to their meetings

01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:47.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
—especially the 78 publishers

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:49.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Mokhotlong Congregation,

01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:53.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
who meet in the highest Kingdom Hall
in southern Africa.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the heights of Lesotho,

01:01:57.295 --> 01:02:01.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters
of the Mokhotlong Congregation

01:02:01.967 --> 01:02:05.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their warmest greetings.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:13.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
