00:00:02 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:06 In this month’s program,
00:00:08 we’ll examine what “the good news” is
00:00:10 and why it’s such a blessing.
00:00:13 We’ll consider how examples from
00:00:15 from the Bible and our modern history encourage us
00:00:18 to declare all of the good news boldly.
00:00:22 We’ll learn from a faithful brother in Rwanda
00:00:26 how we can maintain our zeal for the good news
00:00:29 despite persecution and imprisonment.
00:00:32 And we’ll enjoy a new music video that reminds us
00:00:35 how much joy we can have sharing the good news with others.
00:00:41 This is JW Broadcasting
00:00:44 for October 2023.
00:01:06 As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have a wonderful privilege
00:01:11 —the privilege of “declaring the good news”!
00:01:14 But just what does that good news include?
00:01:18 If we know the answer,
00:01:19 how will that motivate us
00:01:21 to be even more zealous as we declare the good news?
00:01:25 Let’s consider the answers to those questions.
00:01:29 First of all, what is the good news?
00:01:33 We get an idea by looking at how this expression
00:01:35 is used in the Bible.
00:01:38 For example, we read of “the good news of the Kingdom,”
00:01:42 “the good news of God,”
00:01:44 “the good news about Jesus Christ,”
00:01:47 “the good news of the undeserved kindness of God,”
00:01:51 “the good news of peace,”
00:01:53 and the “everlasting good news.”
00:01:57 So we can say that the good news refers
00:01:59 to the rule of God’s Kingdom
00:02:02 and salvation by faith in Jesus.
00:02:06 This includes all the truths about which Jesus spoke
00:02:10 and the disciples wrote.
00:02:12 Through the prophet Isaiah,
00:02:14 Jehovah spoke about the preaching of the good news.
00:02:18 Isaiah’s prophecy described the purpose
00:02:21 and effect of the good news to be preached,
00:02:24 particularly from the time of Messiah’s coming.
00:02:28 Notice what’s recorded at Isaiah 61:1, 2:
00:02:33 “The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me,
00:02:38 “because Jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek.
00:02:42 “He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
00:02:46 “to proclaim liberty to the captives
00:02:49 “and the wide opening of the eyes to the prisoners,
00:02:52 “to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s goodwill
00:02:56 “and the day of vengeance of our God,
00:02:59 to comfort all who mourn.”
00:03:02 This good news would have a positive effect
00:03:05 on those who listened to it.
00:03:07 It would “bind up the brokenhearted”
00:03:10 and “comfort all who mourn.”
00:03:12 This is likely the kind of good news
00:03:14 that we talk about most in our ministry.
00:03:17 The prospect of enjoying everlasting life in an earthly paradise
00:03:22 under the rule of God’s Kingdom
00:03:25 provides hope to our listeners
00:03:27 and motivates them to love Jehovah.
00:03:31 However, the good news also includes something else,
00:03:35 something that we may not talk about as readily in our ministry.
00:03:39 You may have noticed in Isaiah the expression
00:03:43 “and the day of vengeance of our God.”
00:03:46 So there’s more to the good news
00:03:48 than just “the year of Jehovah’s goodwill.”
00:03:51 We see this clearly in the words recorded
00:03:54 at Revelation 14:6, 7:
00:03:59 “And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,
00:04:03 “and he had everlasting good news
00:04:05 “to declare to those who dwell on the earth,
00:04:08 “to every nation and tribe
00:04:10 “and tongue and people.
00:04:12 “He was saying in a loud voice:
00:04:15 “‘Fear God and give him glory,
00:04:18 “‘because the hour of judgment by him has arrived,
00:04:22 “‘so worship the One who made the heaven
00:04:25 “‘and the earth and the sea
00:04:27 and the springs of water.’”
00:04:29 Evidently, the “everlasting good news”
00:04:32 also includes a judgment message.
00:04:35 What is “the hour of judgment” mentioned in this verse?
00:04:40 According to some reference works,
00:04:42 the original language term here rendered “judgment”
00:04:46 refers to a “legal process of judgment,”
00:04:49 a “scrutiny of conduct.”
00:04:52 So God is looking closely at conduct —how people act.
00:04:56 That is the basis for judgment.
00:05:00 “The hour of judgment” mentioned in this verse
00:05:03 includes both the pronouncement
00:05:05 and the execution of divine judgment
00:05:08 against all false religion —Babylon the Great—
00:05:12 and all other parts of Satan’s system of things.
00:05:16 Of course, Babylon the Great and this world’s institutions
00:05:20 have already been judged.
00:05:23 However, their sentence has yet to be carried out.
00:05:26 When will that happen?
00:05:28 Toward the end of “the hour of judgment,”
00:05:32 which will conclude at the climax of the last days
00:05:36 with the destruction of the present wicked system.
00:05:40 That’s why the actions of people today matter so much.
00:05:45 It’s increasingly urgent that we proclaim
00:05:48 the judgment aspect of the good news to them
00:05:51 because the time when God will execute judgment
00:05:55 is fast approaching.
00:05:57 Why, though, can we say that this judgment message
00:06:01 is good news?
00:06:04 It’s good news for honesthearted ones
00:06:06 because it means the end of wickedness,
00:06:09 including all forms of injustice and violence.
00:06:14 For those who are suffering as a result of the bad actions of the wicked,
00:06:18 this judgment will bring great relief!
00:06:22 It will be a clear demonstration of Jehovah’s love and justice.
00:06:27 However, it will be bad news for those who stubbornly refuse
00:06:32 to live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.
00:06:36 In Bible times,
00:06:38 Jehovah warned of various acts of judgment
00:06:41 that he would bring against those
00:06:43 who deliberately disobeyed his commands.
00:06:47 In each case, he informed the affected people
00:06:50 well in advance
00:06:52 and instructed them to make changes
00:06:54 that were in harmony with his will.
00:06:57 To encourage the right response,
00:07:00 he often used his loyal servants on earth
00:07:03 to announce his judgments
00:07:05 and to convey a sense of urgency.
00:07:08 For example, think of Noah.
00:07:11 For years, he fearlessly warned
00:07:13 the immoral and violent people of his day
00:07:16 about a coming global Flood.
00:07:19 He also told them  they needed to do to survive.
00:07:23 What about Moses and Aaron?
00:07:26 Jehovah used them to warn Pharaoh and his servants.
00:07:31 For example, think about the specific warning Jehovah gave
00:07:35 regarding the seventh plague, a devastating hailstorm.
00:07:39 At Exodus 9:18, 19,
00:07:42 we read that Moses and Aaron
00:07:44 gave the people the time and the information they needed
00:07:48 to protect themselves from the storm.
00:07:52 Yes, Jehovah always makes sure
00:07:54 that people have sufficient opportunity to heed his warnings.
00:07:59 Second Peter 3:9 says:
00:08:01 “He does not desire anyone to be destroyed
00:08:04 but desires all to attain to repentance.”
00:08:08 The good news we are now preaching informs people
00:08:11 not only of the marvelous hope for the future that Jehovah offers
00:08:16 but also of what we must do to enjoy that hope.
00:08:20 That’s why we need to let people know
00:08:22 about Jehovah’s soon-to-come judgment.
00:08:26 Notice how the preaching of the good news is tied to divine judgment
00:08:30 at Matthew 24:14:
00:08:33 “And this good news of the Kingdom
00:08:36 “will be preached in all the inhabited earth
00:08:39 “for a witness to all the nations,
00:08:42 and then the end will come.”
00:08:45 Note how the good news serves as “a witness”
00:08:48 to everyone who hears it.
00:08:50 Depending on what they do with it,
00:08:52 it will result in their eventual acquittal
00:08:55 or condemnation.
00:08:57 Just as a court takes time to hear all the facts
00:09:01 and to weigh all the evidence,
00:09:03 Jesus is wisely using his time now
00:09:06 to judge people fairly.
00:09:08 Both he and Jehovah continue to analyze the conduct of individuals
00:09:13 and how they respond to the good news that we’re preaching.
00:09:18 How should what we’ve just considered about the good news affect us?
00:09:23 For one thing, we will not hold back
00:09:26 from sharing all of the good news.
00:09:29 We will talk about the future blessings God has promised
00:09:33 as well as God’s judgment of the wicked,
00:09:36 which will make these blessings possible.
00:09:39 Imagine for a moment that you knew that a dangerous storm
00:09:43 was bearing down on where you lived.
00:09:45 What would you do?
00:09:47 Wouldn’t you try to be as prepared as possible
00:09:50 so that you could successfully weather the storm?
00:09:53 Wouldn’t you warn your family, friends, even neighbors
00:09:56 and try to help them to do the same?
00:09:59 In a similar way,
00:10:01 we try to help as many people as possible
00:10:04 to prepare for the impending execution
00:10:07 of Jehovah’s judgments on this world.
00:10:10 While being tactful,
00:10:12 we do not hold back from letting people know
00:10:14 what they need to do to be saved.
00:10:17 For example, we help our Bible students
00:10:20 to understand what they need to do.
00:10:23 In a frank yet kind way,
00:10:26 we help them to see what changes they need to make
00:10:29 to harmonize their lives with Jehovah’s standards.
00:10:34 Our new study tool, Enjoy Life Forever!,
00:10:37 is designed to help us do such teaching.
00:10:41 It includes several features to help our Bible students qualify
00:10:45 to preach the good news as soon as possible.
00:10:49 For example, at the end of each section,
00:10:52 there is a review with questions, some of which are quite pointed.
00:10:57 Considering these questions with our students
00:11:00 can help them to see what they need to do
00:11:03 to apply what they’ve been learning in their Bible study.
00:11:07 We’ll have an opportunity to watch a video later on in this program
00:11:11 that will demonstrate some of the features in Enjoy Life Forever!
00:11:16 and how we can use them to help our Bible students.
00:11:21 Understanding the importance of the good news
00:11:24 will also motivate us to preach and teach it with urgency!
00:11:29 We’ll strive to have a full share
00:11:31 in all aspects of the ministry available to us.
00:11:35 Rather than taking a casual approach,
00:11:38 we’ll be zealous and “work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah.”
00:11:43 Why?
00:11:44 Because we realize that people’s lives are at stake;
00:11:48 they urgently need to hear the good news
00:11:51 and respond to it.
00:11:53 Of course, we all have different circumstances and abilities.
00:11:58 We know that Jehovah and Jesus take this into account.
00:12:02 In Jesus’ illustration of the talents,
00:12:05 not all the slaves were given the same number of talents.
00:12:09 Rather, the talents were distributed ‘according to their ability.’
00:12:14 This reminds us that Jehovah and Jesus
00:12:17 are aware of our personal situations.
00:12:21 They know what we can reasonably do,
00:12:23 and they never expect anything beyond that.
00:12:27 Nor do they compare us to our fellow brothers and sisters.
00:12:31 Knowing this is very comforting
00:12:34 because we may not always be able to do
00:12:36 all that we want to do in the preaching work.
00:12:39 That’s often the case with our dear older ones
00:12:43 and others who cope with serious limitations.
00:12:47 However, we can all feel confident
00:12:50 that as long as we do our personal best,
00:12:53 Jehovah will be pleased with us.
00:12:55 He’ll never ‘forget our work and the love that we show.’
00:13:00 So may each of us continue to do all that we can
00:13:04 to share the good news —all of the good news!
00:13:08 By doing so, we will experience great joy and contentment
00:13:13 as we participate in this lifesaving work,
00:13:16 helping as many as possible before it’s too late.
00:13:22 Do you sometimes worry, though, how people might react,
00:13:25 especially to a stronger judgment message?
00:13:29 Facing this fear is not new.
00:13:32 God’s people in ancient and modern times have dealt with it too.
00:13:36 In the following demonstration,
00:13:39 let’s see what one brother is moved to do
00:13:41 after meditating on their examples.
00:14:13 Good morning.
00:14:15 Sorry I was running a little behind this morning,
00:14:17 but at least I come bearing gifts.
00:14:19 Oh. No worries.
00:14:20 Thank you. I could really use it today.
00:14:25 Were you also thinking
00:14:27 about that announcement about the special preaching campaign?
00:14:39 Yeah-yeah, I was.
00:14:42 Don’t take what I’m going to say the wrong way,
00:14:45 but
00:14:47 don’t you think the message we’ll be preaching
00:14:49 is pretty harsh?
00:14:53 No, I wouldn’t say that,
00:14:56 but it’s definitely very direct.
00:15:00 I mean, people already get defensive
00:15:02 whenever you challenge their beliefs,
00:15:04 and this is going to be the next level.
00:15:08 This isn’t going to be the easiest message to deliver.
00:15:12 But, you know, it’s not the first time we’ve done this.
00:15:15 Really?
00:15:16 Absolutely.
00:15:17 I don’t know if you remember me telling you
00:15:19 that my family is originally from Quebec,
00:15:22 and my dad was part of an incredibly hard-hitting witness
00:15:25 back in the 1940’s.
00:15:27 I looked this up last night.
00:15:30 He had to distribute a tract that called out
00:15:33 the local religious leaders as hypocrites.
00:15:37 What were they doing?
00:15:38 They were inciting their followers
00:15:41 to mob violence against the Witnesses,
00:15:44 telling them to vandalize our properties,
00:15:46 even getting brothers falsely arrested
00:15:49 and imprisoned.
00:15:51 Wow, and they had to distribute that tract during the violence?
00:15:55 They had to.
00:15:56 Jehovah wanted to show how unjust their actions were.
00:16:03 But I remember my dad telling me—
00:16:06 He said that initially he was pretty terrified.
00:16:11 Yeah, I mean, that’s how I feel.
00:16:13 I’m-I’m terrified.
00:16:17 It’s normal to feel that way.
00:16:20 I’ve been thinking about it myself,
00:16:23 and I thought of an account in Exodus.
00:16:26 It’s where Moses tells the Israelites
00:16:29 to splatter the blood of a ram on their doorposts
00:16:32 in order to avoid the effects of the last plague.
00:16:35 And I thought about how some of the Israelites
00:16:38 might have felt about doing that back then.
00:16:42 That’s all Moses told us.
00:16:44 And everyone has to do this? Every family?
00:16:50 Rams are sacred to the Egyptians!
00:16:53 Yeah, this would be an affront to Amon-Ra.
00:16:55 How are the Egyptians going to react?
00:17:01 I know. I’ve thought about that too.
00:17:04 Does Moses know what he’s asking us to do?
00:17:14 Brothers, I don’t know if we have anything to worry about.
00:17:20 We don’t have anything to fear.
00:17:23 Think of how Jehovah has protected us with these last plagues.
00:17:30 And as for the blood,
00:17:34 it’s not a matter of offending them;
00:17:38 it’s a matter of protecting us.
00:17:41 It’s showing whose side we’re on
00:17:46 —Jehovah’s side.
00:17:51 Looking back, what the Israelites did
00:17:54 was actually good news.
00:17:58 It meant their deliverance,
00:18:00 and it’s the same with any message we bear today.
00:18:04 Let me show you one of my favorite scriptures
00:18:07 at Isaiah 41:10.
00:18:12 It says: “Do not be afraid, for I am with you.
00:18:16 “Do not be anxious, for I am your God.
00:18:19 “I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,
00:18:22 “I will really hold on to you
00:18:24 with my right hand of righteousness.”
00:18:30 The fear we feel is natural.
00:18:33 But remember,
00:18:36 Jehovah was with the Israelites,
00:18:40 he was with my dad,
00:18:43 and he will be with us.
00:18:45 The message we are sharing is good news.
00:18:55 The faithful record of God’s servants, ancient and modern,
00:18:59 strengthens us to carry out our preaching work
00:19:02 and declare the good news.
00:19:05 Meditating on Jehovah’s unfailing support
00:19:08 can help us overcome any fear we may have.
00:19:12 Our Bible students face many challenges
00:19:15 as they learn about the good news.
00:19:17 They may need to make drastic changes to harmonize their lives
00:19:21 with Jehovah’s standards.
00:19:24 This can be difficult.
00:19:26 How can we help them make these changes
00:19:29 so that they can begin sharing the good news alongside us?
00:19:34 Enjoy Life Forever!
00:19:36 has been designed to help us do just that.
00:19:39 Let’s see encouraging evidence
00:19:41 that this powerful tool is really working.
00:19:50 When I heard about the new publication,
00:19:52 the Enjoy Life Forever!  book,
00:19:54 I was very nervous.
00:19:57 It was a change, and sometimes
00:19:59 I don’t like change.
00:20:01 But I knew that it was for the best.
00:20:03 I just needed to try it out.
00:20:07 I hadn’t had a progressive Bible study in years.
00:20:10 But the book—
00:20:11 The way it was designed  was to help me as a teacher.
00:20:16 Once the features of this new publication
00:20:18 were explained,
00:20:19 that it was going to help us to help our Bible students
00:20:22 begin preaching in the ministry
00:20:24 as well as help our Bible students make changes in their everyday lives,
00:20:28 we were really excited
00:20:29 about using those features to help our students to do so.
00:20:33 I like the “Some People Say” section
00:20:36 at the bottom of the lesson
00:20:38 because that helps prepare her for informal witnessing.
00:20:41 It helps them to formulate in their own words
00:20:45 how to defend their faith
00:20:48 or how to preach informally
00:20:49 or use those opportunities
00:20:50 to share what they’ve just learned.
00:20:53 This was her way of learning how to feel comfortable
00:20:56 talking to others about Jehovah
00:20:58 and teaching others about Jehovah.
00:21:01 You’re right away,
00:21:02 from lesson 01 and lesson 02,
00:21:03 encouraging them to recognize
00:21:06 that it’s not just about what they’re learning
00:21:08 but it’s also about what they can share with others.
00:21:11 As the Bible teacher,
00:21:13 it helps us to round out the rough edges
00:21:15 so that when they do speak to others, it’s tactful.
00:21:18 I put her in that place,
00:21:19 like: “What would you say if someone told you that Jesus was God?
00:21:23 How would you answer that question?”
00:21:25 And that went to her heart, and she was able to answer the question.
00:21:28 “Well, I would tell them this. I would say this.”
00:21:30 Because that’s exactly what happened.
00:21:33 She was telling her family about the lessons that she was learning,
00:21:37 the things that she learned from the Bible,
00:21:39 so all along she was informally witnessing
00:21:41 and not realizing that’s what she was doing.
00:21:44 So when you see that connection
00:21:46 between what they’re learning and how they can use what they learn,
00:21:49 it’s just a wonderful feeling
00:21:51 because you recognize that now they’ll be able to teach somebody else.
00:21:58 One thing that the book also does
00:22:01 is that it progressively helps the student
00:22:03 to make changes in their personal life in order to live by Jehovah’s standards.
00:22:08 The section review is a series of questions
00:22:11 that usually has a key question
00:22:14 or a key verse related to that lesson.
00:22:16 So before going on to the next section,
00:22:18 it’s almost like a filter.
00:22:20 It stops them, helps them to review,
00:22:22 and helps the teacher realize,
00:22:24 ‘Hmm, they don’t quite understand that point.’
00:22:27 They are excellent
00:22:28 because they can get the expressions from your student,
00:22:30 and now you can really focus
00:22:33 on what exactly the issues are that they’re having.
00:22:37 I was able to see if she had any gray areas,
00:22:41 if there was a problem, or if she didn’t understand something.
00:22:45 Are they saying, “The book says” or “You taught me this”?
00:22:49 Then you know, ‘OK,
00:22:51 they need to be reminded of the Scriptures,’
00:22:54 and you need to seed that truth
00:22:56 a little bit deeper into their heart.
00:23:00 That’s when I saw my student express herself
00:23:02 and let me know things she was thinking
00:23:05 or things that were bothering her
00:23:07 or that she realized that she needed to make changes with.
00:23:12 The questions are a bit more personal than maybe you would have asked in the past.
00:23:16 They’re a bit more pointed than maybe we have the habit of of asking.
00:23:21 In comparing my questions I used in the past with what’s in the Enjoy Life Forever!  book,
00:23:25 I mean, I wasn’t getting anywhere before.
00:23:29 These questions really help the students speak from their heart,
00:23:33 and I’m so glad they’re there.
00:23:36 It takes time.
00:23:38 It also takes patience and love on our part
00:23:40 to let them make those changes so they can qualify
00:23:44 to become an unbaptized publisher.
00:23:49 This publication, the Enjoy Life Forever!  book,
00:23:51 is like no other.
00:23:53 It makes it much easier for them,
00:23:56 and you can help them much faster to get there.
00:24:00 That book has helped a lot. It has definitely boosted my confidence.
00:24:04 It was designed to just bring people
00:24:06 right into the truth.
00:24:07 She said the book was made especially for her.
00:24:10 When the time came for her
00:24:12 to do the door-to-door ministry, she was ready.
00:24:16 My student has already started
00:24:18 several Bible studies.
00:24:21 This study program has trained him now
00:24:23 to be a Bible teacher.
00:24:28 If you follow everything that’s in the book, it’s like a complete study.
00:24:31 There’s little that we can add ourselves.
00:24:33 It’s all there.
00:24:37 Enjoy Life Forever!  has many well-worded questions,
00:24:41 some of which are quite pointed,
00:24:44 to help our students reason on God’s Word
00:24:47 and to think deeply about the changes
00:24:49 they need to make to please Jehovah.
00:24:52 The publication also shows them how to preach informally
00:24:55 and stresses how important it is for all of us
00:24:59 to share what we know with others.
00:25:02 Everyone who serves Jehovah has the responsibility
00:25:06 to declare all of the good news.
00:25:09 Paul reminded us at 1 Thessalonians 2:2
00:25:13 that we would need boldness to preach the good news
00:25:16 “in the face of much opposition.”
00:25:19 How can we do that?
00:25:21 Let’s learn from
00:25:22 Brother Gaspard Rwakabubu’s experience and see how
00:25:26 he maintained his zeal through persecution
00:25:29 and imprisonment.
00:25:33 During the 1970’s,
00:25:35 the preaching work
00:25:36 was not recognized in Rwanda.
00:25:39 When my family and I
00:25:41 received a letter of invitation
00:25:43 to go serve there,
00:25:44 we were living a good life.
00:25:46 We had some concerns,
00:25:48 but praying to Jehovah
00:25:51 and asking him for direction helped us.
00:25:55 I discussed it with my wife,
00:25:58 and we were both positive about it.
00:26:02 We made a request for legal recognition in 1982,
00:26:07 but instead, I
00:26:09 and two other brothers
00:26:11 were thrown into prison.
00:26:13 One day, on a Sunday,
00:26:15 the archbishop came to the prison,
00:26:18 and he announced,
00:26:20 “Beware of those Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:26:23 As a result of that,
00:26:25 he raised the curiosity of his listeners.
00:26:29 The prisoners wanted some explanations from us
00:26:32 because they could not understand what he meant.
00:26:37 Many began to join our meetings.
00:26:43 The archbishop was not happy.
00:26:46 He grew even angrier.
00:26:48 And in order to stop our activities,
00:26:52 he told his close followers to beat us up
00:26:55 when we attended the following meeting.
00:27:00 Two young prisoners approached us,
00:27:02 and they said,
00:27:04 “Today they plan to beat you up.”
00:27:08 When our meeting time came,
00:27:10 we didn’t show up.
00:27:14 Another religious group came and took our place that night,
00:27:17 so they were the ones who got beaten up.
00:27:19 From that time on, no one disturbed us any longer.
00:27:23 We continued preaching and attending meetings peacefully.
00:27:27 After spending two years in prison,
00:27:30 we were freed.
00:27:34 Outside of prison, the brothers were not free to preach.
00:27:40 Many more brothers and sisters kept being arrested and imprisoned.
00:27:45 Later, I was put in prison again,
00:27:48 and the imprisoned brothers
00:27:50 rejoiced over my presence, saying,
00:27:53 “We now have our circuit overseer visiting us.”
00:27:56 They were very happy.
00:27:58 We started working together
00:28:00 in harmony and preaching.
00:28:03 Each one was assigned a territory.
00:28:06 Some were discouraged,
00:28:08 but I tried to strengthen
00:28:10 and encourage them to hold on to Jehovah.
00:28:15 Then brothers from all over the world
00:28:19 started to write to the head of state.
00:28:23 Letters were coming in huge quantities!
00:28:26 Those letters had a good impact because,
00:28:29 finally, one day
00:28:31 an announcement was made on the radio
00:28:33 by the president himself
00:28:35 saying that he pardoned Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:28:38 The people on the street started shouting at us:
00:28:41 “Jehovah has won!
00:28:43 “Jehovah has won!
00:28:45 He has won!”
00:28:51 The work of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:28:54 was legally recognized in 1992.
00:29:00 Sadly, in 1994,
00:29:03 during the time of genocide,
00:29:05 some of our brothers died
00:29:07 and others faced serious challenges.
00:29:13 Some fled to Goma as refugees.
00:29:17 I received the assignment
00:29:19 to oversee the relief funds that were coming from Kinshasa.
00:29:24 One day,
00:29:25 I had just collected the relief money
00:29:28 for our refugee brothers,
00:29:30 and I was stopped by two policemen.
00:29:33 They possibly thought
00:29:34 that they could get that money.
00:29:37 So they asked me to go with them
00:29:40 to their superior.
00:29:44 As we were walking,
00:29:45 I remembered a prayer
00:29:47 that our daughter Deborah said
00:29:49 during the genocide.
00:29:50 While the whole family was praying silently,
00:29:53 she prayed out loud,
00:29:55 pouring her heart out to Jehovah.
00:29:59 Thanks to that, they refrained from killing us.
00:30:03 This moved me to pray in my heart too.
00:30:08 As soon as I said “Amen,”
00:30:11 the two policemen turned right
00:30:12 and went to meet their colleague.
00:30:15 I also saw in front of me a brother
00:30:18 holding a black suitcase,
00:30:20 looking exactly like the one I had with the money.
00:30:23 I handed him mine, full of money,
00:30:27 and he gave me his with literature inside.
00:30:30 Then without delay, the policemen said:
00:30:32 “Let’s go now.
00:30:33 Let’s go.”
00:30:35 We walked all the way to the chief of police,
00:30:37 but they found nothing.
00:30:40 They were holding their chins in their hands,
00:30:42 saying: “This is a miracle!
00:30:44 How could the money we saw turn into books?”
00:30:48 In all the trials I’ve encountered,
00:30:51 I really saw Jehovah’s powerful hand!
00:30:55 As a house built on a rock
00:30:57 that is struck by storms
00:30:59 (hit by anything)
00:31:01 but remains firm,
00:31:03 we too met with many trying challenges,
00:31:06 but Jehovah continued to make us firm,
00:31:09 just like a house built on a rock.
00:31:14 A scripture found at Isaiah 54:17
00:31:17 explains that in reality
00:31:20 all those fighting against us,
00:31:23 no matter who they are,
00:31:25 will never succeed.
00:31:27 Up until this moment,
00:31:29 although my physical strength is gradually fading,
00:31:32 I feel that the power to serve Jehovah
00:31:35 is growing so much.
00:31:37 In fact, I feel more powerful than ever.
00:31:41 My determination is that no matter the situation,
00:31:45 I will continue to serve Jehovah.
00:31:51 I’ve met Brother Rwakabubu
00:31:53 and personally heard many of his amazing experiences,
00:31:58 some of which he acted out for me.
00:32:01 The experience of his daughter’s prayer can be found
00:32:05 on pages 198 and 199
00:32:07 of the 2012 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:32:12 Brother Rwakabubu’s daughter was six years old
00:32:15 when she prayed in front of a group of soldiers.
00:32:19 The soldiers were planning to kill the entire family,
00:32:22 including Brother Rwakabubu’s five children.
00:32:27 However, her innocent and earnest prayer
00:32:30 touched the hearts of those hardened soldiers.
00:32:34 Today, Brother Rwakabubu deals with various health issues
00:32:39 that resulted from his persecution and imprisonment.
00:32:43 However, Brother Rwakabubu’s reliance on Jehovah
00:32:47 and his love of the good news
00:32:50 has enabled him to maintain his zeal
00:32:53 —even as he’s grown older.
00:32:57 Sharing the good news informally
00:32:59 can have powerful results.
00:33:01 But to be effective, we need to be prepared.
00:33:05 How?
00:33:07 As we’ll see in this following morning worship,
00:33:10 we can learn from the example of the Great Teacher, Jesus.
00:33:17 Jesus, as the Great Teacher,
00:33:19 created opportunities to witness to others.
00:33:23 And of course, an excellent example of that
00:33:25 is found in John chapter 4.
00:33:28 So if you turn with me, please,
00:33:29 to John chapter 4,
00:33:31 let’s analyze how Jesus was able
00:33:34 to do informal witnessing,
00:33:37 and we’ll see what lessons we can learn from it.
00:33:40 So in looking at John chapter 4, to get the background,
00:33:43 we see that in verses 3-6 it mentions
00:33:46 that Jesus left Judea,
00:33:49 and he was going toward Galilee.
00:33:52 But he decided to go through Samaria
00:33:55 and ended up in Sychar.
00:33:58 In looking at the study note,
00:33:59 we notice that this was a journey
00:34:02 that involved an ascent of some 3,000 feet (914 m).
00:34:07 Now, that’s a very high elevation to climb up to.
00:34:12 In rough terms, we could say it’s like going up
00:34:15 300 floors, or stories, in a building.
00:34:20 Imagine how you would feel at the end of that.
00:34:23 So if Jesus and his apostles had made that journey that morning,
00:34:27 it’s no wonder that in verse 6, it says that he was “tired out.”
00:34:30 He was sitting there, and it mentions in verse 6, too,
00:34:33 it was the sixth hour, or about midday.
00:34:36 So imagine the setting: Jesus is in Samaria,
00:34:40 he’s tired, and it’s about midday
00:34:45 —not the best circumstances for starting to witness.
00:34:50 So, what’s the first lesson we learn from this?
00:34:52 Jesus didn’t wait for the perfect opportunity
00:34:56 to informal witness.
00:34:58 No, he used whatever opportunity came up and created opportunities.
00:35:02 So, of course, the woman comes along.
00:35:04 Notice in verse 7 how Jesus introduced,
00:35:07 or started, this conversation.
00:35:10 He simply said: “Give me a drink.”
00:35:13 He didn’t dive into some deep spiritual discussion,
00:35:17 but rather, he just started talking to the woman.
00:35:20 Well, what lesson do we learn from that?
00:35:23 You see, if we’re interested in witnessing to others informally,
00:35:27 perhaps all it takes is just greeting them, saying hello.
00:35:30 And of course, if they’re not even willing to start talking to us,
00:35:34 it’s very hard to go much further.
00:35:37 So that’s the first lesson.
00:35:39 How did the woman respond?
00:35:42 Well, we’ll notice as we go through John chapter 4,
00:35:46 there were at least four potential problems that Jesus had to avoid
00:35:50 as he continued this discussion.
00:35:53 The first of these problems is recorded in verse 9.
00:35:57 There straightaway she says,
00:35:59 ‘You’re a Jew, and I’m a Samaritan woman.
00:36:02 How come you’re talking to me?’
00:36:05 So she referred to his appearance, his background.
00:36:09 Well, in a similar way today,
00:36:11 sometimes someone may take a look at us
00:36:13 and refer to our color or racial background or nationality.
00:36:18 And that could be a negative thing.
00:36:21 But what did Jesus say?
00:36:23 Well, he didn’t respond and say: ‘You know, I’m a nice person.
00:36:27 That’s how come I’m willing to talk to you.’
00:36:30 No, he completely avoided that whole issue
00:36:34 and focused on the spiritual message
00:36:38 that he wanted to convey to her.
00:36:40 So we notice that in verse 10,
00:36:43 he speaks “of the free gift of God,”
00:36:47 and he also mentions that this woman could get “living water,”
00:36:52 not just the water that she was interested in at that point.
00:36:57 Now, when we analyze how the conversation went,
00:37:00 we can see clearly that Jesus laid the foundation here at this point
00:37:05 for what he was going to say later.
00:37:07 You see, he started with water.
00:37:09 Then he mentions God’s gifts and “living water,”
00:37:13 and we’ll see how he develops that a little further as we go on.
00:37:17 Well, what happened at that point when he offered this “living water”?
00:37:22 Well, in verse 11, notice she says: “You do not even have a bucket.”
00:37:27 So in other words, she was basically saying:
00:37:31 ‘I don’t believe you.
00:37:32 The well is very deep.’
00:37:34 The study note says it’s maybe about 75 feet (23 m) deep.
00:37:38 So this is a negative reaction on her part,
00:37:42 followed up by something else that was very controversial in Jesus’ day.
00:37:47 She says, ‘Do you think you’re better than our forefather Jacob?’
00:37:52 Now, that was very controversial
00:37:54 because the average Jew in those days would have objected to that comment,
00:37:59 saying that she wasn’t a relative of Jacob.
00:38:03 So here we have another two possible problems.
00:38:06 How did Jesus handle it?
00:38:09 Well, he just focused back on the spiritual message.
00:38:13 As we mentioned, as recorded in verse 10,
00:38:16 he started with water, God’s gift, and “living water.”
00:38:20 And then if we look at verse 14,
00:38:23 he speaks about drinking water
00:38:25 so that you would “never get thirsty at all” again.
00:38:28 And then he introduces the concept, or thought,
00:38:31 of everlasting life.
00:38:33 So obviously, Jesus had in his mind
00:38:37 a plan of action, or a little outline,
00:38:40 of how he could develop a certain theme.
00:38:42 And that was to do with water leading to everlasting life.
00:38:47 Well, how did the woman respond at that point?
00:38:50 Notice, in verse 15, she says: “Sir, give me this water.”
00:38:55 Now, was she saying, ‘Please, I really want it’?
00:38:58 Or was she perhaps a little cynical, maybe even a little sarcastic?
00:39:03 Well, it’s hard for us to tell.
00:39:05 It doesn’t seem until later that she fully believed Jesus.
00:39:09 But whatever the case,
00:39:11 it perhaps could, in a modern setting, be like her saying,
00:39:14 ‘That sounds good, but it’s too good to be true.’
00:39:19 Did that stop Jesus?
00:39:21 No.
00:39:22 Jesus then basically changes the direction of the conversation
00:39:27 and gives her an opportunity to show her honesty.
00:39:32 Jesus realized that she was coming at that time of the day
00:39:36 to avoid perhaps others seeing her.
00:39:38 Why?
00:39:39 Well, in verse 16, Jesus says to her: “Call your husband.”
00:39:43 She says: “I do not have a husband”
00:39:46 —a very honest comment to a stranger.
00:39:49 Then Jesus said: “You are right.
00:39:51 “You have had five husbands,
00:39:53 “and the man you now have is not your husband.
00:39:56 This you have said truthfully.”
00:39:59 Well, now, what do we learn from this?
00:40:02 You see, although Jesus knew
00:40:05 that she was living in an immoral relationship,
00:40:08 still, that wasn’t the focus.
00:40:11 He gave her an opportunity to express herself,
00:40:14 and then what did he do?
00:40:15 He commended her.
00:40:17 So in a similar way, it’s good for us to always try to find points
00:40:22 that we can commend the person for,
00:40:24 even if they say something that is totally opposite
00:40:27 to what the Bible says.
00:40:29 We can at least thank them for expressing their viewpoint
00:40:32 and being honest about it.
00:40:34 So as we continue on, we then see, at this point,
00:40:38 the woman has really taken notice because she says:
00:40:42 “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.”
00:40:44 But then the next problem, the fourth problem, comes in.
00:40:48 What does she say?
00:40:50 ‘Well, we worship here at Mount Gerizim,
00:40:53 but you Jews, you say we should worship in Jerusalem.’
00:40:57 So, basically, it’s the modern equivalent of saying,
00:41:00 ‘I have my own religion, and it’s different from yours.’
00:41:04 Well, how did Jesus deal with that potential problem?
00:41:08 Well, when we look at verse 21,
00:41:10 it’s interesting to see how he starts the answer by saying:
00:41:15 “The hour is coming when neither on this mountain
00:41:18 nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.”
00:41:21 So, basically, Jesus was just allaying her concern
00:41:25 and saying: ‘Look, don’t worry.
00:41:27 ‘In the future, this is not going to be an issue,
00:41:29 whether it’s here or there.’
00:41:32 And then he goes on to explain that the important thing is
00:41:35 to “worship the Father with spirit and truth.”
00:41:39 So, what do we see from that?
00:41:42 Jesus tried to help her to see
00:41:44 that what she perceived as being a problem
00:41:47 really wasn’t an issue at all.
00:41:49 It wasn’t something they had to go through and explain all the details.
00:41:54 Of course, he did mention that “salvation [began] with the Jews,”
00:41:58 but then he showed her very clearly what she needed to do.
00:42:04 Now, why was that so important?
00:42:07 Well, if we turn
00:42:09 to the book of Acts 8:14,
00:42:13 there’s a very interesting study note there
00:42:15 that tells us that what Jesus did on this occasion,
00:42:19 in witnessing to this woman and then to various ones in her community,
00:42:24 laid the basis for what Philip the evangelizer
00:42:28 would later do when he moved to Samaria
00:42:30 and helped many there to become Christians.
00:42:34 And ultimately they became anointed Christians.
00:42:37 So Jesus’ conversation here with this woman
00:42:41 certainly was very, very successful.
00:42:44 So, what have we learned from this discussion looking through John chapter 4?
00:42:48 First of all, Jesus didn’t wait for the perfect opportunity;
00:42:52 he created that opportunity.
00:42:55 Second, he wasn’t distracted, or sidetracked,
00:42:58 by the various issues —some of them controversial—
00:43:01 that this woman raised,
00:43:03 but he focused on a spiritual theme.
00:43:06 He had something in mind where he would use water
00:43:09 to eventually describe everlasting life.
00:43:13 And then he commended her for her honest remarks
00:43:17 and showed her what she needed to do.
00:43:20 What an excellent lesson this is for all of us
00:43:23 as we try to witness to others!
00:43:27 Start simple, have a theme in mind,
00:43:31 and commend the person.
00:43:33 What a simple formula!
00:43:35 I’m sure you’ll want to try this approach as soon as possible.
00:43:39 When we meditate on the good news,
00:43:41 we can’t help but want to share it
00:43:44 at every possible opportunity.
00:43:46 We just can’t hold back!
00:43:50 That’s the theme of this month’s music video.
00:44:08 The signs we see are clear; The end of this world is near.
00:44:23 But how will they know the way to go Without a chance to hear?
00:44:37 The truth we cannot hide. Our fear we must set aside.
00:44:51 Look to God, and pray to fan the flame, And let it burn inside.
00:45:04 With this fire in our bones, We’ll make his message known.
00:45:12 We know we can’t hold back.
00:45:18 So let’s keep it burning bright And spread his glorious light.
00:45:26 We know we can’t hold back.
00:45:35 We can’t hold back.
00:45:46 So let’s do all we can. Soon these words of hope will end.
00:46:00 When that time has come, we’ll stand as one;
00:46:07 God’s name we will defend.
00:46:13 With this fire in our bones, We’ll make his message known.
00:46:21 We know we can’t hold back.
00:46:27 So let’s keep it burning bright And spread his glorious light.
00:46:34 We know we can’t hold back.
00:46:44 We can’t hold back.
00:46:48 So keep the fire burning; keep it burning strong.
00:46:55 Jehovah’s day is near; it won’t be long.
00:47:02 Let’s carry on.
00:47:07 With this fire in our bones, We’ll make his message known.
00:47:14 We know we can’t hold back.
00:47:20 So let’s keep it burning bright And spread his glorious light.
00:47:28 We know we can’t hold back.
00:47:38 We can’t hold back.
00:47:43 We can’t hold back.
00:47:52 We can’t hold back.
00:48:04 Isn’t it wonderful how our preaching efforts
00:48:06 may help people accept the good news?
00:48:09 In turn, they’ll be moved to share it with others.
00:48:14 And what a difference it makes in their lives!
00:48:17 Last month, the first episode
00:48:20 in the new series Imitate Their Faith
00:48:24 brought to life much of Abraham’s story.
00:48:27 But what happened next in the life of this man
00:48:31 who the Bible refers to
00:48:33 as “the father of all those having faith”?
00:48:37 Let’s find out in Part 2.
00:48:41 One year ago,
00:48:43 Jehovah told Abraham something
00:48:45 that seemed impossible.
00:49:04 His wife, Sarah, would have a son.
00:49:25 Our son, Isaac.
00:49:32 Sarah’s miraculous pregnancy and Isaac’s birth
00:49:36 were proof that Jehovah’s word
00:49:38 always comes true.
00:49:52 As the rains came down,
00:49:59 there they were, eight souls,
00:50:02 safe on the ark.
00:50:05 Jehovah protected Noah’s family.
00:50:09 That’s why we’re alive today.
00:50:16 And you know, that’s not the only time.
00:50:19 There have been many things that seemed scary.
00:50:25 But Jehovah always
00:50:27 makes sure his promises come true.
00:50:31 Think how he helped to protect your mother
00:50:35 when Pharaoh wanted to take her as his wife.
00:50:38 Think how he sent angels to save Lot.
00:50:44 Remember he caused your birth.
00:50:49 I’m your father, but Jehovah is your Father too.
00:50:55 You are part of his purpose, Isaac.
00:50:58 Hard things are going to happen,
00:51:01 but remember we can always trust Jehovah.
00:51:05 Because he always keeps his promises.
00:51:07 That’s right!
00:51:08 Remember the promise Jehovah made to our family?
00:51:11 “I will give to you
00:51:14 “and to your offspring after you
00:51:16 “the land in which you lived as a . . . lasting possession,
00:51:19 and I will be their God.”
00:51:24 Come here.
00:51:39 Hard things did happen,
00:51:41 even in this spiritual household.
00:51:45 I am the star. I am the firstborn.
00:51:48 Everybody hates you. Nobody likes you.
00:51:50 Our father loves me. The joke is on you, Isaac.
00:51:52 I am the firstborn.
00:51:54 No one cares about you, not even God.
00:51:57 The dancing is for me.
00:52:00 Everybody hates you. Nobody likes you.
00:52:03 This wasn’t just sibling rivalry.
00:52:06 Ishmael’s abusive behavior had broken Sarah’s heart.
00:52:09 Please, please, please,
00:52:11 drive out that slave girl and her son.
00:52:23 Do not be displeased
00:52:25 by what Sarah is saying to you
00:52:28 about the boy and about your slave girl.
00:52:31 Listen to her,
00:52:33 for what will be called your offspring
00:52:35 will be through Isaac.
00:52:38 As for the son of the slave girl,
00:52:40 I will also make a nation out of him,
00:52:42 because he is your offspring.
00:52:54 Though it was hard,
00:52:56 Abraham obediently sent Hagar
00:52:58 and his son Ishmael away,
00:53:03 trusting that Jehovah had his eyes upon them.
00:53:22 Abraham!
00:53:26 Here I am!
00:53:28 Take, please, your son,
00:53:31 your only son whom you so love, Isaac,
00:53:34 and travel to the land of Moriah
00:53:36 and offer him up there as a burnt offering
00:53:39 on one of the mountains that I will designate to you.
00:54:36 Let’s go.
00:54:41 In the past,
00:54:43 Abraham had asked God questions
00:54:45 about some of his judgments and decisions,
00:54:49 but now his friendship and trust in Jehovah
00:54:52 had grown.
00:54:54 He didn’t ask anything at all.
00:54:59 You stay here with the donkey,
00:55:01 but the boy and I will go over there
00:55:03 and worship and return to you.
00:55:16 Father!
00:55:18 Yes, my son!
00:55:21 Here are the fire and the wood,
00:55:24 but where is the sheep
00:55:26 for the burnt offering?
00:55:37 God himself will provide the sheep
00:55:39 for the burnt offering, my son.
00:57:51 Abraham, Abraham!
00:57:54 Here I am!
00:57:55 Do not harm the boy,
00:57:58 and do not do anything at all to him,
00:58:03 for now I do know that you are God-fearing
00:58:07 because you have not withheld your son,
00:58:09 your only one, from me.
00:59:12 And by means of your offspring
00:59:14 all nations of the earth
00:59:16 will obtain a blessing for themselves
00:59:19 because you have listened to my voice.
00:59:23 Abraham
00:59:25 and Sarah
00:59:27 and Isaac
00:59:28 all knew they could have full faith in Jehovah.
00:59:33 His promises to them are promises to us.
00:59:44 When we immerse ourselves in familiar Bible accounts,
00:59:48 we gain an even deeper appreciation for their power
00:59:52 and more firmly embed in our hearts
00:59:54 the lessons we learn from them.
00:59:57 In this month’s postcard, we’ll visit our brothers in Lesotho,
01:00:01 a country in the south of Africa.
01:00:04 Lesotho is over 1,000 meters,
01:00:07 or 3,280 feet, above sea level,
01:00:10 with some of its mountain peaks rising three times as high.
01:00:15 The majority of its two million people,
01:00:18 called Basotho, live in rural areas.
01:00:21 Many herd animals or farm for a living.
01:00:24 Weather conditions can change quickly in Lesotho’s mountainous terrain,
01:00:30 calling for protection from sudden cold.
01:00:34 So the famous Basotho blanket comes in quite handy,
01:00:38 especially in winter
01:00:40 when the mountains are blanketed in snow.
01:00:43 Of course, the good news must be spread despite cold or heights
01:00:48 as our brothers there have been doing for over 80 years.
01:00:52 In 1942,
01:00:54 two Basotho Witnesses who learned the truth in South Africa
01:00:58 returned to preach enthusiastically in this challenging territory.
01:01:03 Nine years later, there were five small congregations
01:01:07 with 63 Witnesses.
01:01:09 In the 1960’s and 1970’s,
01:01:11 the work continued thanks to the tireless efforts
01:01:15 of zealous evangelizers.
01:01:18 Today, over 3,700 publishers
01:01:21 conduct over 4,500 Bible studies
01:01:25 each month.
01:01:27 Because Lesotho’s population is widely spread across a challenging terrain,
01:01:32 our brothers exert themselves to preach
01:01:36 wherever the people live.
01:01:39 Many of our brothers here climb steep paths
01:01:41 to get to their meetings
01:01:44 —especially the 78 publishers
01:01:47 of the Mokhotlong Congregation,
01:01:49 who meet in the highest Kingdom Hall in southern Africa.
01:01:54 From the heights of Lesotho,
01:01:57 the brothers and sisters of the Mokhotlong Congregation
01:02:01 send you their warmest greetings.
01:02:05 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
