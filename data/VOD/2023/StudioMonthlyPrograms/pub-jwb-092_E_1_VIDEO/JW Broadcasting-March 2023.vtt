00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:09.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a preview of what we’ll discover
in this month’s program.

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:13.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wanted to turn back time

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and undo something
you wish you hadn’t done?

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s <i>My Teen Life,</i>

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll hear how Thalila and José,

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
who each with help
from their parents and Jehovah,

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
made progress after a setback.

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’ve strayed far from Jehovah,

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
our own heart may make us feel

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
like we could never come back.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:36.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:38.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
will remind us how great

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love is
for those who want to return to him.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a brother once served as an elder
but is not presently,

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:50.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
what can help him to regain his privileges?

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll hear the experiences of two brothers

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a segment
with this thought-provoking title: 

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:59.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Return and Serve Again! </i>

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s much to look forward to

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this March 2023 edition
of JW Broadcasting®.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever set a goal for yourself

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was harder to reach
than you first thought?

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did that make you feel?

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this dramatization,

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
note the adjustments a sister makes
to work toward her goal.

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:46.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was terrible.

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:48.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could’ve answered that better.

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:52.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you did great, really.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve always been hard on myself.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
... strengthen our faith.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then if we,

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:03.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
um, um—

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that’s all.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it made me so anxious

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even the normal stuff I did

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt impossible.

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:35.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you think brings this on?

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know, maybe—

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:44.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe lately it’s
because I’m thinking about SKE.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I can reach that goal, it’ll be fine.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see.

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about we read
a scripture that might help?

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:02:56.993 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t discourage me from SKE.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:03.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they suggested
that I try to manage the anxiety first.

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:07.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was on it!

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:11.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I focused on my goal

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took care of myself, I’d get there.

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:35.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it was a little too much focus.

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers.

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:57.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So?

00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re right.

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
SKE would be a lot for me right now.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:03.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, but you’ll get there.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried everything to fix this.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong with me?

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:15.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:17.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some things just take time.

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:20.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, I have Lilly’s study tomorrow morning.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could use your help.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to get baptized,

00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:37.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t know.

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:40.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
You all do so much.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:46.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think I could ever really be . . .

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I show you something?

00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Micah 6:8

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
—would you read that?

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has told you, O man, what is good.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And what is
Jehovah requiring of you?

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Only to exercise justice,
to cherish loyalty,

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:19.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
That last part, “walk in modesty,”

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:27.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s about knowing our limitations.

00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:30.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
So is Jehovah happy

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
with what you can do,

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:36.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
or does he want what you can’t do?

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
He only expects what I can do.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:46.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then why should we expect more?

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turns out I gave Lilly
the same advice the brothers gave me.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was my turn to apply it.

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:57.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to be honest with myself.

00:05:57.573 --> 00:06:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
My limitation was my own high expectation.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d been doing it so long
that there was no quick fix.

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t mean giving up on my goals, though.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just tried to focus more
on what I could do in the present,

00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
like having more empathy
for people who feel like I do

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:30.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showing them
how much Jehovah values them.

00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:39.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could tell a Bible student how we, um,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we overcame a challenge.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:43.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
That might . . .

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:47.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is,
I can actually do a lot for Jehovah

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
with reasonable expectations.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister learned to manage her anxiety,

00:06:59.602 --> 00:07:03.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
in part,
by managing her expectations

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a crucial step
to giving her best to Jehovah.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:13.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
That lesson is an excellent introduction
to this month’s theme:

00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:15.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Realistic Expectations

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:19.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
—The Key to Joyful and Successful Service.”

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
When you hear the word “realistic,”

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.062 line:10% position:50% align:center
what comes to your mind?

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Realistic” conveys the idea
of something that is practical,

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:33.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
rational, reasonable, and sensible.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:37.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having expectations that are realistic

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential to joy 
and success in Jehovah’s service.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:47.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, unrealistic expectations

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:49.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
cause discouragement,

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Proverbs 13:12 says:

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:56.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Expectation postponed makes the heart sick,

00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:00.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a desire realized is a tree of life.”

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appropriately, we often use this verse

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
when referring to expectations

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:10.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are not achieved 
as quickly as we would like.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, expectations that are too high

00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also make our heart sick.

00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:24.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice this quote
from the August 8, 1983, issue of <i> Awake!: </i>

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:28.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Disappointment is often not so much a matter

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of ‘expectation postponed,’

00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:33.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as expectations too high.

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now at times it is good to have high goals,

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to ‘aim for the stars.’

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But <i>always </i> expecting to come out on top

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a surefire way to beckon disappointment.”

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:49.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
To avoid disappointment,

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:53.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
our expectations should be
reasonable and sensible.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our discussion,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:01.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to answer the following
three questions about our expectations:

00:09:02.592 --> 00:09:06.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Why must we be realistic

00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what we expect from ourselves?

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:13.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Why must we be realistic

00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:16.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we expect 
from our brothers and sisters?

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:21.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Why is it realistic to expect

00:09:21.844 --> 00:09:26.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will reward us 
for our faithful sacred service?

00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:30.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our first question is,

00:09:30.386 --> 00:09:35.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why must we be realistic 
about what we expect from ourselves?

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:41.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we love Jehovah
with our whole heart, mind, and soul,

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:44.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to do everything for his glory.

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:48.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the reality is

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter how much we love Jehovah
and want to obey him,

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are sinful descendants of Adam.

00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:57.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:09:57.046 --> 00:10:01.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
we occasionally transgress in thought,
word, and deed.

00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 7:20 states:

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:07.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For there is no righteous man on earth

00:10:07.957 --> 00:10:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
who always does good and never sins.”

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
And James 3:2 reads:

00:10:14.297 --> 00:10:18.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we all stumble many times.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone does not stumble in word,

00:10:20.636 --> 00:10:22.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is a perfect man.”

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:26.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can relate 
to the feelings of the apostle Paul

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:30.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 7:18-20:

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:34.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I know that in me,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is, in my flesh,

00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:39.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there dwells nothing good;

00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I have the desire to do what is fine

00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but not the ability to carry it out.

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:49.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I do not do the good that I wish,

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:51.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the bad that I do not wish

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is what I practice.

00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, then, I do what I do not wish,

00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am no longer the one carrying it out,

00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:03.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it is the sin dwelling in me.”

00:11:03.713 --> 00:11:08.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s struggle with his sinful flesh
made him feel miserable.

00:11:09.452 --> 00:11:10.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times,

00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:13.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
we too might feel dejected,

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
disappointed, 
and frustrated over our shortcomings.

00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:21.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may begin to feel like a failure.

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:27.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
What enabled Paul to continue
serving Jehovah with joy and zeal?

00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:32.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
He honestly acknowledged his sinful condition

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had complete confidence
in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul went on to say at Romans 7:24, 25:

00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:45.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Miserable man that I am!

00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:47.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will rescue me

00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:50.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the body undergoing this death?

00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!”

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness

00:11:58.434 --> 00:12:01.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his loving provision of the ransom,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can confidently remain in Jehovah’s love

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:07.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and render worship that’s acceptable to him,

00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:09.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in our imperfect state.

00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:16.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
How powerful is the ransom
in allowing us to have a clean conscience

00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:19.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and retain Jehovah’s approval?

00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:22.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 3:19 answers this question:

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:25.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Repent, therefore,

00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:28.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and turn around so as to get your sins

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:32.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“blotted out,
so that seasons of refreshing

00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:34.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
may come from Jehovah himself.”

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:38.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original-language word
translated “blotted out”

00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:42.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “to cause to disappear by wiping,”

00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:45.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to remove so as to leave no trace.”

00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:49.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah completely wipes out our sin.

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:52.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:55.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a white writing surface

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
representing our clean standing
before Jehovah.

00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:02.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now imagine that red dots are drawn on it,

00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:04.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
representing our sins.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should not view the ransom
as if Jehovah draws an <i> X</i>

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
over each dot to cross them out.

00:13:11.507 --> 00:13:14.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those red dots would still be visible.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we should imagine Jehovah,

00:13:17.646 --> 00:13:22.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the ransom,
completely erasing the red dots

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:25.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that a clean, 
white writing surface is restored.

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:31.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah further reassures us 
of the completeness of his forgiveness

00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the words recorded at Psalm 103:12-14.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah ‘remembers that we are dust’

00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:45.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
and does not expect perfection from us.

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:49.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a merciful Father,

00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:53.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
he puts our sins “as far off 
as the sunrise is from the sunset.”

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:59.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if a servant of Jehovah 
commits a serious sin,

00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:04.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he is truly repentant with godly sadness,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
his sin can be blotted out,

00:14:07.463 --> 00:14:09.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely forgiven.

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, it is essential for us to maintain

00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:17.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reasonable, sensible,

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:20.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
realistic view of our imperfect state.

00:14:22.044 --> 00:14:24.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to make mistakes,

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:28.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we must have full trust in the reality

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s forgiveness based on the ransom.

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:36.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, we can learn valuable lessons 
from our errors

00:14:36.692 --> 00:14:39.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’ll be less likely to repeat them.

00:14:41.196 --> 00:14:43.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need patience, though,

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:46.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
because some personality flaws and bad habits

00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:48.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not go away overnight.

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:54.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them may even be a lifelong battle.

00:14:55.844 --> 00:14:59.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we may need counsel and discipline.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should we realistically expect
when receiving discipline?

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:08.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 12:11-13

00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes it clear 
that initially it will not “be joyous.”

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:16.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is painful”!

00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:20.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when we humbly accept discipline

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and apply the counsel,

00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:25.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be sure that we will gain inner peace

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be a better servant of Jehovah.

00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, do not give up,

00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:35.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
but keep making progress.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:40.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never allow the Devil 
to convince you that you are a failure.

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:45.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated in the September 1, 2001,

00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:48.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
issue of <i> The Watchtower,</i>  on page 18:

00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:54.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Satan would like nothing better 
than to rob you of your peace . . . .

00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:57.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He would surely like you 
to feel that your imperfection

00:15:57.272 --> 00:16:00.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“makes your service unacceptable to God.

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:04.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never allow the Devil to demoralize you!”

00:16:05.914 --> 00:16:09.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our second question for consideration is,

00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:11.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why must we be realistic

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we expect
from our brothers and sisters?

00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:20.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as it’s essential
to avoid having expectations

00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:22.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are too high for ourselves,

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:27.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must also avoid expecting too much
from our brothers and sisters.

00:16:28.303 --> 00:16:32.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such unreasonable expectations create stress,

00:16:32.274 --> 00:16:35.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
disappointment, and frustration.

00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:39.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i> Awake!</i>  of September 8, 1994,

00:16:39.782 --> 00:16:42.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
quoted a factory supervisor who said:

00:16:43.886 --> 00:16:47.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have to accept people as they are.

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:50.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you expect more than they can give,

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:52.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you] will elevate the stress level,

00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:55.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
making everyone unhappy.”

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should expect from our fellow workers

00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:03.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah and Jesus expect from them.

00:17:05.007 --> 00:17:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ illustration of the talents,

00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:11.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded in Matthew chapter 25,
conveys their thinking.

00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:17.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
The main point of this illustration
is that the Master, Jesus,

00:17:17.653 --> 00:17:20.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
expects each of his anointed brothers

00:17:20.889 --> 00:17:25.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the slaves and, by extension,
those who are of the other sheep—

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:28.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do his or her best

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:32.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the assigned work
of preaching the good news.

00:17:33.569 --> 00:17:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus distribute the work?

00:17:36.672 --> 00:17:41.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 25:15 provides the answer:

00:17:41.777 --> 00:17:45.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He gave five talents to one,

00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:47.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“two to another,

00:17:47.449 --> 00:17:50.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and one to still another,

00:17:50.085 --> 00:17:53.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to each according to his own ability,

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:55.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he went abroad.”

00:17:55.758 --> 00:17:59.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are pleased with

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will reward each of us

00:18:01.797 --> 00:18:06.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we do our best
within our circumstances and ability.

00:18:07.236 --> 00:18:10.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the slave with two talents 
gained two more,

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:13.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
the master did not say to him,

00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:17.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why did you not gain five more 
like your fellow slave?’

00:18:17.379 --> 00:18:21.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave the two-talent slave
the same commendation

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:26.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the one who was given the five
and gained five more:

00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:31.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well done, good and faithful slave!

00:18:31.627 --> 00:18:34.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You were faithful over a few things.

00:18:34.229 --> 00:18:37.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will appoint you over many things.

00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enter into the joy of your master.”

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:46.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two-talent slave
could be just as successful

00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:50.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joyful as the five-talent slave.

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
They both met
their master’s reasonable expectations,

00:18:55.317 --> 00:18:57.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their master was joyful too.

00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:01.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a fine lesson for all of us,

00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:04.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
including those serving as elders!

00:19:04.293 --> 00:19:07.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
In imitation of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:19:07.963 --> 00:19:11.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should never put pressure on our brothers

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do more than they’re capable of doing.

00:19:14.603 --> 00:19:18.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Failure to take this reasonable
and realistic approach

00:19:18.307 --> 00:19:21.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
can result in much frustration.

00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:27.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way that we show 
we have reasonable expectations

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to acknowledge 
that from time to time disagreements

00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:35.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hurt feelings
will arise among our brothers.

00:19:35.224 --> 00:19:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard someone say,

00:19:37.626 --> 00:19:42.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I expect to be treated that way
by the world, but not by my brother”?

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it reasonable to expect

00:19:45.033 --> 00:19:48.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there will not be any 
difficulties among brothers?

00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:50.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:19:50.639 --> 00:19:52.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jesus expect that at times

00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:56.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
his disciples will have difficulties 
among themselves?

00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:58.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:58.513 --> 00:20:00.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say this?

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember some of the expressions

00:20:03.652 --> 00:20:06.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used throughout
the Sermon on the Mount:

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:12.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the peacemakers, 
since they will be called sons of God.”

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:16.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If . . . you are bringing 
your gift to the altar

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:21.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and there you remember
that your brother has something against you,

00:20:21.336 --> 00:20:25.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“leave your gift there in front of the altar, 
and go away.

00:20:26.275 --> 00:20:29.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“First make your peace with your brother,

00:20:29.745 --> 00:20:32.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then come back and offer your gift.”

00:20:34.216 --> 00:20:36.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forgive us our debts,

00:20:36.351 --> 00:20:39.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we also have forgiven our debtors.”

00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:45.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop judging that you may not be judged.”

00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:49.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
These verses show
that Jesus knew his disciples

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have challenges among themselves.

00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:55.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a realistic expectation.

00:20:56.939 --> 00:21:00.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s also reasonable 
to conclude that these problems

00:21:00.242 --> 00:21:05.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be successfully resolved 
if godly principles are applied.

00:21:05.213 --> 00:21:08.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then peace can be restored.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:11.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we should expect some tensions

00:21:11.653 --> 00:21:14.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arise among the brotherhood today.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by applying Bible principles,

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:20.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace can be restored and maintained.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:24.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll now consider our third question:

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:29.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it realistic to expect
that Jehovah will reward us

00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our faithful sacred service?

00:21:33.008 --> 00:21:35.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 11:6, 

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible tells us that Jehovah

00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:40.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the rewarder 
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at 1 Corinthians 15:58,

00:21:44.853 --> 00:21:46.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul encourages us

00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:50.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have “plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:54.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that your labor is not in vain.”

00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:59.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul was absolutely sure
of his heavenly reward.

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:03.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite his sins 
prior to becoming a Christian

00:22:03.372 --> 00:22:06.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his battles with sinful inclinations,

00:22:06.675 --> 00:22:08.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
please note his confidence

00:22:08.777 --> 00:22:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed at 2 Timothy 4:7, 8:

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:17.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have fought the fine fight,

00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:20.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have run the race to the finish,

00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:22.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have observed the faith.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From this time on,

00:22:24.493 --> 00:22:27.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there is reserved for me 
the crown of righteousness,

00:22:27.996 --> 00:22:30.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which the Lord, the righteous judge,

00:22:30.499 --> 00:22:33.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will give me as a reward in that day,

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet not to me only,

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:39.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to all those
who have loved his manifestation.”

00:22:40.375 --> 00:22:45.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can have similar confidence
in the reward Jehovah has promised,

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether our hope is heavenly

00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:51.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to enjoy everlasting life 
on a paradise earth!

00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:56.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a realistic expectation

00:22:56.258 --> 00:23:00.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our reasonable and loving God
has promised it,

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he does not lie.

00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:06.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, may we develop

00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain
realistic expectations for ourselves

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:13.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for our fellow workers.

00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:16.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never lose sight of the reality

00:23:16.678 --> 00:23:20.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
will reward “those earnestly seeking him.”

00:23:22.217 --> 00:23:24.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have realistic expectations,

00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:29.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can find joy and success
in our service to Jehovah now,

00:23:29.558 --> 00:23:34.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as have the prospect
of doing so forever.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones,
no doubt you have many expectations

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:46.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the life that lies ahead of you.

00:23:46.141 --> 00:23:49.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be assured
that Jehovah wants the best for you

00:23:49.478 --> 00:23:53.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will give you holy spirit
and the direction you need

00:23:53.381 --> 00:23:55.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make good choices.

00:23:56.918 --> 00:23:59.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can you do if you make a decision

00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:04.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in the end
disappoints you or those who love you?

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:07.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch this next episode:

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:11.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>My Teen Life</i>
<i>—How Can I Fix My Mistakes? </i>

00:24:20.342 --> 00:24:23.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
I started to make a lot of friends at school,

00:24:23.178 --> 00:24:26.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and aside from school,
I began learning how to Rollerblade.

00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:30.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whenever I’d go out to practice,
I’d meet lots of different people.

00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:33.188 line:10% position:50% align:center
I made some mistakes

00:24:33.188 --> 00:24:34.923 line:10% position:50% align:center
because of bad associations.

00:24:34.923 --> 00:24:38.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started going out at night
and maybe just drinking a little alcohol.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
But eventually, we were drinking a lot.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time I realized what was happening,

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:46.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was already really involved.

00:24:46.234 --> 00:24:48.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was 17 years old.

00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:50.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started being close friends with them.

00:24:50.238 --> 00:24:52.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were everything to me,
and I really trusted them.

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:55.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were doing some wrong things

00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:58.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
like doing drugs and using bad language.

00:24:58.947 --> 00:25:00.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought: ‘I’m just with them.

00:25:00.949 --> 00:25:04.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as I don’t do what they’re doing,
it’s not a problem.’

00:25:09.824 --> 00:25:14.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began to make excuses,
saying that it didn’t really matter

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:16.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that there wasn’t anything wrong
with what I was doing.

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:19.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
My spiritual routine
was just going to the meetings.

00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started missing some meetings.

00:25:22.037 --> 00:25:25.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never prayed.
I didn’t even know how to do personal study.

00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:27.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t reading the Bible every day.

00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:29.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this group of friends,

00:25:29.744 --> 00:25:33.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a boy who liked me
and asked me out.

00:25:33.481 --> 00:25:36.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since all my friends were dating,
I thought, ‘Why not?’

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:40.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started dating him,
and my parents had no idea.

00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:43.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d lie about where I was going,
what I’d be doing, and who I’d be with.

00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:46.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was pretty much
two completely different people.

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:50.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
At home, I was one way,
and with my friends, I was another.

00:25:50.165 --> 00:25:53.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to pray to Jehovah,
but I just couldn’t.

00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:56.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt ashamed because I knew inside

00:25:56.404 --> 00:25:59.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah wasn’t happy
with what I was doing.

00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience really bothered me.

00:26:06.548 --> 00:26:08.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a moment when my boyfriend

00:26:08.883 --> 00:26:11.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then some of those friends
really let me down.

00:26:11.753 --> 00:26:16.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began thinking about how I
didn’t have anyone else in my life.

00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:19.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
One time, we were all drinking,

00:26:19.194 --> 00:26:22.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this girl invited us all
to go to her house.

00:26:22.097 --> 00:26:23.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started thinking

00:26:23.898 --> 00:26:27.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what might happen
if I said yes to that girl’s invitation.

00:26:28.903 --> 00:26:32.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that there’d be drinking, drugs,

00:26:32.474 --> 00:26:35.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe even something immoral
might happen.

00:26:35.777 --> 00:26:38.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after having not prayed
for a really long time,

00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:43.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
I closed my eyes and said:
“Jehovah, please help me.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just so alone.
I don’t have anyone.”

00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:53.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt completely abandoned by everyone.

00:26:53.628 --> 00:26:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So right then and there,
I said a prayer to Jehovah,

00:26:57.132 --> 00:27:00.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking him
that if he would help me to say no,

00:27:00.168 --> 00:27:03.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
from that day forward,
I would stop associating with those friends

00:27:03.305 --> 00:27:05.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve him whole-souled.

00:27:05.307 --> 00:27:08.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times,
I asked Jehovah to forgive me.

00:27:08.076 --> 00:27:10.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said:
“Jehovah, you’re the only one I have.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please help me.”

00:27:13.448 --> 00:27:14.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what happened.

00:27:14.916 --> 00:27:18.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
After saying that prayer,
I felt determined to leave.

00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:21.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started thinking
about everything that I’d done

00:27:21.956 --> 00:27:24.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how I was putting
not only my own life at risk

00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:27.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also my relationship with Jehovah.

00:27:27.762 --> 00:27:30.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘I’m going to talk to the elders.’

00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:33.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I’m a very shy person,

00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:36.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
the thought of confessing my mistakes
was really difficult.

00:27:36.171 --> 00:27:39.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
I talked to them,
and I told them everything that had happened.

00:27:39.974 --> 00:27:42.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a weight had been lifted off me.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:46.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw that I really wasn’t alone after all.

00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:48.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still remember a scripture
that they read to me

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 86:5,

00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:53.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
which showed me that Jehovah’s forgiveness

00:27:53.288 --> 00:27:55.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
has no limits if I’m truly repentant.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I knew that Jehovah would forgive me.

00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:01.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the elders also told me
that I’d have to tell my parents,

00:28:01.763 --> 00:28:03.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was very difficult.

00:28:03.998 --> 00:28:07.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought, ‘Well, I need to speak up.’

00:28:07.168 --> 00:28:11.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just opened up
and told them about what had happened.

00:28:15.343 --> 00:28:17.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided
that I was going talk with an elder,

00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:21.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he read a scripture with me
from Philippians 4:7,

00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:23.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says that “the peace of God

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:25.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that surpasses all understanding

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
will guard [our] hearts.”

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:32.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was able to pray again,
knowing that if I really changed,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could feel that peace
that comes from Jehovah.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started studying the Bible for real.

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:42.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stopped associating with those friends

00:28:42.003 --> 00:28:45.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started being more involved
in spiritual things.

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:48.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege of getting baptized
and becoming a regular pioneer.

00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:50.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today, I’m serving at Bethel.

00:28:50.945 --> 00:28:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the privilege of being invited
to help with construction projects,

00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:56.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my greatest privilege

00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:59.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the strong friendship
that I have with Jehovah

00:28:59.621 --> 00:29:02.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also having true friends.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen that Jehovah
has always been by my side.

00:29:06.461 --> 00:29:08.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even when I didn’t want to be with him,

00:29:08.763 --> 00:29:10.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:29:30.418 --> 00:29:33.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it encouraging
to see how Jehovah gives us

00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:37.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
just what we need
to get back up if we stumble?

00:29:38.793 --> 00:29:42.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Father
is indeed “ready to forgive.”

00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our music video this month reminds us

00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s loving concern
for those who suffer a spiritual fall.

00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:11.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the whole of humankind,
Be sure you’ll never find

00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:17.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone who can say,
“I’ve never stumbled in my life.”

00:30:17.732 --> 00:30:24.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now this time it’s you,
But there’s something you can do:

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:33.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Learn from the experience,
And take the help our loving God provides.

00:30:33.014 --> 00:30:39.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get back up when you’re down.
You can turn this around.

00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:45.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get back up; stand up tall.
You can learn from a fall.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just reach out;
take his hand.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll raise you up—
make you stand.

00:30:52.667 --> 00:31:00.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one thing that’s for sure:
You’ll be stronger than before

00:31:00.742 --> 00:31:05.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you learn from a fall.

00:31:15.757 --> 00:31:21.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another dawn is breaking,
And your heart may be aching.

00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:28.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you can’t go back in time.
You have to see it through.

00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:34.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stop and think it over,
And take it to Jehovah.

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:43.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
His Word is there to guide you,
To pick you up and show you what to do.

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:50.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get back up when you’re down.
You can turn this around.

00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:56.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get back up; stand up tall.
You can learn from a fall.

00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:59.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just reach out;
take his hand.

00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:03.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll raise you up—
make you stand.

00:32:03.404 --> 00:32:11.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one thing that’s for sure:
You’ll be stronger than before.

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:17.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let Jehovah’s Word remind you
You can put it all behind you.

00:32:17.552 --> 00:32:23.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
His love “is greater than our hearts,”
You may recall.

00:32:23.324 --> 00:32:27.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Learn from a fall.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:33:02.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get back up when you’re down.
You can turn this around.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:08.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get back up; stand up tall.
You can learn from a fall.

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:11.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just reach out;
take his hand.

00:33:11.773 --> 00:33:15.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll raise you up—
make you stand.

00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:23.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one thing that’s for sure:
You’ll be stronger than before

00:33:23.284 --> 00:33:29.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you learn from a fall.

00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:42.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can learn from a fall.

00:33:45.306 --> 00:33:48.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
That music video beautifully illustrates

00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:50.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
a point from our discussion:

00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:53.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can recover from a fall.

00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:58.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah,
that’s always a reasonable expectation.

00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:01.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 20 years ago, 

00:34:01.522 --> 00:34:04.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Awake!</i>  magazine published
the life story

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:07.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Alena Žitníková.

00:34:07.228 --> 00:34:10.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alena realized that pleasing Jehovah

00:34:10.231 --> 00:34:13.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
would mean rejection by this world.

00:34:13.534 --> 00:34:17.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the following episode
of <i>Where Are They Now?</i>

00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:21.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
note what she describes
as perhaps an even bigger test.

00:34:24.345 --> 00:34:26.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Alena Žitníková,

00:34:26.614 --> 00:34:28.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was born into a family

00:34:28.883 --> 00:34:30.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a zealous Communist.

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:34.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
We believed that a world was coming

00:34:34.055 --> 00:34:37.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
where people would have
everything they needed.

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:41.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d be happy,
and there would be peace worldwide,

00:34:41.529 --> 00:34:43.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I deeply believed it.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I found paradise
among God’s people.

00:34:56.978 --> 00:35:01.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I grew up,
I realized that Communism

00:35:01.149 --> 00:35:05.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
had its deficits
because I saw its hypocrisy.

00:35:07.321 --> 00:35:10.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
People didn’t practice
what they preached.

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:14.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
In high school, I met a friend

00:35:14.395 --> 00:35:17.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
who started talking about God and the Bible.

00:35:18.633 --> 00:35:23.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the fact that God’s name is Jehovah

00:35:24.572 --> 00:35:27.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that something
called God’s Kingdom

00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:30.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Armageddon will come

00:35:30.344 --> 00:35:33.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those were all new concepts for me.

00:35:35.082 --> 00:35:37.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d never heard of these things before.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:41.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d never even held a Bible in my hand.

00:35:43.624 --> 00:35:46.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Bible study
gradually helped me gain faith.

00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:53.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1983, I was baptized in a bathtub.

00:35:53.301 --> 00:35:57.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, Jehovah’s Witnesses
were under ban.

00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:00.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1989,

00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:02.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Velvet Revolution took place

00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:04.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Czechoslovakia.

00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:08.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
That also meant a change
for Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:36:10.017 --> 00:36:13.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we could begin
to express our faith publicly.

00:36:15.823 --> 00:36:17.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
The house-to-house ministry started,

00:36:17.859 --> 00:36:20.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was something
amazing and new for me.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got to know Petr
in our local congregation,

00:36:26.534 --> 00:36:29.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we got married in 1990.

00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:33.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We entered into full-time service

00:36:33.107 --> 00:36:35.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
two years after the wedding.

00:36:35.576 --> 00:36:39.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
We first started serving as regular pioneers,

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two years later

00:36:40.514 --> 00:36:43.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were invited to Bethel.

00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:47.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were years full of joy

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:49.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full of hard work,

00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:51.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
which greatly enriched me.

00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:56.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
We left Bethel eight years later,

00:36:56.831 --> 00:36:59.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I found that people had changed.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was a challenge for us

00:37:05.406 --> 00:37:09.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
because now people
had become more materialistic.

00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:13.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I learned the truth,

00:37:13.614 --> 00:37:16.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seemed to me
that Armageddon was at the door

00:37:16.284 --> 00:37:18.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that it would come soon.

00:37:18.853 --> 00:37:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the world helped us in a way

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:23.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it didn’t want us;

00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:26.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
it didn’t want Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:30.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
But today’s world, with its freedom,

00:37:30.064 --> 00:37:33.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t tell us that it doesn’t want us.

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:36.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it wants us.

00:37:36.237 --> 00:37:41.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wants our time, it wants our attention,

00:37:41.042 --> 00:37:44.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore
there may be a great danger.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could feel
that Armageddon is delaying.

00:37:49.984 --> 00:37:54.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we might feel the need
to fulfill our dreams already today.

00:37:54.255 --> 00:37:59.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah teaches me to be patient.

00:37:59.293 --> 00:38:02.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is a happy God,

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:07.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even when he waits,
he does not wait idly.

00:38:07.068 --> 00:38:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is hardworking;
he’s always doing something.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you fill the waiting
with activity, time goes faster.

00:38:18.779 --> 00:38:22.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
The field ministry is very important to me.

00:38:22.783 --> 00:38:25.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it costs a little effort,

00:38:25.653 --> 00:38:30.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my service partners are always
a great encouragement to me.

00:38:30.191 --> 00:38:32.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:34.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have nice conversations in service.

00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:37.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even today, we find people

00:38:37.598 --> 00:38:40.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
who think about the meaning of life.

00:38:41.836 --> 00:38:46.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Service does not only consist
of house-to-house service;

00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:50.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
service is the whole Christian way of life,

00:38:50.611 --> 00:38:54.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
including caring for brothers and sisters.

00:38:54.348 --> 00:38:58.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think serving my brothers and sisters

00:38:58.019 --> 00:39:01.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires us to set aside time for them.

00:39:03.024 --> 00:39:07.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, I can promote
a good atmosphere in the congregation.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:13.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be in a spiritual paradise,
I must contribute something.

00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:18.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, the spiritual paradise

00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be bigger, deeper, and more beautiful!

00:39:23.744 --> 00:39:26.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do something for others,

00:39:26.881 --> 00:39:30.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t think too much
about ourselves—our pain.

00:39:32.887 --> 00:39:37.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think life in Jehovah’s service

00:39:37.925 --> 00:39:40.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
is sometimes challenging,

00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:46.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the result is happiness.

00:39:48.002 --> 00:39:50.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
And already today,

00:39:50.538 --> 00:39:55.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that my dream of a happy life

00:39:55.276 --> 00:39:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
has come true.

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:15.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re encouraged to see
Sister Alena Žitníková and her husband, Petr,

00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
remain busy in Kingdom service.

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:20.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful that this has helped them

00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:23.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have realistic expectations

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:26.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to remain joyful!

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a world that wants our time and energy,

00:40:30.945 --> 00:40:35.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alena maintains her focus
by sharing her Christian hope,

00:40:35.316 --> 00:40:37.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for her brothers and sisters,

00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and doing her all to encourage others.

00:40:41.956 --> 00:40:44.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you want to encourage others

00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:47.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you don’t know what to say?

00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:51.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the lessons we learn
from the apostle Paul’s example

00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:54.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this morning worship
presented by Brother David Schafer.

00:40:55.636 --> 00:40:56.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
“If you have

00:40:56.637 --> 00:40:59.773 line:10% position:50% align:center
“any word of encouragement . . . ,

00:40:59.773 --> 00:41:01.142 line:10% position:50% align:center
tell it.”

00:41:01.142 --> 00:41:03.344 line:10% position:50% align:center
Who said those words?

00:41:03.344 --> 00:41:06.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
How or what did the apostle Paul

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.115 line:10% position:50% align:center
say in response?

00:41:08.115 --> 00:41:10.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
How did his audience react?

00:41:10.284 --> 00:41:14.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can Paul’s example teach us
about encouragement?

00:41:14.955 --> 00:41:17.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Acts chapter 13.

00:41:17.424 --> 00:41:20.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the account
of Paul’s first missionary tour.

00:41:20.494 --> 00:41:23.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a dangerous journey
of about 110 miles (180 km),

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:26.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul and his companions
find themselves seated

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a synagogue in Pisidian Antioch.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 15 says:

00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:35.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After the public reading
of the Law and the Prophets,

00:41:35.176 --> 00:41:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the presiding officers of the synagogue
sent word to them, saying:

00:41:38.846 --> 00:41:42.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Men, brothers, if you have
any word of encouragement for the people,

00:41:42.716 --> 00:41:44.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell it.’”

00:41:44.652 --> 00:41:48.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the next five paragraphs
contain Paul’s speech.

00:41:48.889 --> 00:41:50.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
How effective was it?

00:41:50.891 --> 00:41:55.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 42-44 show the results.

00:41:55.062 --> 00:42:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the people begged Paul to come back
and give another talk the next weekend.

00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:04.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, many Jews and proselytes
became believers.

00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:06.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, on the following Sabbath,

00:42:06.574 --> 00:42:10.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly all of the city turned out
to hear Paul’s next talk.

00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:11.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:14.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to ask ourselves,

00:42:14.548 --> 00:42:17.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What did Paul say in those five paragraphs

00:42:17.251 --> 00:42:20.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was so persuasive?’

00:42:20.354 --> 00:42:23.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the first things we note
is his introduction

00:42:23.157 --> 00:42:25.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 13:17:

00:42:25.993 --> 00:42:28.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The God of this people Israel chose

00:42:28.862 --> 00:42:31.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
our forefathers.”

00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:34.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, note that inclusive pronoun “our”

00:42:34.735 --> 00:42:38.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not your forefathers, not mine—
“our forefathers.”

00:42:38.305 --> 00:42:41.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you realize that the last time
that little word was used in the book of Acts

00:42:41.675 --> 00:42:45.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
was all the way back in chapter 7

00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:48.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
during Stephen’s powerful speech?

00:42:48.082 --> 00:42:51.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stephen used the word “our” ten times,

00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:54.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
usually in connection
with the word “forefathers.”

00:42:54.288 --> 00:42:57.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul heard that speech
back when he was Saul of Tarsus.

00:42:57.791 --> 00:43:02.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, more than a decade later,
he himself uses the exact same expression

00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:07.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the same purpose
—to establish common ground.

00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:10.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Your ancestors are my ancestors.

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:12.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am what you are.’

00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:16.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is the starting point
of true encouragement.

00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:19.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Watchtower</i>  article
from which our text is taken

00:43:19.046 --> 00:43:23.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that “the Greek word
usually translated ‘encouragement’

00:43:23.517 --> 00:43:27.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally means ‘a calling to one’s side.’”

00:43:27.588 --> 00:43:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, yes, it’s related
to the Greek word for “comfort,”

00:43:30.257 --> 00:43:32.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has a similar connotation.

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:36.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul began from their perspective:

00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:38.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I know where you’re coming from.

00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:41.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up
learning the same holy writings as you.’

00:43:41.635 --> 00:43:44.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verses 17-31,

00:43:44.104 --> 00:43:46.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
he uses Jewish history and recent events

00:43:46.974 --> 00:43:49.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prove that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in verses 32-37, he connects

00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:57.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
current events with fulfilled prophecy

00:43:57.251 --> 00:43:59.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
—prophecy that they knew.

00:43:59.386 --> 00:44:01.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do that today, don’t we?

00:44:01.522 --> 00:44:05.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
We go to the door; we read Matthew 24:7;
we ask: “What do you think?

00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are the wars, famines, and earthquakes

00:44:07.795 --> 00:44:10.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we’ve seen in recent years
the same as ever

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
or are they a distinct fulfillment
of Bible prophecy?”

00:44:12.666 --> 00:44:15.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the message?

00:44:15.135 --> 00:44:19.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Jehovah is real; that Jehovah is alive;

00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:21.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
his Word is coming true.

00:44:21.208 --> 00:44:24.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, Paul went further, didn’t he?
He didn’t stop there.

00:44:24.845 --> 00:44:27.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 33, Paul said:

00:44:27.014 --> 00:44:30.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God has completely fulfilled it

00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:32.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
to us.”

00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:34.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, this is personal.

00:44:34.421 --> 00:44:37.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is at work in your life—in my life.

00:44:37.524 --> 00:44:40.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the big conclusion in verses 38-41.

00:44:40.961 --> 00:44:44.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, Jehovah did this for you;

00:44:44.331 --> 00:44:47.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t miss out; you can succeed
with Jehovah’s help.

00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:50.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was Paul’s answer to a simple request

00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:54.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a “word of encouragement.”

00:44:54.007 --> 00:44:56.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Paul made disciples.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that how we’re counseled to fulfill

00:44:58.912 --> 00:45:01.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
our student assignments today?

00:45:01.048 --> 00:45:03.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen and encourage our audience,

00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:08.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should show what Jehovah has done,

00:45:08.088 --> 00:45:11.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he is doing, and what he will yet do.

00:45:11.825 --> 00:45:16.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Paul’s speech was so persuasive
that it also drew persecution,

00:45:16.563 --> 00:45:19.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
which followed him to the next two cities.

00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:23.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Lystra, his persecutors thought
they had killed him.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Acts 14:20, 21 says

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “on the next day

00:45:30.377 --> 00:45:33.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he left with Barnabas for Derbe.

00:45:33.213 --> 00:45:37.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
After declaring the good news to that city
and making quite a few disciples,”

00:45:38.285 --> 00:45:40.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
they faced a choice.

00:45:40.287 --> 00:45:44.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see the choice on Map B13.

00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:46.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re looking at the red lines

00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:49.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating Paul’s first missionary tour.

00:45:49.263 --> 00:45:53.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Derbe is the last stop,
but notice the next town over to the east

00:45:53.534 --> 00:45:55.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Tarsus.

00:45:55.135 --> 00:45:56.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sound familiar?

00:45:56.537 --> 00:45:59.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul of Tarsus.

00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:01.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a passageway from Derbe to Tarsus.

00:46:01.642 --> 00:46:03.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul would have known the road.

00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:05.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used it on his second missionary journey

00:46:05.312 --> 00:46:08.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his third missionary journey,
but not this time.

00:46:08.982 --> 00:46:12.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 14:21
—and the red arrows show that Paul returned

00:46:12.986 --> 00:46:15.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all three cities
where he had been persecuted,

00:46:15.756 --> 00:46:18.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Pisidian Antioch,

00:46:18.892 --> 00:46:23.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he first received the request
for a “word of encouragement.”

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? Why return?

00:46:25.232 --> 00:46:28.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would have been so easy for him to think:
‘You know, we’ve had a pretty good run here.

00:46:28.502 --> 00:46:30.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I helped the ruler of Cyprus into the truth.

00:46:30.604 --> 00:46:33.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I performed my first miracle,
striking Elymas blind.

00:46:33.607 --> 00:46:38.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We started new congregations
in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe.

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:40.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I endured all manner of hardships.

00:46:40.447 --> 00:46:43.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I was beaten up and stoned
and left for dead.

00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:46.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a successful missionary tour,
but I need to regroup.’

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. He didn’t think that way.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:46:51.358 --> 00:46:54.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the needs of the congregation

00:46:54.127 --> 00:46:58.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
outweighed his own personal feelings

00:46:58.298 --> 00:46:59.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fears.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you suppose that the opposers
who stoned him and left him for dead

00:47:04.872 --> 00:47:09.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
were any kinder
to the new disciples in Lystra?

00:47:09.843 --> 00:47:12.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides, who was taking the lead?

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:14.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul needed to appoint overseers.

00:47:14.314 --> 00:47:16.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a weighty task.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
So back they went.

00:47:19.319 --> 00:47:23.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise today, our brothers
are putting the needs of the disciples

00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:26.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of their own comforts.

00:47:26.293 --> 00:47:27.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember these scenes

00:47:27.694 --> 00:47:32.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
from <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses—Faith in Action,</i>
<i>Part 2: Let the Light Shine?</i>

00:47:32.165 --> 00:47:35.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Pillars explains
that when he refused

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:37.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
to salute the flag in Winnsboro, Texas,

00:47:37.905 --> 00:47:40.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was beaten up and hanged.

00:47:40.574 --> 00:47:45.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, the rope broke,
and he survived to tell the story.

00:47:46.146 --> 00:47:49.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
What the video doesn’t tell us
is that Oscar Pillars was a circuit overseer.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:53.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some months later,
guess where it was time for him to return?

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Winnsboro, Texas.

00:47:55.622 --> 00:47:58.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the months
since the hanging incident,

00:47:58.258 --> 00:48:02.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers hadn’t been preaching downtown
—they were preaching in the rurals.

00:48:02.162 --> 00:48:05.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Pillars reasoned
that if he didn’t preach downtown,

00:48:05.632 --> 00:48:09.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers may never get the courage
to preach there.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he checked out all the territories
within the city limits.

00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:17.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
They worked there all morning and had
a beautiful time with no negative incidents,

00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:20.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
except at the very last door.

00:48:20.247 --> 00:48:23.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman said, “Say,

00:48:23.684 --> 00:48:25.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
aren’t you?”

00:48:25.852 --> 00:48:27.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “Yes, ma’am, I am.”

00:48:27.921 --> 00:48:31.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “You know,
we hanged one of you people here,

00:48:31.592 --> 00:48:33.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll do it again.”

00:48:33.694 --> 00:48:37.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he didn’t tell her
that he was the one that they hanged.

00:48:37.698 --> 00:48:42.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a beautiful example
of standing with your brothers

00:48:42.402 --> 00:48:44.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and putting their needs

00:48:44.504 --> 00:48:48.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of your own feelings!

00:48:48.008 --> 00:48:50.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have to say that this Bethel family

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:52.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not self-sparing

00:48:52.479 --> 00:48:55.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
when encouragement is needed.

00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:57.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, though, it could be easy to think,

00:48:57.184 --> 00:49:00.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, I just don’t know what to say.’

00:49:00.621 --> 00:49:05.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is saying something always necessary?

00:49:05.425 --> 00:49:08.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you suppose those in Lystra felt

00:49:08.729 --> 00:49:11.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to see Paul again,

00:49:11.298 --> 00:49:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing what it must have taken
for him emotionally

00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:16.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply to return?

00:49:16.803 --> 00:49:20.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
That of itself spoke volumes.

00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:24.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘OK, but I still feel
like I should say something.’

00:49:24.277 --> 00:49:25.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul say?

00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:29.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 22: “We must enter
into the Kingdom of God

00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:32.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
through many tribulations.”

00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:35.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom—words of true encouragement

00:49:35.689 --> 00:49:38.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
always center on the Kingdom.

00:49:38.425 --> 00:49:39.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not like Job’s false comforters:

00:49:39.893 --> 00:49:42.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Clearly, you have problems here.
You must be doing something wrong.’

00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:45.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, rather: ‘You’re imitating Jesus.

00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:48.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It brought the wrath of our enemy.
Well done!

00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:53.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And that you’re willing to suffer
proves that this is real.

00:49:53.206 --> 00:49:55.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You will see Jehovah back you up now.

00:49:55.642 --> 00:49:57.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You will see him reward you in the future.

00:49:57.978 --> 00:50:00.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stick with it!’

00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:03.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you been called on to offer

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “word of encouragement”?

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t over think it, just go!

00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:14.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stand beside those who need you.

00:50:14.761 --> 00:50:16.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you have

00:50:16.196 --> 00:50:20.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
any words of encouragement for the people,
“tell it.”

00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:24.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it faith-strengthening to consider

00:50:24.404 --> 00:50:27.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
both first-century and modern-day examples

00:50:27.841 --> 00:50:31.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
of brothers who poured themselves out
to encourage others,

00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:34.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the face of grave danger?

00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:39.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has a health condition caused you to pause

00:50:39.519 --> 00:50:43.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reevaluate your goals and expectations?

00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:46.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please consider the following interview

00:50:46.026 --> 00:50:49.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was presented
to the United States Bethel family.

00:50:50.163 --> 00:50:51.765 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we have many fine examples

00:50:51.765 --> 00:50:54.034 line:10% position:50% align:center
of those who have maintained their focus

00:50:54.034 --> 00:50:57.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
during extreme life events.

00:50:57.237 --> 00:51:01.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the experience
of Felix and Mayra Terrazas

00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:04.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the following prerecorded interview.

00:51:05.946 --> 00:51:08.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a privilege
to be with Felix and Mayra Terrazas,

00:51:08.615 --> 00:51:10.117 line:10% position:50% align:center
serving at Wallkill.

00:51:10.117 --> 00:51:11.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
We understand

00:51:11.284 --> 00:51:13.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s been a very difficult year.

00:51:13.553 --> 00:51:17.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you share some of the details
of your medical condition?

00:51:17.858 --> 00:51:19.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, about a year and a half ago,

00:51:19.259 --> 00:51:20.627 line:10% position:50% align:center
I started developing

00:51:20.627 --> 00:51:23.163 line:10% position:50% align:center
an infrequent pain in my chest,

00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:25.532 line:10% position:50% align:center
which led me to seeing several doctors.

00:51:26.299 --> 00:51:27.768 line:10% position:50% align:center
Soon thereafter,

00:51:27.768 --> 00:51:31.037 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was diagnosed with a malignant tumor

00:51:31.037 --> 00:51:35.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was only going to be treatable
by its complete removal.

00:51:35.308 --> 00:51:39.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the surgery, we were hoping 
to hear good news moving forward.

00:51:39.813 --> 00:51:42.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, a few weeks later,

00:51:42.382 --> 00:51:46.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of my doctors conveyed
to us some of the most difficult words

00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:48.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one could imagine hearing

00:51:48.388 --> 00:51:51.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a life expectancy of just a few months.

00:51:52.592 --> 00:51:55.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!
That had to have been difficult to hear.

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
How were you able to get your mind
wrapped around that?

00:51:58.565 --> 00:52:03.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you can imagine, 
after many intense and tearful prayers

00:52:03.436 --> 00:52:06.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking Jehovah to give us peace of mind

00:52:06.173 --> 00:52:11.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to give us a calm heart and wisdom
to make a good decision,

00:52:11.178 --> 00:52:15.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided on a treatment of hospice care

00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:19.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow me
to make the most of the time that I had left

00:52:19.085 --> 00:52:23.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be able to give
my very best to Jehovah.

00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s remarkable, Felix.

00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:29.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Mayra, you’re such a supportive wife.

00:52:29.095 --> 00:52:31.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have you been able to be so positive?

00:52:31.998 --> 00:52:35.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have to say that it is my hope in Jehovah.

00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:37.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is what has helped me.

00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:39.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the moment,
we are ‘sharing in the sufferings’

00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:41.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at 2 Corinthians 1:7.

00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:46.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the verse concludes 
that ‘we will also share in the comfort,’

00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:49.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are also experiencing that right now.

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:53.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that I’ll see Felix again
in the resurrection.

00:52:53.854 --> 00:52:55.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I look to the future,

00:52:55.288 --> 00:52:58.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can vividly picture
us walking through the Paradise earth,

00:52:58.892 --> 00:53:01.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoying Jehovah’s beautiful creation.

00:53:01.795 --> 00:53:05.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the life, “the real life,” 
that Jehovah promises.

00:53:05.565 --> 00:53:09.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s this hope
that gives me joy and peace.

00:53:10.036 --> 00:53:11.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautifully expressed.

00:53:11.171 --> 00:53:12.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:53:12.172 --> 00:53:15.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Felix, how have you
been able to be so joyful?

00:53:16.843 --> 00:53:21.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relationship with Jehovah
has never been stronger than it is right now.

00:53:21.848 --> 00:53:26.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I believe that it’s this closeness
and this intimacy with him

00:53:26.586 --> 00:53:30.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is providing me
the joy that I’m experiencing.

00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:33.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Philippians 4:6, 7

00:53:33.426 --> 00:53:37.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
assures me that “by prayer
and [by] supplication,”

00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:41.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that “the peace of God . . .
will guard your hearts.”

00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:44.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer has been so indispensable

00:53:44.104 --> 00:53:46.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
in bringing me peace during this process,

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s also amplified my appreciation
for the resurrection

00:53:50.577 --> 00:53:53.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I’ve never experienced before.

00:53:53.713 --> 00:53:56.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 12:25, I think,

00:53:56.016 --> 00:53:59.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
perfectly illustrates our current situation.

00:53:59.686 --> 00:54:04.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says:
“Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,

00:54:04.691 --> 00:54:08.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a good word
[it says that it] cheers it up.”

00:54:09.262 --> 00:54:12.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both Mayra and I have benefited

00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:15.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what we feel is an enormous storehouse

00:54:15.969 --> 00:54:19.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
of good words received in the way of concern,

00:54:19.539 --> 00:54:22.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
of love and compassion, from the brotherhood.

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:26.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last, my current circumstances

00:54:26.012 --> 00:54:29.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
have opened up such a wonderful opportunity

00:54:29.316 --> 00:54:32.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share Kingdom truths with family members,

00:54:32.118 --> 00:54:36.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the beautiful privilege
of being able to study the Bible

00:54:36.456 --> 00:54:39.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my mother during the past few months.

00:54:39.726 --> 00:54:41.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! Amazing!

00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:44.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell us, how has this experience

00:54:44.064 --> 00:54:46.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected your faith and trust in Jehovah?

00:54:47.567 --> 00:54:50.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have seen Jehovah’s hand
from the very beginning,

00:54:50.403 --> 00:54:53.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
but one time sticks out in my mind.

00:54:53.273 --> 00:54:56.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the day we received Felix’s prognosis.

00:54:56.977 --> 00:54:59.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
That evening,
the Bethel family <i>Watchtower</i>  Study

00:54:59.679 --> 00:55:03.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
considered the article
“Keep Calm and Trust in Jehovah,”

00:55:03.984 --> 00:55:06.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this was followed by a lecture

00:55:06.286 --> 00:55:10.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Remain
in Jehovah’s Everlasting Arms.”

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:14.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided us
exactly what we needed to hear

00:55:14.361 --> 00:55:16.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
that very day.

00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:19.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt it was an answer to our prayers,

00:55:19.632 --> 00:55:23.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if to reassure us
that he has everything under control.

00:55:23.803 --> 00:55:26.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has strengthened my faith
in that Jehovah will continue

00:55:26.539 --> 00:55:31.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “more than superabundantly”
provide for us care and guidance

00:55:31.177 --> 00:55:33.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we face new challenges

00:55:33.513 --> 00:55:37.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will without a doubt
fulfill his promises for the future.

00:55:39.219 --> 00:55:43.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think when you come to understand
that you only have a short time to live,

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:48.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, that’s something that can
very easily knock you right off of your feet.

00:55:48.862 --> 00:55:51.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know that we have been grasped

00:55:51.965 --> 00:55:54.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Jehovah’s caring hands right now,

00:55:54.501 --> 00:55:58.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is what’s stabilized us.

00:55:58.505 --> 00:56:02.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, throughout this ordeal,
we have seen Jehovah’s love

00:56:02.042 --> 00:56:04.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his care and assistance—

00:56:04.044 --> 00:56:07.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
in every decision, in every step,
that we’ve taken.

00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:11.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the first visits to the doctors,
through surgery,

00:56:11.651 --> 00:56:14.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and into the most difficult part
of the prognosis,

00:56:14.487 --> 00:56:17.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have lacked nothing.

00:56:17.157 --> 00:56:20.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
I absolutely know that my faith

00:56:20.326 --> 00:56:24.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
has only been strengthened
by the challenges of this trial.

00:56:25.398 --> 00:56:28.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now as I prepare to close my eyes

00:56:28.535 --> 00:56:32.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fall asleep for just a brief time,

00:56:32.038 --> 00:56:35.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a privilege for me
to demonstrate to Jehovah my trust

00:56:35.942 --> 00:56:38.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of his promises

00:56:38.278 --> 00:56:42.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to maintain complete integrity
right down to the end.

00:56:44.551 --> 00:56:46.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an outstanding expression of faith!

00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:48.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you both so much for sharing

00:56:48.855 --> 00:56:52.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
those deeply personal
and motivating expressions.

00:56:52.926 --> 00:56:55.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are a living example of faith in action,

00:56:56.763 --> 00:56:58.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love you.

00:56:59.365 --> 00:57:01.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t tell you
how many times I’ve seen that,

00:57:01.868 --> 00:57:03.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s so moving each time.

00:57:04.604 --> 00:57:06.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
On June 8, 2021,

00:57:06.873 --> 00:57:09.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
our dear brother Felix
went to sleep in death,

00:57:09.275 --> 00:57:12.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
just seven weeks after this interview. 

00:57:12.545 --> 00:57:16.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
And any, frankly, that were
around the Terrazas during this time

00:57:16.082 --> 00:57:18.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
would see firsthand

00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:20.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
the power of faith

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their focus on wanting to give
Jehovah their absolute best.

00:57:25.225 --> 00:57:26.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was tremendous!

00:57:26.726 --> 00:57:29.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mayra, dear Mayra, continues to show

00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:32.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
that same faith and endurance even now.

00:57:32.198 --> 00:57:33.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Felix’s mother

00:57:33.967 --> 00:57:37.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
—she has continued to progress spiritually,
we understand.

00:57:37.203 --> 00:57:39.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Felix will be so happy to hear that.

00:57:40.573 --> 00:57:42.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me personally,

00:57:42.575 --> 00:57:47.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s been heartwarming
to see Mayra’s unshakable faith

00:57:47.514 --> 00:57:51.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love and support
she receives from the Bethel family.

00:57:52.785 --> 00:57:57.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with Mayra,
we long to see Felix again.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:57:59.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in failing health,

00:57:59.759 --> 00:58:04.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
he used the strength he had
to build up those around him.

00:58:05.064 --> 00:58:07.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah truly appreciates shepherds

00:58:07.934 --> 00:58:10.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this same self-sacrificing spirit.

00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:16.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you once serve as a congregation elder?

00:58:16.476 --> 00:58:19.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you serve again?

00:58:19.112 --> 00:58:21.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the ways Jehovah assisted two brothers

00:58:21.648 --> 00:58:24.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome their feelings of disappointment

00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:28.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
and qualify again to serve their brothers.

00:58:29.889 --> 00:58:33.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
I served as an elder until the end of 2014.

00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:39.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when some problems came up,
and I ended up being disqualified.

00:58:42.402 --> 00:58:45.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already been serving as an elder
for nearly two years.

00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:47.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the time,

00:58:47.106 --> 00:58:49.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that the best thing to do

00:58:49.642 --> 00:58:53.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be to stop
and give up my privilege of service

00:58:53.112 --> 00:58:55.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I could care for myself emotionally.

00:58:58.885 --> 00:59:02.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I lost my privileges,
my qualifications were reviewed by the elders

00:59:02.155 --> 00:59:04.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
on three separate occasions,

00:59:06.659 --> 00:59:08.795 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that ended up dampening my desire

00:59:08.795 --> 00:59:10.797 line:10% position:50% align:center
to want to serve again in the future.

00:59:11.598 --> 00:59:12.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began thinking:

00:59:12.932 --> 00:59:15.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A publisher receives
the same reward as an elder.

00:59:15.602 --> 00:59:19.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why should I put myself
through that all over again?’

00:59:20.273 --> 00:59:22.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you resign or are disqualified

00:59:22.775 --> 00:59:24.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
from serving as an elder,

00:59:25.745 --> 00:59:27.146 line:10% position:50% align:center
you’re not immune

00:59:27.146 --> 00:59:30.116 line:10% position:50% align:center
to feeling like you’re a failure,

00:59:30.116 --> 00:59:31.851 line:10% position:50% align:center
feeling sad,

00:59:31.851 --> 00:59:36.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially feeling
that you’ve let Jehovah down.

00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:39.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a fight to remain active.

00:59:40.627 --> 00:59:45.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the biggest things that helped me
during that phase was my wife’s support.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
She believed in me and helped motivate me.

00:59:50.169 --> 00:59:52.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife was already a pioneer,

00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:54.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she encouraged me
to start pioneering too.

00:59:54.807 --> 00:59:56.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
So within just a few months,

00:59:56.843 --> 00:59:58.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already started serving as a pioneer.

00:59:59.912 --> 01:00:03.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was in the ministry
that I began to cultivate a desire

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:05.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve once again as an elder.

01:00:06.819 --> 01:00:10.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Getting involved
in activities with the congregation,

01:00:10.156 --> 01:00:12.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping out with the cleaning . . .

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being with my wife in the preaching work,

01:00:18.665 --> 01:00:20.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
conducting Bible studies . . .

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a lot of help from the brothers

01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:28.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cried with me when I needed to cry

01:00:29.575 --> 01:00:33.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who laughed with me
when it was possible to laugh.

01:00:33.346 --> 01:00:35.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
A mature elder helped me to see

01:00:35.581 --> 01:00:38.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I needed to leave the matter
in Jehovah’s hands.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:42.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
That time period
when I stopped serving as an elder,

01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:46.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that that may have been
when I prayed the most in all my life.

01:00:46.993 --> 01:00:49.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still wasn’t an elder, but I felt at peace.

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remembered 1 John 3:20,

01:00:52.432 --> 01:00:54.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “[Jehovah] is greater than our hearts”

01:00:54.867 --> 01:00:57.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he knew what I was going through.

01:00:59.005 --> 01:01:02.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just because
I wasn’t serving any longer as an elder,

01:01:02.308 --> 01:01:04.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
that didn’t make Jehovah love me any less.

01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:06.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me a lot.

01:01:07.447 --> 01:01:09.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most difficult thing to overcome

01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:12.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really the resentment
that I felt toward some brothers

01:01:12.318 --> 01:01:14.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had participated in the whole process.

01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:19.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture at Psalm 119:165

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:22.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to see that when you’re going
through a difficult situation,

01:01:22.528 --> 01:01:25.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s the time that you need to show
that you love Jehovah.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:30.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could see that during that time of my life,

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when I had to show
that I really loved Jehovah.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would pray to Jehovah each and every day,

01:01:37.643 --> 01:01:40.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would mention those brothers by name.

01:01:40.313 --> 01:01:42.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me to start softening my heart,

01:01:42.982 --> 01:01:45.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lessen and eventually
to eliminate this resentment.

01:01:48.254 --> 01:01:50.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting in Jehovah

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
was so worth it,

01:01:56.629 --> 01:02:00.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I felt like it was
a great act of love on his part

01:02:01.868 --> 01:02:05.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
to allow me once again to serve as an elder.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s as if he told me,

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:10.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Marcelo, I trust that you are going
to do a good job as an elder.’

01:02:11.611 --> 01:02:13.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just have to trust in Jehovah.

01:02:13.713 --> 01:02:15.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I began to show more trust,

01:02:15.948 --> 01:02:19.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when things started happening
in a way that I couldn’t have imagined.

01:02:19.552 --> 01:02:21.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
In less than two years,

01:02:21.354 --> 01:02:23.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already begun serving
as an elder again.

01:02:24.557 --> 01:02:27.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 2016, we received
an invitation to serve at Bethel.

01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:36.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife and I
have now been serving here at Bethel

01:02:36.302 --> 01:02:38.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a little more than ten years.

01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:41.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you accept the discipline,

01:02:41.974 --> 01:02:45.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you stop thinking about privileges

01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:48.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start thinking more about the brothers

01:02:48.114 --> 01:02:50.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about being more involved
in the ministry.

01:02:51.284 --> 01:02:54.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still had the most important privilege:

01:02:55.555 --> 01:02:58.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today we learned how important it is

01:03:04.464 --> 01:03:08.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have
realistic and reasonable expectations,

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
both of ourselves
and of our brothers and sisters.

01:03:12.572 --> 01:03:15.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of being discouraged
with what we cannot do,

01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:21.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
we rely on Jehovah
and set goals according to what we can do.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>My Teen Life</i>
and our music video reminded us

01:03:25.518 --> 01:03:27.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will give us the help we need

01:03:27.653 --> 01:03:31.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get back up
if we suffer a spiritual setback.

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in <i>Where Are They Now? </i>

01:03:34.794 --> 01:03:37.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
we caught up with Sister Alena Žitníková,

01:03:37.697 --> 01:03:40.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
who reminded us
that serving our brothers and sisters

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:44.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
can keep us focused and joyful.

01:03:46.105 --> 01:03:49.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
We end this month’s program
with our video postcard

01:03:49.008 --> 01:03:52.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our brothers and sisters in Costa Rica.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Costa Rica is a sparkling gem

01:03:55.214 --> 01:03:57.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sits on the so-called Ring of Fire,

01:03:57.717 --> 01:04:00.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
a chain approximately 40,000 kilometers,

01:04:00.686 --> 01:04:02.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 25,000 miles, long

01:04:02.822 --> 01:04:07.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
that contains about three quarters
of the earth’s volcanoes.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Costa Rica has 61 volcanoes

01:04:10.196 --> 01:04:12.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and 6 active ones.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
The weather and mountainous countryside

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:18.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ideal for growing delicious coffee.

01:04:20.339 --> 01:04:24.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name Costa Rica
means “Rich Coast” in Spanish.

01:04:25.511 --> 01:04:30.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is just a small sampling
of the different animal species here.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some are found nowhere else on earth.

01:04:34.854 --> 01:04:38.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
