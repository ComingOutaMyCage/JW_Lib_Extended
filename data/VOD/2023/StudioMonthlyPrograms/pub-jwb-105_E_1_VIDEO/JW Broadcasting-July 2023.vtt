Hello, and thank you for joining us!

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we look forward to
in this month’s broadcast?

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll hear from two young people

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
who chose to live

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
by God’s moral standards

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when their resolve

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:20.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
was seriously challenged by temptation.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
A new music video

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
celebrates the ways

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s people demonstrate

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
their unity and express their love

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
for one another.

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll see how one brother learned

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a life centered on Jehovah

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the key to true happiness.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the program for July 2023.

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
The evening before he died,

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:16.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus Christ asked his Father in prayer

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
to watch over his disciples.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:24.730 line:10% position:50% align:center
His request is recorded at John 17:15-17.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read it with me.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:31.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “I do not request

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:33.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you take them out of the world,

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that you watch over them

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of the wicked one.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are no part of the world,

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as I am no part of the world.”

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ confidence in Jehovah

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:50.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the power of the truth

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be seen clearly
in what he asks of his Father in verse 17:

00:01:55.427 --> 00:02:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sanctify them by means of the truth;

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
your word is truth.”

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we accept the truth

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:09.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make a personal dedication to God,

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:11.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a general sense,

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:15.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are sanctified,
or set apart, from the world

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:19.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we no longer fit into its mold.

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
People view us differently

00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:24.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our values have changed.

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:28.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live by the standards of Bible truth,

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:32.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and doing so honors Jehovah God,

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives our life meaning,
and brings us great happiness.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
With those thoughts in mind,

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:43.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
how should we feel about the sayings of God

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:46.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible truths that we have learned?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel the way the psalmist did.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 119:140,

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said to Jehovah God:

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your saying is thoroughly refined

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[which means that it’s clean and pure;

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he said],
and your servant loves it.”

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that how we feel about the truth?

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love it!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be wonderful if everyone
would respond to the truth of God’s Word

00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love it.

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:25.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the sad fact is
that the majority of the world rejects it.

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:32.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many people
who do not believe that truth is attainable.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some ancient philosophers
made the teaching of doubts

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:39.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
virtually their life’s work.

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:44.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Human philosophy
is built on pride of intellect

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:48.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a warped pleasure of endless speculation

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
that leaves Jehovah God, the Creator,

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely out of the picture.

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
By removing God,

00:03:56.173 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
philosophers wander
in a maze of ideas and theories

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:05.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fascinate the mind and inflate the ego

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never arrive at the truth.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
If truth were not attainable,

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:14.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would Jesus Christ say

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at John 8:31, 32:

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you remain in my word,

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:24.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you are really my disciples,

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will know the truth,

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:30.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truth will set you free”?

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:34.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we not experiencing
the freedom that Jesus spoke of?

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why would the apostle Paul write
at 1 Timothy 2:4

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s “will is that all sorts of people

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be saved
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth”?

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does the word “truth” occur
over a hundred times

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:55.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Christian Greek Scriptures?

00:04:56.733 --> 00:05:01.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus not only pointed out
that the truth is attainable,

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:04.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he showed that finding it is required

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
if our worship is to be approved by God.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:10.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a Samaritan woman wondered

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:14.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the true form of worship was

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:17.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the worship practiced
by the Jews in Jerusalem

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:21.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that practiced
by the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim—

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not answer by saying:

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Truth is unattainable,
and you don’t need to worry about it,’

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ‘You can believe
whatever you want to believe.’

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:37.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jesus did not view the truth as relative

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:41.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that whatever you want to believe
is the truth.

00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:43.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is nonsense

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has nothing to do
with the realities of life.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 4:23, 24,

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:56.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus made a specific reference to truth,

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:59.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit, and pure worship.

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:03.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 4:23, 24, he said:

00:06:03.717 --> 00:06:06.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“True worshippers

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:09.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will worship the Father
with spirit and truth,

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:13.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for indeed, the Father is looking
for ones like these

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:15.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to worship him.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:23.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
must worship with spirit and truth.”

00:06:23.987 --> 00:06:27.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was talking about
being guided in our worship

00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
by God’s holy spirit

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:33.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said that we do not need
the use of temples, images,

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:37.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other physical objects in true worship.

00:06:37.918 --> 00:06:40.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the truth that Jesus referred to

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:44.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an accurate knowledge of Bible truths.

00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:49.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
True faith is much more
than just belief in God

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:51.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that he exists;

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:55.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
it also means an acceptance of God’s Word,

00:06:55.477 --> 00:06:59.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
obtaining an intellectual understanding
of that Word,

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:03.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then manifesting
a heartfelt reliance upon it.

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:06.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
As genuine Christians,

00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:11.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
we view the Bible
as the inspired Word of God,

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
beneficial for teaching
and disciplining mankind.

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:20.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 119:160 says of Jehovah God:

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:26.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The very essence of your word is truth.”

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus Christ stood before Pontius Pilate

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:33.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told him that he had come to earth
to speak the truth,

00:07:34.683 --> 00:07:39.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate responded with the words:
“What is truth?”

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:41.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely, Pilate was cynical.

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:46.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words reveal a skeptical view of truth.

00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:51.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the truth that Jesus had in mind
was about God’s Kingdom

00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:54.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus’ role as its King.

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:57.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the very theme, the core,

00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ teaching while he was on earth.

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why when Pilate asked Jesus
if he was a king,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus replied:

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:09.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You yourself say it.”

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, ‘Yes, I am,’

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:17.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he added that his Kingdom
was “no part of this world.”

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:22.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is that his Kingdom
will sanctify Jehovah’s name,

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:25.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
vindicate his sovereignty,

00:08:25.108 --> 00:08:30.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restore faithful mankind
to happy, eternal life.

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:35.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine Christians embrace this truth.

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:42.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jesus’ role in the fulfillment
of all of God’s promises is so pivotal 

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:44.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and since all of God’s prophecies

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:48.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
become “Amen,” or true, because of him,

00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:52.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus could well say,
as recorded at John 14:6:

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:58.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am the way and the truth and the life.”

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:01.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as 2 Corinthians 1:20 declares:

00:09:01.853 --> 00:09:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For no matter how many
the promises of God are,

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:09.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they have become ‘yes’ by means of him.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, also through him

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the ‘Amen’ said to God.”

00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:18.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used the word “amen”

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:21.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
to affirm the truthfulness of what was said,

00:09:21.873 --> 00:09:25.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he did so in a unique way.

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:29.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
We usually say “amen” after a prayer is said

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:31.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show our agreement with it.

00:09:31.883 --> 00:09:34.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, rather than use it

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reply to a prayer or a statement,

00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:39.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
he used “amen”

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:42.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
to introduce pronouncements of truth.

00:09:42.936 --> 00:09:44.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, he repeated the word,

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:49.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying “amen, amen”
and then made his statement,

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:51.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
which would be like saying

00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:55.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“most truly I say to you.”

00:09:55.157 --> 00:09:58.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, by using this expression,

00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:03.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
he assured his listeners
that his words were the absolute truth.

00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:06.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus could speak with such certainty

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was the one authorized

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:12.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make all of God’s promises come true.

00:10:14.217 --> 00:10:18.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
To us, the exhilarating
good news of God’s Kingdom

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:21.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the rulership of Jesus Christ

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:25.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more, far more, than mere information.

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:28.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
That truth moves us to action;

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:33.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
it compels us to live by it
and share it with others.

00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:37.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the first-century Christian congregation,

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:40.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way of life they adopted
as followers of Christ

00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:44.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
was sometimes known simply as “the truth”

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:48.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “the way of the truth.”

00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:52.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me 3 John verse 4, where it says:

00:10:52.422 --> 00:10:56.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No greater joy do I have than this:

00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:59.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should hear that my children

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:02.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
go on walking in the truth.”

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:06.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that how parents feel
about their children

00:11:06.394 --> 00:11:09.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are serving Jehovah faithfully?

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:11.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:14.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, not all young ones

00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:18.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
raised in a believing household
have stuck with the truth.

00:11:18.573 --> 00:11:23.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true about many
with whom we’ve studied the Bible.

00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:26.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is their situation hopeless?

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:28.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:31.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s still time for them to act

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:34.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to show Jehovah that they love him

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:37.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they love the truth.

00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
The end of this system is fast approaching.

00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:45.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is going to happen and soon.

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage such ones
to give serious thought

00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:52.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their relationship with Jehovah God,

00:11:52.232 --> 00:11:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he genuinely loves them

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:58.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wants them to have life.

00:11:58.405 --> 00:12:02.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray that such ones
take whatever steps are necessary

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:06.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
to return to Jehovah before it’s too late.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a Scriptural fact

00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:13.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people need to love the truth
in order to be saved.

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:17.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the point that the apostle Paul makes

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:19.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Thessalonians 2:10,

00:12:19.926 --> 00:12:23.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it reads in part
that people will perish

00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:28.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they did not accept
the love of the truth

00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order that they might be saved.”

00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:36.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our prayer is
that honesthearted people everywhere

00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:39.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
will respond to Jehovah’s invitation

00:12:39.237 --> 00:12:43.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
to draw close to him and love the truth.

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:47.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world is heading for an abrupt end

00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:50.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the battle of Armageddon.

00:12:50.582 --> 00:12:52.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
To survive that battle,

00:12:52.584 --> 00:12:55.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must have knowledge of Jehovah God

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:58.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
and live in harmony with his Word,

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:02.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
which includes the teachings of Jesus Christ.

00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:06.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earth wide we are proclaiming the good news

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s Kingdom
has been established in the heavens.

00:13:10.352 --> 00:13:12.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
That proclamation

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:16.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the foretold “witness to all the nations”

00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:20.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
that soon the accomplished end
of this world’s system will come.

00:13:20.945 --> 00:13:24.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, not the end of our planet,

00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:29.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
because another basic truth
is that “the earth remains forever”

00:13:29.412 --> 00:13:33.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
as stated at Ecclesiastes 1:4.

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:37.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are absolute truths that we preach,

00:13:37.962 --> 00:13:39.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we love them.

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:45.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing the truth sets us free from lies,

00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:48.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
delusions, and superstitions.

00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:50.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we live by it,

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:53.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
the truth strengthens us to endure hardships.

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:58.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s truth is so reliable and well-founded,

00:13:58.024 --> 00:14:01.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it so inspires us with hope

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:04.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it enables us
to stand up under any test.

00:14:05.657 --> 00:14:09.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see our brothers in lands
where they are mistreated and persecuted

00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:14.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing just that,
and they do it with joy.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
To dismiss truth as relative or nonexistent

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:23.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to miss out on the most thrilling

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:27.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fulfilling quest that life offers.

00:14:27.178 --> 00:14:31.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find the truth is to find hope;

00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:36.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know and love it is to know and love
the Creator of the universe

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his only-begotten Son;

00:14:38.898 --> 00:14:43.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live by it is to live with purpose
and peace of mind,

00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:46.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
now and forever.

00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:51.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no question

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when we live the truth,

00:14:53.455 --> 00:14:58.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
we stand out as different
from the world around us.

00:14:58.084 --> 00:15:00.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not easy for any of us.

00:15:00.795 --> 00:15:05.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you’re a teenager,
it’s especially hard.

00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:11.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones, we know your faith
is tested every day.

00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:14.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your peers question your belief in God,

00:15:14.768 --> 00:15:17.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
look down on Bible teachings,

00:15:17.353 --> 00:15:19.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make fun of your lifestyle.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
For your faith to remain strong,

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not enough
simply to believe what you’ve been taught.

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:32.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need solid reasons for what you believe.

00:15:32.118 --> 00:15:34.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we’re pleased to introduce

00:15:34.704 --> 00:15:38.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brand-new video series just for you

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:41.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
called <i>Reasons for Faith</i>.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each episode, young Witnesses like you

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk about why they have faith

00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they keep it strong in a world

00:15:51.513 --> 00:15:55.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has little or no respect for God’s Word.

00:16:04.108 --> 00:16:08.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was it difficult to uphold
God’s moral standards at school?

00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:12.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember that in high school
it was complicated

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:15.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my classmates made fun of me.

00:16:15.078 --> 00:16:19.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often said I acted holier-than-thou
and other similar insults

00:16:19.165 --> 00:16:22.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I didn’t go to nightclubs,
I didn’t curse, I didn’t smoke.

00:16:22.752 --> 00:16:25.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was unbearable because they
often tried to push me to the limit.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a one-hour bus ride
to get to high school,

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:32.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted the bus to make a U-turn
and avoid going to high school.

00:16:32.554 --> 00:16:34.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had all the time to think

00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:37.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what could happen to me
and what they could say to me,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I admit that I sometimes felt alone.

00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:44.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
The environment at school
often exposed me to immorality.

00:16:44.357 --> 00:16:46.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, girls would wear short skirts.

00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:48.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received instant messages

00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
from people I had never met before.

00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:52.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would send me photos,

00:16:52.866 --> 00:16:57.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
a phone number, or invitations
that I could have just simply accepted.

00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:00.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I could have easily committed
sexual immorality.

00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:05.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I felt like
I was missing out on something important

00:17:05.712 --> 00:17:08.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I heard my classmates
talking about what they were doing

00:17:08.381 --> 00:17:10.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their evenings and weekends

00:17:10.383 --> 00:17:13.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and about drinking alcohol
and new drugs they were trying

00:17:13.928 --> 00:17:15.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
or girls they had slept with.

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:19.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to become curious.

00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:25.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:17:28.484 --> 00:17:31.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
During family worship with my parents,

00:17:31.779 --> 00:17:33.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
we studied the example of Daniel.

00:17:33.489 --> 00:17:34.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Far from his family

00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:38.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
among people that didn’t serve Jehovah,

00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:40.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
he succeeded in remaining faithful,

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:42.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted to do the same.

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:44.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen my faith,

00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:46.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started reading the Bible.

00:17:46.002 --> 00:17:47.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to take the metro to get to school,

00:17:47.795 --> 00:17:51.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
so every morning I took the opportunity
to read a few verses. 

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:53.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought about the verses I had read.

00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:55.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
By praying to Jehovah,

00:17:55.553 --> 00:17:58.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
having a kind of
constant conversation with him,

00:17:58.806 --> 00:18:00.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would put me in a little bubble.

00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started feeling comfortable inside,

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was no longer
under the bad influence of others.

00:18:06.022 --> 00:18:10.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the fact that I prayed more
also made me feel closer to Jehovah.

00:18:10.944 --> 00:18:14.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a bit like Psalm 63:7,

00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
which describes how Jehovah shelters us
under his immense wings.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s exactly how I felt.

00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:22.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer allowed me to face any temptation.

00:18:29.462 --> 00:18:33.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you believe
that Jehovah’s standards are beneficial?

00:18:34.884 --> 00:18:37.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
I closely observed
the young ones in the world,

00:18:37.929 --> 00:18:42.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I realized that they are suffering
from the standards they follow.

00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:46.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
I closely stick to the moral standards
that Jehovah has given me.

00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:49.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m aware that they are there for my benefit,

00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:51.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
because with the experiences
I’ve had in school,

00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:54.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve observed the painful consequences
that my classmates have suffered.

00:18:55.947 --> 00:18:57.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some got into trouble with the law

00:18:57.615 --> 00:18:59.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
or got sick.

00:18:59.784 --> 00:19:02.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve had health problems
caused by their lifestyle.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
A girl in school
did something immoral with a boy,

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:10.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it started circulating around the school.

00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:11.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of that,

00:19:11.504 --> 00:19:13.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
the girl didn’t come to school anymore,

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:16.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she started having suicidal thoughts.

00:19:17.301 --> 00:19:21.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understood that Jehovah protects us
with his principles, his standards.

00:19:22.473 --> 00:19:25.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if I had compromised
even once with his standards,

00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:28.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would have regretted it sooner or later.

00:19:28.563 --> 00:19:31.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for me,
there is nothing worse than regret.

00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:34.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m 100 percent sure that Jehovah gave me

00:19:34.902 --> 00:19:37.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
these moral principles for my own good

00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:39.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I could be morally clean.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also helps me to be positive.

00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:44.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, he helped me
to see my classmates

00:19:44.537 --> 00:19:46.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
as potential disciples,

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:49.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were able to have conversations
about the Bible together.

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:52.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am really convinced
that Jehovah’s standards are good for me.

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:57.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
is the best life possible.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
What gave Clara and Hugo the courage

00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:15.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live by God’s standards
when under pressure that, as Clara said,

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:18.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘was sometimes unbearable’?

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:20.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
You heard them.

00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:23.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are absolutely convinced

00:20:23.242 --> 00:20:26.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s standards
are for their own good.

00:20:27.914 --> 00:20:30.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that how you feel?

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not follow their advice

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and dig deeply into God’s Word

00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:38.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen your confidence in it

00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pray to Jehovah for his help

00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:44.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you face those same pressures?

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:52.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Real faith has the power
to improve people’s lives

00:20:52.647 --> 00:20:55.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways they couldn’t have imagined

00:20:55.024 --> 00:20:57.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
before learning the truth.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take our brother Jason Worilds.

00:21:01.155 --> 00:21:04.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned that what the world offers

00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:09.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
pales in comparison
to what Jehovah freely gives us.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
News overnight

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.001 line:10% position:50% align:center
—Steelers’ linebacker Jason Worilds

00:21:14.001 --> 00:21:16.212 line:10% position:50% align:center
is walking away from the NFL

00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:18.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the prime of his NFL career.

00:21:18.256 --> 00:21:20.675 line:10% position:50% align:center
Worilds is or has been with the Steelers

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:23.511 line:10% position:50% align:center
for five seasons and started in all 16 games.

00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:26.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s just walking away
from tens of millions of dollars.

00:21:26.889 --> 00:21:28.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he going to do
for the rest of his life?

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:31.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
No clue, but it better be worth it.

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:33.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Jason Worilds,

00:21:33.604 --> 00:21:35.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:39.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom is a beautiful woman.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was in her early 20’s

00:21:41.362 --> 00:21:43.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she was introduced to the Witnesses,

00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:46.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she started a study,
and six months later

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:47.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was baptized.

00:21:47.618 --> 00:21:50.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mom put the truth before us growing up,

00:21:50.913 --> 00:21:52.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t see the true value
of what it was that I had.

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:55.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know how true the truth was.

00:21:56.919 --> 00:21:59.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s vital that you set spiritual goals.

00:22:00.047 --> 00:22:04.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t, the reality is
that someone is going to set a goal for you,

00:22:04.802 --> 00:22:07.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think that’s what was true in my case.

00:22:08.181 --> 00:22:10.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started playing American football

00:22:10.183 --> 00:22:11.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
my freshman year of high school.

00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:14.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of my coaches sat me down and said,

00:22:14.187 --> 00:22:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You can potentially go to college
on a full scholarship.”

00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:22.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did everything to succeed at football,

00:22:22.904 --> 00:22:26.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so the dedication—it escalates.

00:22:28.492 --> 00:22:30.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
I studied the Bible for several years,

00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:34.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by the time
that I started to make progress in my study,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was being courted by the NFL.

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:42.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was whole-souled to football.

00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:45.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I pursued

00:22:45.384 --> 00:22:47.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
my professional career.

00:22:47.678 --> 00:22:51.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was drafted, it was what I
had been working toward for so many years.

00:22:52.516 --> 00:22:55.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
That first year, it was chaotic,
but then in my second year,

00:22:55.686 --> 00:22:57.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got to a point in my life
where everything was unstable.

00:22:57.897 --> 00:23:02.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that the things
that I was pursuing were fruitless.

00:23:02.652 --> 00:23:05.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just felt hollow inside, right?

00:23:05.154 --> 00:23:08.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like if you shook me, I would rattle.

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:13.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw those who had more money,
more success,

00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:15.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they weren’t happy.

00:23:15.373 --> 00:23:18.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was one of the motivating factors
for me to say: ‘You know what?

00:23:18.793 --> 00:23:20.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There has to be something more.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There has to be,
because I’m at the precipice

00:23:23.631 --> 00:23:25.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘of what I’ve always wanted,

00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:28.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and the only thing that I can see

00:23:28.344 --> 00:23:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more angst,
more headache, more strife.’

00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:35.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was nothing there
that was going to bring lasting happiness,

00:23:35.142 --> 00:23:40.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think that is what motivated me
to want to see what’s in this Bible.

00:23:40.606 --> 00:23:45.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I reached out, and I picked up a study
with a local brother there in Pittsburgh.

00:23:46.028 --> 00:23:50.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a time, I felt like:
‘Man, I can do both of these.

00:23:50.491 --> 00:23:54.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got my craft here, and I’m enjoying it,
and then I have Jehovah.’

00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:59.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a defender in football,
there are certain things that you dream of.

00:24:00.793 --> 00:24:04.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
During one game,
I had one of those opportunities,

00:24:05.047 --> 00:24:07.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t put everything into it

00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:10.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way that I always dreamed
of myself doing.

00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:11.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
I let up.

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:16.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
The person that I was on the inside
was changing.

00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:18.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
That night

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:21.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sat thinking:

00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:23.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re not in the environment
that’s conducive to you

00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:25.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘continuing to grow as a spiritual person.

00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:27.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might need to make some changes.’

00:24:27.278 --> 00:24:30.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that night is when I realized:
‘Hey, you know what?

00:24:31.574 --> 00:24:35.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yeah, I don’t need this.

00:24:36.704 --> 00:24:39.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are you here?
What are you doing?’

00:24:39.332 --> 00:24:42.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is that I loved playing football.

00:24:42.084 --> 00:24:45.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
I enjoyed it,
but it didn’t bring true happiness.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
I retired at a time when I was going
to take the next step with my career.

00:24:52.219 --> 00:24:55.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the offers that were on the table were

00:24:55.681 --> 00:24:57.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
tens of millions of dollars,

00:24:57.683 --> 00:24:59.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that wasn’t what I wanted to do.

00:24:59.935 --> 00:25:02.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
So once I let them know that,
then the offers increased.

00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:05.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that wasn’t what I wanted.

00:25:05.483 --> 00:25:07.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to make the truth my own

00:25:09.028 --> 00:25:11.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get into the full-time ministry.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized September 13, 2015.

00:25:16.452 --> 00:25:18.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
That day was so special

00:25:18.454 --> 00:25:21.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah completely welcomed me
into his spiritual family.

00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:24.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve become a better friend.

00:25:24.293 --> 00:25:25.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve become a better brother.

00:25:25.878 --> 00:25:28.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve become a better son.

00:25:29.757 --> 00:25:33.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are nothing but wins
when you serve Jehovah.

00:25:34.053 --> 00:25:36.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
The joy, the happiness,
that I receive now

00:25:36.514 --> 00:25:39.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why I just rejoice
to be out in the ministry

00:25:39.308 --> 00:25:43.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because you have an opportunity
to actually affect change in someone’s life

00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:47.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them a better person
and give them purpose

00:25:47.274 --> 00:25:51.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have them have
this same warm relationship with Jehovah

00:25:51.987 --> 00:25:53.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have.

00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:55.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s unparalleled.

00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:57.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the fact.

00:25:57.159 --> 00:25:59.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more that we center
our lives around Jehovah,

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
the happier we will be.

00:26:03.707 --> 00:26:05.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where my happiness comes from.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Brother Worilds said,

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:15.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The more we center our life on Jehovah,

00:26:15.094 --> 00:26:18.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
the happier we will be.’

00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:22.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
To many, it seemed he gave up so much

00:26:22.184 --> 00:26:26.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
—fame, wealth, and professional recognition.

00:26:26.897 --> 00:26:29.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in reality,

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
he discovered
what was truly valuable:

00:26:32.862 --> 00:26:36.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good news of truth.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder he was determined
to make it his life’s work.

00:26:40.828 --> 00:26:43.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy that Jason
has been serving

00:26:43.497 --> 00:26:47.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a member
of the United States Bethel family

00:26:47.835 --> 00:26:49.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
since 2017.

00:26:51.213 --> 00:26:54.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love for the truth motivates us

00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:57.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to uphold God’s standards

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to share the truth with others.

00:27:01.974 --> 00:27:06.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you find someone in the ministry
who shows interest,

00:27:06.103 --> 00:27:09.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
are you excited to go back?

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or does heading to that return visit

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:14.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
make you a little uneasy?

00:27:15.362 --> 00:27:19.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d like to be more effective
at making return visits,

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
pay close attention to this next episode

00:27:23.078 --> 00:27:25.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron</i>.

00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:31.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, I’m Marcelo,
and this is <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.”</i>

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:42.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
So we’ve made the initial call,

00:27:42.806 --> 00:27:44.725 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it went really well.

00:27:44.725 --> 00:27:46.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to share a scripture,

00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:48.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had a nice conversation,

00:27:48.771 --> 00:27:51.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we even left the person with a question.

00:27:51.982 --> 00:27:54.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we have to make what

00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:57.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some brothers and sisters
is somewhat difficult:

00:27:57.655 --> 00:27:59.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dreaded return visit.

00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:02.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why do some of us feel that way?

00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:06.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we might worry, thinking:

00:28:06.914 --> 00:28:10.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I tried to return quickly,
but they weren’t there,

00:28:10.751 --> 00:28:13.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘so will they even remember me?

00:28:13.212 --> 00:28:15.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will they still be interested?

00:28:16.131 --> 00:28:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will they ask me a question
I’m not prepared for?’

00:28:19.885 --> 00:28:22.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these might be legitimate concerns,

00:28:22.763 --> 00:28:25.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we need to remember

00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:30.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our goal at this moment
is just to continue a conversation.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s better to focus on what we do know.

00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:36.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
This person has already shown interest.

00:28:36.944 --> 00:28:41.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering that
can help minimize uneasiness.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s also look at three practical steps

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:50.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
that give us the best chance
for a successful return visit.

00:28:50.165 --> 00:28:54.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first step is to be warm and friendly.

00:28:54.086 --> 00:28:57.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
So focus on just getting yourself relaxed.

00:28:57.006 --> 00:29:00.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way you can be warm and friendly
when you greet them.

00:29:00.926 --> 00:29:04.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s natural for some of us
to feel a measure of anxiety

00:29:04.388 --> 00:29:07.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
conversing with someone we don’t know well.

00:29:07.725 --> 00:29:11.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’ve prepared well ahead of time,

00:29:11.604 --> 00:29:14.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can now take a deep breath,

00:29:14.064 --> 00:29:17.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on the value of the message, and smile.

00:29:17.276 --> 00:29:19.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can help us to relax,

00:29:19.737 --> 00:29:22.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
and often our smile is contagious.

00:29:22.156 --> 00:29:23.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m Laura.

00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:27.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last time I was here,
we talked about who controls the world.

00:29:27.369 --> 00:29:28.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I remember.

00:29:28.829 --> 00:29:30.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
You even showed me it is the Devil, right?

00:29:30.623 --> 00:29:32.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s right.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a few minutes,

00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:37.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to answer the question
that I left with you last time:

00:29:37.254 --> 00:29:39.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does God allow suffering?

00:29:39.715 --> 00:29:43.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how she
didn’t put the householder on the spot?

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
She reminded the woman of her name

00:29:45.638 --> 00:29:49.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also of the topic they had discussed
on the initial call.

00:29:49.767 --> 00:29:53.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now she can continue her discussion
right where she left off.

00:29:54.021 --> 00:29:56.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does God allow suffering?

00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:57.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m kind of busy right now,

00:29:57.983 --> 00:30:00.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
but do you mind if I ask you a question?

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:06.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is the moment
we sometimes fear most.

00:30:06.408 --> 00:30:09.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
We plan to continue the discussion,

00:30:09.078 --> 00:30:12.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the householder has
an unexpected question.

00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:16.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s one approach that works well

00:30:16.418 --> 00:30:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we would like to have more time
to prepare a response.

00:30:21.048 --> 00:30:24.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to know if the Bible says anything
about gay marriage.

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:28.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, that’s a really good question.

00:30:28.889 --> 00:30:31.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a way it does talk about that.

00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:36.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
But would it be OK with you
if I answered this other question first?

00:30:36.355 --> 00:30:39.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I can do some research
and find the best possible scriptures

00:30:39.775 --> 00:30:42.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to answer your question
the next time that I come.

00:30:42.277 --> 00:30:43.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound OK?

00:30:43.904 --> 00:30:45.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure, that’s fine.

00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:49.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how our sister
just gave an honest response?

00:30:49.034 --> 00:30:53.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can simply ask if it would be OK
to continue our current discussion

00:30:53.205 --> 00:30:57.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can do some research
and return with a better answer.

00:30:57.334 --> 00:30:59.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most householders will appreciate that.

00:31:01.088 --> 00:31:04.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if the question isn’t too difficult

00:31:04.341 --> 00:31:06.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if we feel comfortable
giving our response,

00:31:06.677 --> 00:31:08.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s fine.

00:31:08.303 --> 00:31:10.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can always adapt.

00:31:10.305 --> 00:31:13.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
The idea is to try to continue our discussion

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:16.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, if necessary, we can always adjust it.

00:31:18.272 --> 00:31:20.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s our last tip:

00:31:21.024 --> 00:31:23.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leave them wanting more.

00:31:23.777 --> 00:31:28.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make sure to keep our visit brief
and leave them wanting more.

00:31:29.032 --> 00:31:31.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
What approach can we use?

00:31:31.076 --> 00:31:33.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Set up a question for the next visit.

00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:36.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huh, that’s interesting.

00:31:36.248 --> 00:31:38.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this thought leads us to another question.

00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:42.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
If God allows suffering to happen,
when will he put an end to it?

00:31:42.421 --> 00:31:44.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good question.

00:31:44.631 --> 00:31:46.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since I mentioned I would be brief,

00:31:46.925 --> 00:31:49.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
could I maybe come back Saturday?

00:31:49.553 --> 00:31:52.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I can answer this question
and also the other one you asked.

00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:54.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that would be great.

00:31:55.017 --> 00:31:56.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is!

00:31:56.226 --> 00:32:00.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three easy steps
that can help us be more comfortable

00:32:00.147 --> 00:32:03.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also help us make
successful return visits:

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be warm and friendly,

00:32:05.444 --> 00:32:07.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue our discussion,

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:09.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leave them wanting more.

00:32:09.948 --> 00:32:12.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know these tips have helped me,

00:32:12.034 --> 00:32:14.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I sure hope they help you

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:16.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we work together to sharpen one another.

00:32:18.165 --> 00:32:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:22.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do the steps outlined by Brother Coelho

00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:26.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
make return visits feel
a little less intimidating?

00:32:27.716 --> 00:32:29.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s our hope,

00:32:29.384 --> 00:32:31.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t want to hold back

00:32:31.428 --> 00:32:35.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
from returning to any of those
who’ve shown interest.

00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:38.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need the accurate knowledge

00:32:38.185 --> 00:32:41.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve been so well-trained to give them.

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:45.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love for the truth

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:49.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
also impels us
to help our fellow worshippers.

00:32:50.072 --> 00:32:53.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we do so
by giving corrective counsel.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should we do it?

00:32:56.703 --> 00:33:01.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Splane shares
some valuable advice along those lines

00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the following morning worship.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.507 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, God’s Word is so rich.

00:33:08.507 --> 00:33:10.300 line:10% position:50% align:center
There’s so much in it,

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.679 line:10% position:50% align:center
and Galatians 6:1 is no exception.

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, please, let’s turn there,

00:33:15.806 --> 00:33:18.058 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read the whole thing.

00:33:18.058 --> 00:33:20.185 line:10% position:50% align:center
And then we’re going to analyze

00:33:20.185 --> 00:33:23.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 6:1 phrase by phrase;

00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:27.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a lot in this one verse.

00:33:27.317 --> 00:33:31.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at Galatians 6:1,

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:33.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul writes:

00:33:33.448 --> 00:33:38.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brothers, even if a man
takes a false step

00:33:38.412 --> 00:33:41.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“before he is aware of it,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you who have spiritual qualifications

00:33:44.543 --> 00:33:49.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“try to readjust such a man
in a spirit of mildness.

00:33:49.548 --> 00:33:52.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But keep an eye on yourself,

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:55.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
for fear you too may be tempted.”

00:33:56.305 --> 00:33:58.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the first word is “brothers.”

00:33:58.932 --> 00:34:02.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we notice that that is in the plural.

00:34:02.477 --> 00:34:07.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
That may be significant, and we’re going to
come back to that in a few minutes.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul says:
“even if a man takes a false step.”

00:34:12.195 --> 00:34:14.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the metaphor here?

00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:17.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Paul thinking about?

00:34:17.242 --> 00:34:19.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Walking.

00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:23.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees a man who is walking down a path.

00:34:23.498 --> 00:34:26.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of a sudden, he “takes a false step.”

00:34:26.376 --> 00:34:27.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, come to think of it,

00:34:27.794 --> 00:34:30.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
this isn’t the first time
that Paul mentions walking

00:34:30.714 --> 00:34:32.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his letter to the Galatians.

00:34:32.716 --> 00:34:36.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cast your eye on chapter 5,

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice verse 16:

00:34:39.765 --> 00:34:43.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I say, Keep walking by spirit

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:48.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will carry out
no fleshly desire at all”;

00:34:48.023 --> 00:34:50.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and again, verse 18:

00:34:50.025 --> 00:34:54.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit,

00:34:54.363 --> 00:34:56.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are not under law”;

00:34:56.907 --> 00:34:59.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and once again, verse 25:

00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:01.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we are living by spirit,

00:35:01.328 --> 00:35:06.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us also go on
walking orderly by spirit”

00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:10.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
—literally walking in a straight line;

00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:12.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then at chapter 6, verse 1:

00:35:12.172 --> 00:35:16.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“brothers, even if a man takes a false step.”

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:20.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul sees a Christian
who is walking along,

00:35:20.055 --> 00:35:22.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking in a straight line,

00:35:22.057 --> 00:35:25.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all of a sudden, he takes a false step.

00:35:25.894 --> 00:35:30.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Question: Is one false step so serious?

00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:35.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those of us who have tried
to walk down

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
the uneven pavement
on Columbia Heights

00:35:39.157 --> 00:35:41.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have taken a false step

00:35:41.326 --> 00:35:43.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we stepped off the curb

00:35:43.745 --> 00:35:47.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wrenched something
or put something out,

00:35:47.165 --> 00:35:52.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can testify
that one false step can be serious.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about you young brothers,
you basketball players?

00:35:55.882 --> 00:35:59.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that sometimes
when you’re on the basketball court,

00:35:59.136 --> 00:36:01.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
you take one false step

00:36:01.555 --> 00:36:04.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you end up on crutches for a few weeks.

00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:09.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the fact is that one false step
can be serious and, interestingly,

00:36:09.896 --> 00:36:13.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Greek word
that’s translated “false step” here

00:36:13.275 --> 00:36:15.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows for a variety of meanings.

00:36:15.402 --> 00:36:18.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can apply to a minor infraction,

00:36:18.864 --> 00:36:21.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it can also apply
to a major transgression

00:36:21.908 --> 00:36:23.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a major sin.

00:36:23.243 --> 00:36:25.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll notice in the comment today
when we read it

00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:30.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Galatians 6:1
is being applied to a serious sin.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it can be applied to both.

00:36:32.669 --> 00:36:34.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s carry on.

00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:39.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
He “takes a false step
before he is aware of it.”

00:36:40.093 --> 00:36:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:36:42.596 --> 00:36:46.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Greek word here

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:49.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates that the sin is not deliberate.

00:36:49.936 --> 00:36:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t leave home that day with the idea

00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:55.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was going to commit a serious sin.

00:36:55.025 --> 00:36:57.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
It came upon him unawares.

00:36:57.444 --> 00:36:59.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was surprised.

00:36:59.112 --> 00:37:01.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps he got into the wrong crowd,

00:37:01.156 --> 00:37:03.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of a sudden,
he ended up doing something

00:37:03.325 --> 00:37:06.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he really hadn’t planned to do.

00:37:06.078 --> 00:37:08.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not deliberate,

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that doesn’t mean
that the sin isn’t serious.

00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:14.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just means that it was not intentional.

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:19.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s help; help is on the way.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “you who have
spiritual qualifications.”

00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:28.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, come to think of it,
the Galatians would know what these are

00:37:28.558 --> 00:37:32.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at chapter 5, verses 22, 23,

00:37:32.145 --> 00:37:34.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul outlined

00:37:34.314 --> 00:37:37.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
the nine aspects
of “the fruitage of the spirit,”

00:37:37.692 --> 00:37:41.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they would know
what the spiritual qualifications are.

00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:45.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the point,
as Brother Devine brought out:

00:37:45.617 --> 00:37:47.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who give counsel

00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:51.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to be motivated by the holy spirit,

00:37:51.373 --> 00:37:55.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
not by frustration, not by anger.

00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:58.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is no knee-jerk reaction,

00:37:58.338 --> 00:38:00.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
a flash of anger or something.

00:38:00.423 --> 00:38:03.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the holy spirit

00:38:03.051 --> 00:38:06.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to move us to give the counsel.

00:38:06.805 --> 00:38:08.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the next word is interesting.

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:13.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “You who have
spiritual qualifications try”

00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:14.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“try.”

00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:17.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you won’t find that word in many Bibles.

00:38:17.607 --> 00:38:20.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think there’s only one other
besides the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:22.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
that says “try.”

00:38:22.654 --> 00:38:25.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the Bible translations
follow the <i>King James Version</i>.

00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:30.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>King James Version</i>  says:
‘You who are spiritual restore the man.’

00:38:30.704 --> 00:38:33.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Greek allows for both.

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:35.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows for an attempt,

00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:38.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it can be a direct action.

00:38:38.253 --> 00:38:41.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, now, the translators have to choose.

00:38:41.631 --> 00:38:46.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original New World Bible
Translation Committee chose “try.”

00:38:46.344 --> 00:38:47.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:38:47.762 --> 00:38:53.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they realized that
while there would be an attempt to readjust,

00:38:53.226 --> 00:38:56.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
the outcome would depend
on the person who was being readjusted.

00:38:56.313 --> 00:38:58.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he really want to change?

00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:02.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it would be successful,
and maybe it wouldn’t.

00:39:02.652 --> 00:39:05.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps because Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:39:05.572 --> 00:39:08.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
probably do more in giving counsel

00:39:08.408 --> 00:39:10.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving help to people than anyone else,

00:39:10.702 --> 00:39:13.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
the translation committee
saw the subtlety

00:39:13.622 --> 00:39:17.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 6:1.

00:39:17.042 --> 00:39:19.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, we have a man walking along.

00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:21.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
He takes a false step.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can happen when you take a false step?

00:39:24.424 --> 00:39:28.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may dislocate a bone.

00:39:28.261 --> 00:39:31.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us to the word “readjust.”

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:34.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Try to readjust such a man.”

00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:39.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you probably know
that the word is a medical term

00:39:39.356 --> 00:39:42.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
for setting a fractured bone in place.

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:44.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it works really well
with the metaphor, doesn’t it?

00:39:44.736 --> 00:39:47.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re walking along, you take a false step,

00:39:47.322 --> 00:39:51.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
something gets out of joint,
and now you have to be readjusted.

00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:55.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bone has to be set in place.

00:39:55.497 --> 00:39:58.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we come to
what Brother Devine was talking about:

00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:02.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a spirit of mildness.”

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s good advice
because sometimes the elders are called upon

00:40:05.674 --> 00:40:10.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counsel someone who has done something
that they find disgusting

00:40:10.887 --> 00:40:14.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their emotions could get involved.

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:18.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may feel like giving the person
a good tongue-lashing,

00:40:18.812 --> 00:40:20.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they don’t.

00:40:20.438 --> 00:40:22.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pray for holy spirit.

00:40:22.274 --> 00:40:25.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s one of the aspects
of the holy spirit?

00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:26.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mildness.

00:40:26.611 --> 00:40:29.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pray for a spirit of mildness.

00:40:29.656 --> 00:40:33.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, if the person
did something that bad,

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:35.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s probably thoroughly ashamed of himself,

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:38.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it may have taken every ounce of courage

00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:41.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
that that person has
just to come to the elders.

00:40:41.543 --> 00:40:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we deal with the person in kindness.

00:40:45.755 --> 00:40:48.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it says: “a spirit of mildness.”

00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:53.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the next phrase is:
“But keep an eye on yourself”

00:40:53.513 --> 00:40:54.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“yourself.”

00:40:54.848 --> 00:40:58.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, that’s singular, isn’t it?

00:40:58.893 --> 00:41:01.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Didn’t we say that
at the beginning of verse 1,

00:41:01.646 --> 00:41:04.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul addressed his “brothers”—plural?

00:41:04.816 --> 00:41:08.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now he is addressing
each and every person

00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:11.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was called upon to give counsel.

00:41:11.197 --> 00:41:15.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Keep an eye on yourself.”

00:41:16.202 --> 00:41:20.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this calls for a self-examination.

00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure that many of us feel very similarly

00:41:24.294 --> 00:41:26.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the comment that was given this morning.

00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:29.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us who have given counsel for years

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:33.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
can look back with regret at times

00:41:33.511 --> 00:41:38.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
—at times when we should have been
more kind, more mild, in giving counsel.

00:41:38.516 --> 00:41:41.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s good for us to undertake

00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:44.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
a self-examination from time to time.

00:41:44.147 --> 00:41:49.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How am I coming across in the counsel
that I’m giving to others?’

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
By using the singular,

00:41:51.112 --> 00:41:53.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is talking to each and every one of us.

00:41:53.698 --> 00:41:55.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are an elder,

00:41:55.909 --> 00:42:00.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is talking to you
and Paul is talking to me,

00:42:00.622 --> 00:42:03.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s saying: “Examine yourself.

00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:07.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Examine how your counsel is coming across.”

00:42:07.545 --> 00:42:12.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
The final phrase is
“for fear you too may be tempted.”

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does Paul mean by that?

00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is he saying that if you hear the details
of what the person has done,

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:21.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may want to do the same thing?

00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:24.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, what he’s reminding us of

00:42:24.938 --> 00:42:28.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we are all imperfect.

00:42:28.358 --> 00:42:31.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is saying to us:
“Don’t get on your high horse.

00:42:31.569 --> 00:42:34.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t be self-righteous
when you’re giving counsel to others.

00:42:34.406 --> 00:42:36.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Remember, you are imperfect.

00:42:36.866 --> 00:42:40.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And one day, you could be sitting
on the other side of the table

00:42:40.245 --> 00:42:42.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and receiving counsel.”

00:42:42.122 --> 00:42:45.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if that were the case,
how would you like to be treated?

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a spirit of mildness.

00:42:48.294 --> 00:42:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping our own limitations in mind

00:42:50.713 --> 00:42:53.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to moderate our tone,

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:57.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak to the offender
in a spirit of mildness.

00:42:57.137 --> 00:42:59.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s reread Galatians 6:1:

00:43:01.015 --> 00:43:03.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brothers,

00:43:03.101 --> 00:43:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if a man takes a false step

00:43:07.439 --> 00:43:09.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“before he is aware of it,

00:43:09.983 --> 00:43:13.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you who have spiritual qualifications

00:43:13.778 --> 00:43:18.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“try to readjust such a man

00:43:18.324 --> 00:43:21.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in a spirit of mildness.

00:43:21.244 --> 00:43:24.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But keep an eye on yourself,

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:28.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
for fear you too may be tempted.”

00:43:28.126 --> 00:43:31.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what can we take away
from this brief discussion?

00:43:31.379 --> 00:43:35.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we can just remember
that counsel must be given in mildness

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
by those who are moved by holy spirit,

00:43:39.345 --> 00:43:41.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
this discussion will have been worth having.

00:43:43.224 --> 00:43:46.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
What practical advice!

00:43:46.144 --> 00:43:49.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we need to provide corrective counsel,

00:43:49.856 --> 00:43:53.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must do so with a spirit of mildness.

00:43:55.778 --> 00:44:00.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked earlier
about how truth moves us to action.

00:44:00.658 --> 00:44:03.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also unites us.

00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:06.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people
speak hundreds of languages

00:44:06.664 --> 00:44:11.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come from almost every imaginable
culture and background,

00:44:11.461 --> 00:44:16.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet we enjoy a peace that is viewed by many

00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:18.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a modern-day miracle.

00:44:19.469 --> 00:44:23.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what this month’s music video
is all about.

00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:28.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called <i>When All Hearts Sing as One</i>.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:46.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earth cries out ev’ry day.
So many have lost their way.

00:44:47.622 --> 00:44:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wars never cease; fighting for peace,
Man cannot find the answers.

00:44:57.507 --> 00:45:05.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through all these stormy seas
And empty philosophies,

00:45:06.474 --> 00:45:15.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provides a hope for mankind,
A world we’re longing to see:

00:45:16.401 --> 00:45:26.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
One faith, one God,
Peace on earth,

00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:37.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
One mind, one voice
Throughout the universe

00:45:39.799 --> 00:45:47.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
When all hearts sing as one.

00:45:53.771 --> 00:46:02.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Know that this hope is sure
Despite what we might endure.

00:46:02.488 --> 00:46:12.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is there and lovingly shares
Peace that flows like a river,

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:20.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Calming our doubts and fears,
Drying up ev’ry tear.

00:46:20.882 --> 00:46:31.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Forever we’ll find true peace of mind,
Knowing soon we will see:

00:46:31.476 --> 00:46:42.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
One faith, one God,
Peace on earth,

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:53.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
One mind, one voice
Throughout the universe

00:46:54.916 --> 00:47:03.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
When all hearts sing as one.

00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:13.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the Prince of Peace,
Freedom will never end.

00:47:13.226 --> 00:47:18.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
When sorrow is gone
and death is undone,

00:47:18.606 --> 00:47:28.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every knee will bend
To Jehovah, our King.

00:47:30.576 --> 00:47:41.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
One faith, one God,
Peace on earth,

00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:52.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
One mind, one voice
Throughout the universe—

00:47:54.016 --> 00:48:04.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
One faith, one God,
Peace on earth,

00:48:04.277 --> 00:48:15.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
One mind, one voice
Throughout the universe

00:48:16.706 --> 00:48:25.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
When all hearts sing as one,

00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:35.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s will on earth is done!

00:48:37.769 --> 00:48:40.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:48:40.188 --> 00:48:43.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
unity isn’t just an ideal.

00:48:43.316 --> 00:48:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a reality!

00:48:46.235 --> 00:48:48.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re gathering at a convention

00:48:48.946 --> 00:48:51.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
or helping each other in a crisis,

00:48:51.657 --> 00:48:55.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love and unity are so clear to see.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:58.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just imagine what it will be like

00:48:58.498 --> 00:49:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
when God’s will for the earth
is fully accomplished

00:49:03.377 --> 00:49:08.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll be at unity
with literally everyone on earth.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:15.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this program,
we’ve seen how important it is

00:49:15.181 --> 00:49:18.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our love for the truth
to permeate our lives.

00:49:19.894 --> 00:49:23.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
That love moves us to hold to God’s standards

00:49:23.105 --> 00:49:26.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them our own,

00:49:26.609 --> 00:49:28.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help interested ones

00:49:28.027 --> 00:49:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
by making effective return visits,

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to remain united at all times.

00:49:38.162 --> 00:49:40.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you hear the word “paradise,”

00:49:40.915 --> 00:49:42.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you think of?

00:49:43.835 --> 00:49:46.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
For many, it might bring to mind

00:49:46.337 --> 00:49:50.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tropical beauty found in Fiji

00:49:50.132 --> 00:49:53.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the location
for this month’s video postcard.

00:49:53.094 --> 00:49:55.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fiji is made up

00:49:55.096 --> 00:49:57.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 300 islands

00:49:57.098 --> 00:49:59.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the South Pacific Ocean,

00:49:59.225 --> 00:50:02.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 100 of which are inhabited.

00:50:02.395 --> 00:50:06.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
On those islands
you’ll find lush rain forests,

00:50:06.858 --> 00:50:08.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
dry grasslands,

00:50:09.861 --> 00:50:13.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pristine lagoons ringed by coral reefs.

00:50:14.073 --> 00:50:18.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you travel inland,
the terrain is steep and rugged,

00:50:18.327 --> 00:50:22.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
with peaks over 1,300 meters high.

00:50:22.081 --> 00:50:25.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s more than 4,200 feet.

00:50:25.418 --> 00:50:27.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this beautiful setting,

00:50:27.837 --> 00:50:31.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are 3,186 publishers

00:50:31.757 --> 00:50:33.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching the good news

00:50:33.426 --> 00:50:35.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
to nearly one million people.

00:50:37.346 --> 00:50:39.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the small island of Koro,

00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:42.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
which lies between Fiji’s two main islands,

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers cover
much of the territory on foot.

00:50:46.814 --> 00:50:49.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
To reach some outlying areas,

00:50:49.233 --> 00:50:51.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may hire a truck,

00:50:51.235 --> 00:50:55.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing older and younger ones
to travel to different villages

00:50:55.573 --> 00:50:57.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a share in the ministry.

00:50:58.576 --> 00:51:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they’re not in the ministry,

00:51:01.037 --> 00:51:05.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
many in the congregation
support their families through farming.

00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:08.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others engage
in the traditional Fijian art

00:51:08.836 --> 00:51:10.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
of mat making.

00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:16.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mats are woven from the long,
narrow leaves of the pandanus,

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:18.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
a tree native to the tropics.

00:51:18.679 --> 00:51:20.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
The leaves are dried,

00:51:20.598 --> 00:51:23.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
dyed by burying them in the mud,

00:51:23.976 --> 00:51:25.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then softened for weaving.

00:51:25.978 --> 00:51:27.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Selling the mats

00:51:27.688 --> 00:51:31.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps many families
pay for travel to circuit assemblies

00:51:31.692 --> 00:51:33.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regional conventions.

00:51:34.487 --> 00:51:38.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
That trip involves a 12-hour boat ride

00:51:38.157 --> 00:51:40.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
over notoriously rough seas

00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:42.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Viti Levu,

00:51:42.703 --> 00:51:44.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fiji’s largest island.

00:51:45.831 --> 00:51:48.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 2016,

00:51:48.209 --> 00:51:51.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cyclone Winston ravaged Fiji.

00:51:51.545 --> 00:51:53.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the time,

00:51:53.172 --> 00:51:56.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was the most powerful storm
ever recorded

00:51:56.842 --> 00:51:58.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:51:59.637 --> 00:52:02.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the small village of Naqaidamu,

00:52:02.682 --> 00:52:06.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of the homes were virtually flattened

00:52:06.268 --> 00:52:09.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our brothers and sisters
lost almost everything they had.

00:52:10.398 --> 00:52:14.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only building that survived
was the Kingdom Hall.

00:52:15.945 --> 00:52:20.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a village chief,
aware of the Witnesses’ good reputation,

00:52:20.157 --> 00:52:22.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
granted them a block of land

00:52:22.618 --> 00:52:25.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
right around the Kingdom Hall

00:52:25.413 --> 00:52:28.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rebuild all their homes.

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Local brothers worked
with disaster relief volunteers

00:52:30.626 --> 00:52:33.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build 14 new homes

00:52:33.546 --> 00:52:35.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
to house the entire congregation.

00:52:37.466 --> 00:52:40.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom Hall at Naqaidamu

00:52:40.052 --> 00:52:42.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
is entirely solar powered,

00:52:42.763 --> 00:52:47.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the local brothers
make good use of technology at the meetings

00:52:47.184 --> 00:52:49.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the field.

00:52:49.353 --> 00:52:50.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 38 publishers

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Naqaidamu Fijian Congregation

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
would like to pass on their <i>loloma </i>
—that’s Fijian for love—

00:52:59.363 --> 00:53:01.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all in their spiritual family.

00:53:02.491 --> 00:53:06.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
