00:00:01 Hello, and thank you for joining us!
00:00:05 What can we look forward to in this month’s broadcast?
00:00:09 We’ll hear from two young people
00:00:11 who chose to live
00:00:13 by God’s moral standards
00:00:15 even when their resolve
00:00:17 was seriously challenged by temptation.
00:00:21 A new music video
00:00:23 celebrates the ways
00:00:24 that God’s people demonstrate
00:00:27 their unity and express their love
00:00:30 for one another.
00:00:32 And we’ll see how one brother learned
00:00:35 that a life centered on Jehovah
00:00:38 is the key to true happiness.
00:00:42 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:46 This is the program for July 2023.
00:01:10 The evening before he died,
00:01:13 Jesus Christ asked his Father in prayer
00:01:16 to watch over his disciples.
00:01:19 His request is recorded at John 17:15-17.
00:01:25 Read it with me.
00:01:27 Jesus said: “I do not request
00:01:31 “that you take them out of the world,
00:01:33 “but that you watch over them
00:01:35 “because of the wicked one.
00:01:37 “They are no part of the world,
00:01:40 just as I am no part of the world.”
00:01:44 Jesus’ confidence in Jehovah
00:01:47 and in the power of the truth
00:01:50 can be seen clearly in what he asks of his Father in verse 17:
00:01:55 “Sanctify them by means of the truth;
00:02:00 your word is truth.”
00:02:04 When we accept the truth
00:02:06 and make a personal dedication to God,
00:02:09 in a general sense,
00:02:11 we are sanctified, or set apart, from the world
00:02:15 because we no longer fit into its mold.
00:02:19 People view us differently
00:02:21 because our values have changed.
00:02:24 We live by the standards of Bible truth,
00:02:28 and doing so honors Jehovah God,
00:02:32 gives our life meaning, and brings us great happiness.
00:02:37 With those thoughts in mind,
00:02:40 how should we feel about the sayings of God
00:02:43 and the Bible truths that we have learned?
00:02:47 We feel the way the psalmist did.
00:02:51 At Psalm 119:140,
00:02:54 he said to Jehovah God:
00:02:57 “Your saying is thoroughly refined
00:03:00 “[which means that it’s clean and pure;
00:03:04 and then he said], and your servant loves it.”
00:03:10 Isn’t that how we feel about the truth?
00:03:12 We love it!
00:03:14 It would be wonderful if everyone would respond to the truth of God’s Word
00:03:19 and love it.
00:03:21 However, the sad fact is that the majority of the world rejects it.
00:03:27 There are many people who do not believe that truth is attainable.
00:03:33 Some ancient philosophers made the teaching of doubts
00:03:36 virtually their life’s work.
00:03:40 Human philosophy is built on pride of intellect
00:03:44 and a warped pleasure of endless speculation
00:03:48 that leaves Jehovah God, the Creator,
00:03:51 completely out of the picture.
00:03:54 By removing God,
00:03:56 philosophers wander in a maze of ideas and theories
00:04:00 that fascinate the mind and inflate the ego
00:04:05 but never arrive at the truth.
00:04:09 If truth were not attainable,
00:04:12 why would Jesus Christ say
00:04:14 as recorded at John 8:31, 32:
00:04:18 “If you remain in my word,
00:04:21 “you are really my disciples,
00:04:24 “and you will know the truth,
00:04:27 and the truth will set you free”?
00:04:30 Are we not experiencing the freedom that Jesus spoke of?
00:04:35 And why would the apostle Paul write at 1 Timothy 2:4
00:04:40 that God’s “will is that all sorts of people
00:04:43 should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth”?
00:04:49 Why does the word “truth” occur over a hundred times
00:04:53 in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
00:04:56 Jesus not only pointed out that the truth is attainable,
00:05:01 but he showed that finding it is required
00:05:04 if our worship is to be approved by God.
00:05:08 When a Samaritan woman wondered
00:05:10 what the true form of worship was
00:05:14 —the worship practiced by the Jews in Jerusalem
00:05:17 or that practiced by the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim—
00:05:22 Jesus did not answer by saying:
00:05:25 ‘Truth is unattainable, and you don’t need to worry about it,’
00:05:29 or ‘You can believe whatever you want to believe.’
00:05:32 No, Jesus did not view the truth as relative
00:05:37 —that whatever you want to believe is the truth.
00:05:41 That is nonsense
00:05:43 and has nothing to do with the realities of life.
00:05:48 At John 4:23, 24,
00:05:52 Jesus made a specific reference to truth,
00:05:56 God’s spirit, and pure worship.
00:05:59 At John 4:23, 24, he said:
00:06:03 “True worshippers
00:06:06 “will worship the Father with spirit and truth,
00:06:09 “for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these
00:06:13 “to worship him.
00:06:15 “God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him
00:06:19 must worship with spirit and truth.”
00:06:23 Jesus was talking about being guided in our worship
00:06:27 by God’s holy spirit
00:06:29 and said that we do not need the use of temples, images,
00:06:33 or other physical objects in true worship.
00:06:37 And the truth that Jesus referred to
00:06:40 is an accurate knowledge of Bible truths.
00:06:45 True faith is much more than just belief in God
00:06:49 —that he exists;
00:06:51 it also means an acceptance of God’s Word,
00:06:55 obtaining an intellectual understanding of that Word,
00:06:59 and then manifesting a heartfelt reliance upon it.
00:07:04 As genuine Christians,
00:07:06 we view the Bible as the inspired Word of God,
00:07:11 beneficial for teaching and disciplining mankind.
00:07:16 Psalm 119:160 says of Jehovah God:
00:07:20 “The very essence of your word is truth.”
00:07:27 When Jesus Christ stood before Pontius Pilate
00:07:30 and told him that he had come to earth to speak the truth,
00:07:34 Pilate responded with the words: “What is truth?”
00:07:39 Likely, Pilate was cynical.
00:07:42 His words reveal a skeptical view of truth.
00:07:46 But the truth that Jesus had in mind was about God’s Kingdom
00:07:51 and Jesus’ role as its King.
00:07:54 That was the very theme, the core,
00:07:57 of Jesus’ teaching while he was on earth.
00:08:01 That’s why when Pilate asked Jesus if he was a king,
00:08:05 Jesus replied:
00:08:07 “You yourself say it.”
00:08:09 In other words, ‘Yes, I am,’
00:08:12 but he added that his Kingdom was “no part of this world.”
00:08:17 The truth is that his Kingdom will sanctify Jehovah’s name,
00:08:22 vindicate his sovereignty,
00:08:25 and restore faithful mankind to happy, eternal life.
00:08:31 Genuine Christians embrace this truth.
00:08:37 Since Jesus’ role in the fulfillment of all of God’s promises is so pivotal
00:08:42 and since all of God’s prophecies
00:08:44 become “Amen,” or true, because of him,
00:08:48 Jesus could well say, as recorded at John 14:6:
00:08:52 “I am the way and the truth and the life.”
00:08:58 And as 2 Corinthians 1:20 declares:
00:09:01 “For no matter how many the promises of God are,
00:09:05 “they have become ‘yes’ by means of him.
00:09:09 “Therefore, also through him
00:09:11 is the ‘Amen’ said to God.”
00:09:15 Jesus used the word “amen”
00:09:18 to affirm the truthfulness of what was said,
00:09:21 but he did so in a unique way.
00:09:25 We usually say “amen” after a prayer is said
00:09:29 to show our agreement with it.
00:09:31 However, rather than use it
00:09:34 to reply to a prayer or a statement,
00:09:37 he used “amen”
00:09:39 to introduce pronouncements of truth.
00:09:42 At times, he repeated the word,
00:09:44 saying “amen, amen” and then made his statement,
00:09:49 which would be like saying
00:09:51 “most truly I say to you.”
00:09:55 Yes, by using this expression,
00:09:58 he assured his listeners that his words were the absolute truth.
00:10:04 Jesus could speak with such certainty
00:10:06 because he was the one authorized
00:10:09 to make all of God’s promises come true.
00:10:14 To us, the exhilarating good news of God’s Kingdom
00:10:18 under the rulership of Jesus Christ
00:10:21 is more, far more, than mere information.
00:10:25 That truth moves us to action;
00:10:28 it compels us to live by it and share it with others.
00:10:34 To the first-century Christian congregation,
00:10:37 the way of life they adopted as followers of Christ
00:10:40 was sometimes known simply as “the truth”
00:10:44 or “the way of the truth.”
00:10:48 Read with me 3 John verse 4, where it says:
00:10:52 “No greater joy do I have than this:
00:10:56 “that I should hear that my children
00:10:59 go on walking in the truth.”
00:11:03 Isn’t that how parents feel about their children
00:11:06 who are serving Jehovah faithfully?
00:11:09 Absolutely!
00:11:11 However, not all young ones
00:11:14 raised in a believing household have stuck with the truth.
00:11:18 The same is true about many with whom we’ve studied the Bible.
00:11:23 Is their situation hopeless?
00:11:26 No, not at all.
00:11:28 There’s still time for them to act
00:11:31 and to show Jehovah that they love him
00:11:34 and that they love the truth.
00:11:37 The end of this system is fast approaching.
00:11:41 It is going to happen and soon.
00:11:45 We encourage such ones to give serious thought
00:11:49 to their relationship with Jehovah God,
00:11:52 because he genuinely loves them
00:11:55 and wants them to have life.
00:11:58 We pray that such ones take whatever steps are necessary
00:12:02 to return to Jehovah before it’s too late.
00:12:07 It’s a Scriptural fact
00:12:09 that people need to love the truth in order to be saved.
00:12:14 This is the point that the apostle Paul makes
00:12:17 at 2 Thessalonians 2:10,
00:12:19 where it reads in part that people will perish
00:12:24 “because they did not accept the love of the truth
00:12:28 in order that they might be saved.”
00:12:32 Our prayer is that honesthearted people everywhere
00:12:36 will respond to Jehovah’s invitation
00:12:39 to draw close to him and love the truth.
00:12:44 This world is heading for an abrupt end
00:12:47 at the battle of Armageddon.
00:12:50 To survive that battle,
00:12:52 we must have knowledge of Jehovah God
00:12:55 and live in harmony with his Word,
00:12:58 which includes the teachings of Jesus Christ.
00:13:03 Earth wide we are proclaiming the good news
00:13:06 that God’s Kingdom has been established in the heavens.
00:13:10 That proclamation
00:13:12 is the foretold “witness to all the nations”
00:13:16 that soon the accomplished end of this world’s system will come.
00:13:20 No, no, not the end of our planet,
00:13:24 because another basic truth is that “the earth remains forever”
00:13:29 as stated at Ecclesiastes 1:4.
00:13:33 These are absolute truths that we preach,
00:13:37 and we love them.
00:13:41 Knowing the truth sets us free from lies,
00:13:45 delusions, and superstitions.
00:13:48 And when we live by it,
00:13:50 the truth strengthens us to endure hardships.
00:13:53 God’s truth is so reliable and well-founded,
00:13:58 and it so inspires us with hope
00:14:01 that it enables us to stand up under any test.
00:14:05 We see our brothers in lands where they are mistreated and persecuted
00:14:09 doing just that, and they do it with joy.
00:14:16 To dismiss truth as relative or nonexistent
00:14:20 is to miss out on the most thrilling
00:14:23 and fulfilling quest that life offers.
00:14:27 To find the truth is to find hope;
00:14:31 to know and love it is to know and love the Creator of the universe
00:14:36 and his only-begotten Son;
00:14:38 to live by it is to live with purpose and peace of mind,
00:14:43 now and forever.
00:14:49 There’s no question
00:14:51 that when we live the truth,
00:14:53 we stand out as different from the world around us.
00:14:58 That’s not easy for any of us.
00:15:00 But if you’re a teenager, it’s especially hard.
00:15:06 Young ones, we know your faith is tested every day.
00:15:11 Your peers question your belief in God,
00:15:14 look down on Bible teachings,
00:15:17 and make fun of your lifestyle.
00:15:20 For your faith to remain strong,
00:15:23 it’s not enough simply to believe what you’ve been taught.
00:15:27 You need solid reasons for what you believe.
00:15:32 That’s why we’re pleased to introduce
00:15:34 a brand-new video series just for you
00:15:38 called Reasons for Faith.
00:15:42 In each episode, young Witnesses like you
00:15:46 talk about why they have faith
00:15:48 and how they keep it strong in a world
00:15:51 that has little or no respect for God’s Word.
00:16:04 Why was it difficult to uphold God’s moral standards at school?
00:16:09 I remember that in high school it was complicated
00:16:12 because my classmates made fun of me.
00:16:15 They often said I acted holier-than-thou and other similar insults
00:16:19 because I didn’t go to nightclubs, I didn’t curse, I didn’t smoke.
00:16:22 It was unbearable because they often tried to push me to the limit.
00:16:26 I had a one-hour bus ride to get to high school,
00:16:28 and I wanted the bus to make a U-turn and avoid going to high school.
00:16:32 I had all the time to think
00:16:34 of what could happen to me and what they could say to me,
00:16:37 and I admit that I sometimes felt alone.
00:16:41 The environment at school often exposed me to immorality.
00:16:44 For example, girls would wear short skirts.
00:16:47 I received instant messages
00:16:48 from people I had never met before.
00:16:50 They would send me photos,
00:16:52 a phone number, or invitations that I could have just simply accepted.
00:16:57 So I could have easily committed sexual immorality.
00:17:02 Sometimes I felt like I was missing out on something important
00:17:05 when I heard my classmates talking about what they were doing
00:17:08 on their evenings and weekends
00:17:10 and about drinking alcohol and new drugs they were trying
00:17:13 or girls they had slept with.
00:17:16 I started to become curious.
00:17:23 What did you do to strengthen your faith?
00:17:28 During family worship with my parents,
00:17:31 we studied the example of Daniel.
00:17:33 Far from his family
00:17:34 among people that didn’t serve Jehovah,
00:17:38 he succeeded in remaining faithful,
00:17:40 and I wanted to do the same.
00:17:42 To strengthen my faith,
00:17:44 I started reading the Bible.
00:17:46 I had to take the metro to get to school,
00:17:47 so every morning I took the opportunity to read a few verses.
00:17:51 I thought about the verses I had read.
00:17:53 By praying to Jehovah,
00:17:55 having a kind of constant conversation with him,
00:17:58 Jehovah would put me in a little bubble.
00:18:00 I started feeling comfortable inside,
00:18:02 and I was no longer under the bad influence of others.
00:18:06 And the fact that I prayed more also made me feel closer to Jehovah.
00:18:10 It was a bit like Psalm 63:7,
00:18:14 which describes how Jehovah shelters us under his immense wings.
00:18:17 Well, that’s exactly how I felt.
00:18:20 Prayer allowed me to face any temptation.
00:18:29 Why do you believe that Jehovah’s standards are beneficial?
00:18:34 I closely observed the young ones in the world,
00:18:37 and I realized that they are suffering from the standards they follow.
00:18:42 I closely stick to the moral standards that Jehovah has given me.
00:18:46 I’m aware that they are there for my benefit,
00:18:49 because with the experiences I’ve had in school,
00:18:51 I’ve observed the painful consequences that my classmates have suffered.
00:18:55 Some got into trouble with the law
00:18:57 or got sick.
00:18:59 They’ve had health problems caused by their lifestyle.
00:19:03 A girl in school did something immoral with a boy,
00:19:07 and it started circulating around the school.
00:19:10 Because of that,
00:19:11 the girl didn’t come to school anymore,
00:19:13 and she started having suicidal thoughts.
00:19:17 I understood that Jehovah protects us with his principles, his standards.
00:19:22 And if I had compromised even once with his standards,
00:19:25 I would have regretted it sooner or later.
00:19:28 And for me, there is nothing worse than regret.
00:19:31 I’m 100 percent sure that Jehovah gave me
00:19:34 these moral principles for my own good
00:19:37 so that I could be morally clean.
00:19:40 He also helps me to be positive.
00:19:42 For example, he helped me to see my classmates
00:19:44 as potential disciples,
00:19:46 and we were able to have conversations about the Bible together.
00:19:49 I am really convinced that Jehovah’s standards are good for me.
00:19:53 Being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the best life possible.
00:20:07 What gave Clara and Hugo the courage
00:20:10 to live by God’s standards when under pressure that, as Clara said,
00:20:15 ‘was sometimes unbearable’?
00:20:18 You heard them.
00:20:20 They are absolutely convinced
00:20:23 that Jehovah’s standards are for their own good.
00:20:27 Is that how you feel?
00:20:30 Why not follow their advice
00:20:32 and dig deeply into God’s Word
00:20:34 to strengthen your confidence in it
00:20:38 and pray to Jehovah for his help
00:20:41 when you face those same pressures?
00:20:47 Real faith has the power to improve people’s lives
00:20:52 in ways they couldn’t have imagined
00:20:55 before learning the truth.
00:20:57 Take our brother Jason Worilds.
00:21:01 He learned that what the world offers
00:21:04 pales in comparison to what Jehovah freely gives us.
00:21:10 News overnight
00:21:12 —Steelers’ linebacker Jason Worilds
00:21:14 is walking away from the NFL
00:21:16 in the prime of his NFL career.
00:21:18 Worilds is or has been with the Steelers
00:21:20 for five seasons and started in all 16 games.
00:21:23 He’s just walking away from tens of millions of dollars.
00:21:26 What is he going to do for the rest of his life?
00:21:28 No clue, but it better be worth it.
00:21:31 My name is Jason Worilds,
00:21:33 and I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:21:36 My mom is a beautiful woman.
00:21:39 It was in her early 20’s
00:21:41 that she was introduced to the Witnesses,
00:21:43 and she started a study, and six months later
00:21:46 she was baptized.
00:21:47 So my mom put the truth before us growing up,
00:21:50 but I didn’t see the true value of what it was that I had.
00:21:52 I didn’t know how true the truth was.
00:21:56 It’s vital that you set spiritual goals.
00:22:00 If you don’t, the reality is that someone is going to set a goal for you,
00:22:04 and I think that’s what was true in my case.
00:22:08 I started playing American football
00:22:10 my freshman year of high school.
00:22:11 One of my coaches sat me down and said,
00:22:14 “You can potentially go to college on a full scholarship.”
00:22:18 I did everything to succeed at football,
00:22:22 and so the dedication—it escalates.
00:22:28 I studied the Bible for several years,
00:22:30 but by the time that I started to make progress in my study,
00:22:34 I was being courted by the NFL.
00:22:37 I was whole-souled to football.
00:22:42 And so I pursued
00:22:45 my professional career.
00:22:47 When I was drafted, it was what I had been working toward for so many years.
00:22:52 That first year, it was chaotic, but then in my second year,
00:22:55 I got to a point in my life where everything was unstable.
00:22:57 I felt that the things that I was pursuing were fruitless.
00:23:02 I just felt hollow inside, right?
00:23:05 I felt like if you shook me, I would rattle.
00:23:09 I saw those who had more money, more success,
00:23:13 and they weren’t happy.
00:23:15 That was one of the motivating factors for me to say: ‘You know what?
00:23:18 ‘There has to be something more.
00:23:20 ‘There has to be, because I’m at the precipice
00:23:23 ‘of what I’ve always wanted,
00:23:25 ‘and the only thing that I can see
00:23:28 is more angst, more headache, more strife.’
00:23:31 There was nothing there that was going to bring lasting happiness,
00:23:35 and I think that is what motivated me to want to see what’s in this Bible.
00:23:40 And so I reached out, and I picked up a study with a local brother there in Pittsburgh.
00:23:46 For a time, I felt like: ‘Man, I can do both of these.
00:23:50 I’ve got my craft here, and I’m enjoying it, and then I have Jehovah.’
00:23:55 As a defender in football, there are certain things that you dream of.
00:24:00 During one game, I had one of those opportunities,
00:24:05 but I didn’t put everything into it
00:24:07 the way that I always dreamed of myself doing.
00:24:10 I let up.
00:24:13 The person that I was on the inside was changing.
00:24:16 That night
00:24:18 I sat thinking:
00:24:21 ‘You’re not in the environment that’s conducive to you
00:24:23 ‘continuing to grow as a spiritual person.
00:24:25 You might need to make some changes.’
00:24:27 And that night is when I realized: ‘Hey, you know what?
00:24:31 ‘Yeah, I don’t need this.
00:24:36 Why are you here? What are you doing?’
00:24:39 The reality is that I loved playing football.
00:24:42 I enjoyed it, but it didn’t bring true happiness.
00:24:47 I retired at a time when I was going to take the next step with my career.
00:24:52 And so the offers that were on the table were
00:24:55 tens of millions of dollars,
00:24:57 and that wasn’t what I wanted to do.
00:24:59 So once I let them know that, then the offers increased.
00:25:03 But that wasn’t what I wanted.
00:25:05 I wanted to make the truth my own
00:25:09 and get into the full-time ministry.
00:25:12 I was baptized September 13, 2015.
00:25:16 That day was so special
00:25:18 because Jehovah completely welcomed me into his spiritual family.
00:25:22 I’ve become a better friend.
00:25:24 I’ve become a better brother.
00:25:25 I’ve become a better son.
00:25:29 There are nothing but wins when you serve Jehovah.
00:25:34 The joy, the happiness, that I receive now
00:25:36 and why I just rejoice to be out in the ministry
00:25:39 is because you have an opportunity to actually affect change in someone’s life
00:25:43 and make them a better person and give them purpose
00:25:47 and have them have this same warm relationship with Jehovah
00:25:51 that you have.
00:25:53 It’s unparalleled.
00:25:55 That’s the fact.
00:25:57 The more that we center our lives around Jehovah,
00:25:59 the happier we will be.
00:26:03 That’s where my happiness comes from.
00:26:09 As Brother Worilds said,
00:26:12 ‘The more we center our life on Jehovah,
00:26:15 the happier we will be.’
00:26:18 To many, it seemed he gave up so much
00:26:22 —fame, wealth, and professional recognition.
00:26:26 But in reality,
00:26:29 he discovered what was truly valuable:
00:26:32 the good news of truth.
00:26:36 No wonder he was determined to make it his life’s work.
00:26:40 We are happy that Jason has been serving
00:26:43 as a member of the United States Bethel family
00:26:47 since 2017.
00:26:51 Our love for the truth motivates us
00:26:54 not only to uphold God’s standards
00:26:57 but also to share the truth with others.
00:27:01 When you find someone in the ministry who shows interest,
00:27:06 are you excited to go back?
00:27:09 Or does heading to that return visit
00:27:12 make you a little uneasy?
00:27:15 If you’d like to be more effective at making return visits,
00:27:19 pay close attention to this next episode
00:27:23 of Iron Sharpens Iron.
00:27:27 Hi, I’m Marcelo, and this is “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:27:40 So we’ve made the initial call,
00:27:42 and it went really well.
00:27:44 We were able to share a scripture,
00:27:46 we had a nice conversation,
00:27:48 and we even left the person with a question.
00:27:51 But then we have to make what
00:27:54 for some brothers and sisters is somewhat difficult:
00:27:57 the dreaded return visit.
00:27:59 But why do some of us feel that way?
00:28:03 Well, we might worry, thinking:
00:28:06 ‘I tried to return quickly, but they weren’t there,
00:28:10 ‘so will they even remember me?
00:28:13 ‘Will they still be interested?
00:28:16 Will they ask me a question I’m not prepared for?’
00:28:19 All of these might be legitimate concerns,
00:28:22 but we need to remember
00:28:25 that our goal at this moment is just to continue a conversation.
00:28:30 It’s better to focus on what we do know.
00:28:33 This person has already shown interest.
00:28:36 Remembering that can help minimize uneasiness.
00:28:42 But let’s also look at three practical steps
00:28:45 that give us the best chance for a successful return visit.
00:28:50 The first step is to be warm and friendly.
00:28:54 So focus on just getting yourself relaxed.
00:28:57 That way you can be warm and friendly when you greet them.
00:29:00 It’s natural for some of us to feel a measure of anxiety
00:29:04 conversing with someone we don’t know well.
00:29:07 But if we’ve prepared well ahead of time,
00:29:11 we can now take a deep breath,
00:29:14 focus on the value of the message, and smile.
00:29:17 This can help us to relax,
00:29:19 and often our smile is contagious.
00:29:22 I’m Laura.
00:29:23 The last time I was here, we talked about who controls the world.
00:29:27 Yes, I remember.
00:29:28 You even showed me it is the Devil, right?
00:29:30 Yeah, that’s right.
00:29:32 If you have a few minutes,
00:29:34 I want to answer the question that I left with you last time:
00:29:37 Why does God allow suffering?
00:29:39 Did you notice how she didn’t put the householder on the spot?
00:29:43 She reminded the woman of her name
00:29:45 and also of the topic they had discussed on the initial call.
00:29:49 Now she can continue her discussion right where she left off.
00:29:54 Why does God allow suffering?
00:29:56 I’m kind of busy right now,
00:29:57 but do you mind if I ask you a question?
00:30:01 Now, this is the moment we sometimes fear most.
00:30:06 We plan to continue the discussion,
00:30:09 but the householder has an unexpected question.
00:30:12 So here’s one approach that works well
00:30:16 if we would like to have more time to prepare a response.
00:30:21 I’d like to know if the Bible says anything about gay marriage.
00:30:25 You know, that’s a really good question.
00:30:28 Well, in a way it does talk about that.
00:30:32 But would it be OK with you if I answered this other question first?
00:30:36 Then I can do some research and find the best possible scriptures
00:30:39 to be able to answer your question the next time that I come.
00:30:42 Does that sound OK?
00:30:43 Sure, that’s fine.
00:30:45 Did you see how our sister just gave an honest response?
00:30:49 We can simply ask if it would be OK to continue our current discussion
00:30:53 so we can do some research and return with a better answer.
00:30:57 Most householders will appreciate that.
00:31:01 But if the question isn’t too difficult
00:31:04 or if we feel comfortable giving our response,
00:31:06 that’s fine.
00:31:08 We can always adapt.
00:31:10 The idea is to try to continue our discussion
00:31:13 but, if necessary, we can always adjust it.
00:31:18 And here’s our last tip:
00:31:21 Leave them wanting more.
00:31:23 Make sure to keep our visit brief and leave them wanting more.
00:31:29 What approach can we use?
00:31:31 Set up a question for the next visit.
00:31:34 Huh, that’s interesting.
00:31:36 So this thought leads us to another question.
00:31:38 If God allows suffering to happen, when will he put an end to it?
00:31:42 That’s a good question.
00:31:44 But since I mentioned I would be brief,
00:31:46 could I maybe come back Saturday?
00:31:49 Then I can answer this question and also the other one you asked.
00:31:52 Yeah, that would be great.
00:31:55 There it is!
00:31:56 Three easy steps that can help us be more comfortable
00:32:00 and also help us make successful return visits:
00:32:03 Be warm and friendly,
00:32:05 continue our discussion,
00:32:07 and leave them wanting more.
00:32:09 I know these tips have helped me,
00:32:12 and I sure hope they help you
00:32:14 as we work together to sharpen one another.
00:32:18 What do you think?
00:32:20 Do the steps outlined by Brother Coelho
00:32:22 make return visits feel a little less intimidating?
00:32:27 That’s our hope,
00:32:29 because we don’t want to hold back
00:32:31 from returning to any of those who’ve shown interest.
00:32:35 They need the accurate knowledge
00:32:38 that we’ve been so well-trained to give them.
00:32:43 Our love for the truth
00:32:45 also impels us to help our fellow worshippers.
00:32:50 Sometimes we do so by giving corrective counsel.
00:32:54 How should we do it?
00:32:56 Brother Splane shares some valuable advice along those lines
00:33:01 in the following morning worship.
00:33:06 Well, God’s Word is so rich.
00:33:08 There’s so much in it,
00:33:10 and Galatians 6:1 is no exception.
00:33:13 So, please, let’s turn there,
00:33:15 and we’re going to read the whole thing.
00:33:18 And then we’re going to analyze
00:33:20 Galatians 6:1 phrase by phrase;
00:33:23 there’s a lot in this one verse.
00:33:27 So at Galatians 6:1,
00:33:31 Paul writes:
00:33:33 “Brothers, even if a man takes a false step
00:33:38 “before he is aware of it,
00:33:41 “you who have spiritual qualifications
00:33:44 “try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness.
00:33:49 “But keep an eye on yourself,
00:33:52 for fear you too may be tempted.”
00:33:56 Now, the first word is “brothers.”
00:33:58 And we notice that that is in the plural.
00:34:02 That may be significant, and we’re going to come back to that in a few minutes.
00:34:07 Now, Paul says: “even if a man takes a false step.”
00:34:12 So, what’s the metaphor here?
00:34:14 What is Paul thinking about?
00:34:17 Walking.
00:34:19 He sees a man who is walking down a path.
00:34:23 And all of a sudden, he “takes a false step.”
00:34:26 Now, come to think of it,
00:34:27 this isn’t the first time that Paul mentions walking
00:34:30 in his letter to the Galatians.
00:34:32 Cast your eye on chapter 5,
00:34:36 and notice verse 16:
00:34:39 “But I say, Keep walking by spirit
00:34:43 and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all”;
00:34:48 and again, verse 18:
00:34:50 “Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit,
00:34:54 you are not under law”;
00:34:56 and once again, verse 25:
00:34:59 “If we are living by spirit,
00:35:01 let us also go on walking orderly by spirit”
00:35:06 —literally walking in a straight line;
00:35:10 and then at chapter 6, verse 1:
00:35:12 “brothers, even if a man takes a false step.”
00:35:16 So Paul sees a Christian who is walking along,
00:35:20 walking in a straight line,
00:35:22 but all of a sudden, he takes a false step.
00:35:25 Question: Is one false step so serious?
00:35:32 Well, those of us who have tried to walk down
00:35:35 the uneven pavement on Columbia Heights
00:35:39 and have taken a false step
00:35:41 as we stepped off the curb
00:35:43 and wrenched something or put something out,
00:35:47 we can testify that one false step can be serious.
00:35:52 And what about you young brothers, you basketball players?
00:35:55 You know that sometimes when you’re on the basketball court,
00:35:59 you take one false step
00:36:01 and you end up on crutches for a few weeks.
00:36:04 So the fact is that one false step can be serious and, interestingly,
00:36:09 the Greek word that’s translated “false step” here
00:36:13 allows for a variety of meanings.
00:36:15 It can apply to a minor infraction,
00:36:18 but it can also apply to a major transgression
00:36:21 —a major sin.
00:36:23 And you’ll notice in the comment today when we read it
00:36:25 that Galatians 6:1 is being applied to a serious sin.
00:36:30 So it can be applied to both.
00:36:32 Let’s carry on.
00:36:34 He “takes a false step before he is aware of it.”
00:36:40 Now, what does that mean?
00:36:42 Well, the Greek word here
00:36:46 indicates that the sin is not deliberate.
00:36:49 He didn’t leave home that day with the idea
00:36:52 that he was going to commit a serious sin.
00:36:55 It came upon him unawares.
00:36:57 He was surprised.
00:36:59 Perhaps he got into the wrong crowd,
00:37:01 and all of a sudden, he ended up doing something
00:37:03 that he really hadn’t planned to do.
00:37:06 It is not deliberate,
00:37:08 but that doesn’t mean that the sin isn’t serious.
00:37:11 It just means that it was not intentional.
00:37:15 Now, here’s help; help is on the way.
00:37:19 It says: “you who have spiritual qualifications.”
00:37:24 Well, come to think of it, the Galatians would know what these are
00:37:28 because at chapter 5, verses 22, 23,
00:37:32 the apostle Paul outlined
00:37:34 the nine aspects of “the fruitage of the spirit,”
00:37:37 so they would know what the spiritual qualifications are.
00:37:41 But here’s the point, as Brother Devine brought out:
00:37:45 Those who give counsel
00:37:47 need to be motivated by the holy spirit,
00:37:51 not by frustration, not by anger.
00:37:55 This is no knee-jerk reaction,
00:37:58 a flash of anger or something.
00:38:00 No, the holy spirit
00:38:03 has to move us to give the counsel.
00:38:06 Now, the next word is interesting.
00:38:08 It says: “You who have spiritual qualifications try”
00:38:13 —“try.”
00:38:14 Now, you won’t find that word in many Bibles.
00:38:17 I think there’s only one other besides the New World Translation
00:38:20 that says “try.”
00:38:22 Most of the Bible translations follow the King James Version.
00:38:25 And the King James Version  says: ‘You who are spiritual restore the man.’
00:38:30 Now, the Greek allows for both.
00:38:33 It allows for an attempt,
00:38:35 or it can be a direct action.
00:38:38 So, now, the translators have to choose.
00:38:41 The original New World Bible Translation Committee chose “try.”
00:38:46 Why?
00:38:47 Well, they realized that while there would be an attempt to readjust,
00:38:53 the outcome would depend on the person who was being readjusted.
00:38:56 Would he really want to change?
00:38:58 Maybe it would be successful, and maybe it wouldn’t.
00:39:02 And perhaps because Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:39:05 probably do more in giving counsel
00:39:08 and giving help to people than anyone else,
00:39:10 the translation committee saw the subtlety
00:39:13 at Galatians 6:1.
00:39:17 Well, now, we have a man walking along.
00:39:19 He takes a false step.
00:39:21 What can happen when you take a false step?
00:39:24 You may dislocate a bone.
00:39:28 And that brings us to the word “readjust.”
00:39:31 He says: “Try to readjust such a man.”
00:39:34 Now, you probably know that the word is a medical term
00:39:39 for setting a fractured bone in place.
00:39:42 So it works really well with the metaphor, doesn’t it?
00:39:44 You’re walking along, you take a false step,
00:39:47 something gets out of joint, and now you have to be readjusted.
00:39:51 The bone has to be set in place.
00:39:55 And now we come to what Brother Devine was talking about:
00:39:58 “in a spirit of mildness.”
00:40:02 And that’s good advice because sometimes the elders are called upon
00:40:05 to counsel someone who has done something that they find disgusting
00:40:10 and their emotions could get involved.
00:40:14 They may feel like giving the person a good tongue-lashing,
00:40:18 but they don’t.
00:40:20 They pray for holy spirit.
00:40:22 And what’s one of the aspects of the holy spirit?
00:40:25 Mildness.
00:40:26 They pray for a spirit of mildness.
00:40:29 After all, if the person did something that bad,
00:40:33 he’s probably thoroughly ashamed of himself,
00:40:35 and it may have taken every ounce of courage
00:40:38 that that person has just to come to the elders.
00:40:41 So we deal with the person in kindness.
00:40:45 So it says: “a spirit of mildness.”
00:40:48 And then the next phrase is: “But keep an eye on yourself”
00:40:53 —“yourself.”
00:40:54 Wait a minute, that’s singular, isn’t it?
00:40:58 Didn’t we say that at the beginning of verse 1,
00:41:01 Paul addressed his “brothers”—plural?
00:41:04 But now he is addressing each and every person
00:41:08 who was called upon to give counsel.
00:41:11 Paul says: “Keep an eye on yourself.”
00:41:16 Now, this calls for a self-examination.
00:41:20 I’m sure that many of us feel very similarly
00:41:24 to the comment that was given this morning.
00:41:26 Many of us who have given counsel for years
00:41:29 can look back with regret at times
00:41:33 —at times when we should have been more kind, more mild, in giving counsel.
00:41:38 And so it’s good for us to undertake
00:41:41 a self-examination from time to time.
00:41:44 ‘How am I coming across in the counsel that I’m giving to others?’
00:41:49 By using the singular,
00:41:51 Paul is talking to each and every one of us.
00:41:53 If you are an elder,
00:41:55 Paul is talking to you and Paul is talking to me,
00:42:00 and he’s saying: “Examine yourself.
00:42:03 Examine how your counsel is coming across.”
00:42:07 The final phrase is “for fear you too may be tempted.”
00:42:12 Now, what does Paul mean by that?
00:42:14 Is he saying that if you hear the details of what the person has done,
00:42:19 you may want to do the same thing?
00:42:21 No, what he’s reminding us of
00:42:24 is that we are all imperfect.
00:42:28 Paul is saying to us: “Don’t get on your high horse.
00:42:31 “Don’t be self-righteous when you’re giving counsel to others.
00:42:34 “Remember, you are imperfect.
00:42:36 “And one day, you could be sitting on the other side of the table
00:42:40 and receiving counsel.”
00:42:42 And if that were the case, how would you like to be treated?
00:42:45 In a spirit of mildness.
00:42:48 Keeping our own limitations in mind
00:42:50 will help us to moderate our tone,
00:42:53 to speak to the offender in a spirit of mildness.
00:42:57 So let’s reread Galatians 6:1:
00:43:01 “Brothers,
00:43:03 “even if a man takes a false step
00:43:07 “before he is aware of it,
00:43:09 “you who have spiritual qualifications
00:43:13 “try to readjust such a man
00:43:18 “in a spirit of mildness.
00:43:21 “But keep an eye on yourself,
00:43:24 for fear you too may be tempted.”
00:43:28 Well, what can we take away from this brief discussion?
00:43:31 If we can just remember that counsel must be given in mildness
00:43:35 by those who are moved by holy spirit,
00:43:39 this discussion will have been worth having.
00:43:43 What practical advice!
00:43:46 If we need to provide corrective counsel,
00:43:49 we must do so with a spirit of mildness.
00:43:55 We talked earlier about how truth moves us to action.
00:44:00 It also unites us.
00:44:03 Jehovah’s people speak hundreds of languages
00:44:06 and come from almost every imaginable culture and background,
00:44:11 yet we enjoy a peace that is viewed by many
00:44:16 as a modern-day miracle.
00:44:19 That’s what this month’s music video is all about.
00:44:23 It’s called When All Hearts Sing as One.
00:44:38 Earth cries out ev’ry day. So many have lost their way.
00:44:47 Wars never cease; fighting for peace, Man cannot find the answers.
00:44:57 Through all these stormy seas And empty philosophies,
00:45:06 Jehovah provides a hope for mankind, A world we’re longing to see:
00:45:16 One faith, one God, Peace on earth,
00:45:26 One mind, one voice Throughout the universe
00:45:39 When all hearts sing as one.
00:45:53 Know that this hope is sure Despite what we might endure.
00:46:02 Jehovah is there and lovingly shares Peace that flows like a river,
00:46:12 Calming our doubts and fears, Drying up ev’ry tear.
00:46:20 Forever we’ll find true peace of mind, Knowing soon we will see:
00:46:31 One faith, one God, Peace on earth,
00:46:42 One mind, one voice Throughout the universe
00:46:54 When all hearts sing as one.
00:47:04 Under the Prince of Peace, Freedom will never end.
00:47:13 When sorrow is gone and death is undone,
00:47:18 Every knee will bend To Jehovah, our King.
00:47:30 One faith, one God, Peace on earth,
00:47:41 One mind, one voice Throughout the universe—
00:47:54 One faith, one God, Peace on earth,
00:48:04 One mind, one voice Throughout the universe
00:48:16 When all hearts sing as one,
00:48:26 God’s will on earth is done!
00:48:37 Among Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:48:40 unity isn’t just an ideal.
00:48:43 It’s a reality!
00:48:46 Whether we’re gathering at a convention
00:48:48 or helping each other in a crisis,
00:48:51 our love and unity are so clear to see.
00:48:55 And just imagine what it will be like
00:48:58 when God’s will for the earth is fully accomplished
00:49:03 and we’ll be at unity with literally everyone on earth.
00:49:11 In this program, we’ve seen how important it is
00:49:15 for our love for the truth to permeate our lives.
00:49:19 That love moves us to hold to God’s standards
00:49:23 and make them our own,
00:49:26 to help interested ones
00:49:28 by making effective return visits,
00:49:31 and to remain united at all times.
00:49:38 When you hear the word “paradise,”
00:49:40 what do you think of?
00:49:43 For many, it might bring to mind
00:49:46 the tropical beauty found in Fiji
00:49:50 —the location for this month’s video postcard.
00:49:53 Fiji is made up
00:49:55 of more than 300 islands
00:49:57 in the South Pacific Ocean,
00:49:59 about 100 of which are inhabited.
00:50:02 On those islands you’ll find lush rain forests,
00:50:06 dry grasslands,
00:50:09 and pristine lagoons ringed by coral reefs.
00:50:14 If you travel inland, the terrain is steep and rugged,
00:50:18 with peaks over 1,300 meters high.
00:50:22 That’s more than 4,200 feet.
00:50:25 In this beautiful setting,
00:50:27 there are 3,186 publishers
00:50:31 preaching the good news
00:50:33 to nearly one million people.
00:50:37 On the small island of Koro,
00:50:39 which lies between Fiji’s two main islands,
00:50:42 our brothers cover much of the territory on foot.
00:50:46 To reach some outlying areas,
00:50:49 they may hire a truck,
00:50:51 allowing older and younger ones to travel to different villages
00:50:55 to have a share in the ministry.
00:50:58 When they’re not in the ministry,
00:51:01 many in the congregation support their families through farming.
00:51:06 Others engage in the traditional Fijian art
00:51:08 of mat making.
00:51:11 The mats are woven from the long, narrow leaves of the pandanus,
00:51:16 a tree native to the tropics.
00:51:18 The leaves are dried,
00:51:20 dyed by burying them in the mud,
00:51:23 and then softened for weaving.
00:51:25 Selling the mats
00:51:27 helps many families pay for travel to circuit assemblies
00:51:31 and regional conventions.
00:51:34 That trip involves a 12-hour boat ride
00:51:38 over notoriously rough seas
00:51:40 to Viti Levu,
00:51:42 Fiji’s largest island.
00:51:45 Back in 2016,
00:51:48 Cyclone Winston ravaged Fiji.
00:51:51 At the time,
00:51:53 it was the most powerful storm ever recorded
00:51:56 in the Southern Hemisphere.
00:51:59 In the small village of Naqaidamu,
00:52:02 most of the homes were virtually flattened
00:52:06 and our brothers and sisters lost almost everything they had.
00:52:10 The only building that survived was the Kingdom Hall.
00:52:15 But a village chief, aware of the Witnesses’ good reputation,
00:52:20 granted them a block of land
00:52:22 right around the Kingdom Hall
00:52:25 to rebuild all their homes.
00:52:28 Local brothers worked with disaster relief volunteers
00:52:30 to build 14 new homes
00:52:33 to house the entire congregation.
00:52:37 The Kingdom Hall at Naqaidamu
00:52:40 is entirely solar powered,
00:52:42 and the local brothers make good use of technology at the meetings
00:52:47 and in the field.
00:52:49 The 38 publishers
00:52:50 of the Naqaidamu Fijian Congregation
00:52:54 would like to pass on their loloma  —that’s Fijian for love—
00:52:59 to all in their spiritual family.
