00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:06.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greetings and a hearty welcome
to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:12.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, I’m joined by my cohost and friend,
Don Gordon.

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don, what do we have in store
for this month’s program?

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all want to look our best.

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it possible
to care too much about our appearance?

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:26.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tony and Samantha
will tell us what they learned.

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many years ago,

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Janice found the comfort and courage

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
she needed to cope
with discouraging circumstances.

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll catch up with her
in the next episode of the series

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Where Are They Now? </i>

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:42.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, we’ll debut a new series

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will bring Bible characters to life.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s get started.

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the September 2023 edition

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:18.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month,
I’d like to talk to you on the subject

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:23.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah Loves You
Despite Appearances or Imperfections.”

00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:26.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
You’ll likely notice

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
there are two areas we’ll discuss:

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:33.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
our appearance and our imperfections.

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:37.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why address these two aspects?

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:41.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because there’s a percentage
of Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:46.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wonder if Jehovah can really love them

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of one of those two reasons

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:52.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
or both.

00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:54.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take appearances first.

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’ve gotten all cleaned up

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:59.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are fully dressed each day

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:03.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you glance in a full-length mirror,

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:07.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
are you pleased with the way you look?

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to change a few things,
but you can’t?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us tend to compare ourselves

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:18.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
to other imperfect humans

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:22.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adopt the thinking of the masses.

00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Movies and television

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
have blinded many to reality,

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:31.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
making them feel
that the beauty of the human body

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:36.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
must look like the handsome
and beautiful movie stars

00:02:36.262 --> 00:02:38.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and famed athletes.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:43.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, comparing ourselves to them

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:46.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often be very disappointing,

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:50.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
time consuming, and even expensive

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:52.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you go to great lengths

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:57.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to look more like another person.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that some have been born

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:04.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a physical impairment or disability.

00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:06.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may be obvious to others,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some unkind people
might have made comments

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
or teased the person.

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can make the person feel self-conscious

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:21.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even create a feeling of low self-esteem.

00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:26.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can become so ingrained
in one’s thinking

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:30.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he might begin to feel
no one could love him.

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at times, that kind of erroneous thinking

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
can even affect a person’s view

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:41.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s love.

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:44.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, please be assured

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah loves us

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:50.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our physical appearance.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been said, “Beauty is only skin-deep.”

00:03:57.553 --> 00:03:59.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
It fades with time.

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just look at a picture of yourself

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you were, let’s say, 17,

00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:10.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then look at one
when you are in your 80’s.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
You say, “That’s not me.”

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:14.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, it is!

00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:20.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans are sometimes enamored
by appearances.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t mean to do this,

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:26.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we may get caught up in this trap.

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:32.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
A faithful prophet of Jehovah
fell into this type of reasoning.

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:34.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember when Jehovah told Samuel

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:37.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anoint the next king of Israel?

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:41.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Samuel 16:3,

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:46.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told Samuel to go
to Jesse in Bethlehem,

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there He said:

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must anoint for me
the one whom I designate to you.”

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have that in your mind?

00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:02.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Samuel, you must anoint

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:07.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one whom I designate to you.’

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:14.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuel defaulted
to the way humans sometimes view others,

00:05:14.422 --> 00:05:16.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
or appearances.

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:18.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read what happened.

00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:23.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s recorded at 1 Samuel 16:6.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads:

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:29.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they came in and he saw Eliab,

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:33.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he said: ‘Surely here before Jehovah

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:36.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
stands his anointed one.’”

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:41.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samuel didn’t really know Eliab.

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:45.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was impressed with his appearance.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was tall

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:50.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely a good-looking man.

00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read along with me on the screen verse 7.

00:05:57.508 --> 00:06:02.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s way of assessing our worth
before him is very different.

00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:04.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 7 says:

00:06:05.224 --> 00:06:08.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Jehovah said to Samuel:

00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:12.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not pay attention
to his appearance

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:14.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and how tall he is,

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:17.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for I have rejected him.

00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:19.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[now note this]

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For the way man sees

00:06:21.532 --> 00:06:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is not the way God sees,

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:29.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because mere man sees
what appears to the eyes,

00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:33.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”

00:06:33.503 --> 00:06:37.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s view of beauty
is different from ours.

00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:41.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Close your literal eyes for a minute,
and see with your mind’s eye

00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:43.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful bird.

00:06:44.764 --> 00:06:46.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now open your eyes.

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:49.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which bird did you see?

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it an indigo bunting,

00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:56.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
a cardinal, or a Baltimore oriole?

00:06:56.568 --> 00:06:59.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are beautiful birds.

00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:04.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does Jehovah prefer one bird over another

00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:09.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
just because of its beauty or appearance?

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:13.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
What bird did Jesus choose

00:07:13.043 --> 00:07:16.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
in teaching his disciples
a valuable lesson about Jehovah?

00:07:17.881 --> 00:07:19.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used a sparrow

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:24.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a plain, somewhat drab-looking little bird

00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:27.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
of small monetary value.

00:07:28.308 --> 00:07:30.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow along on-screen as I read

00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:34.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 10:29-31:

00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:39.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value,
do they not?

00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:43.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet not one of them will fall to the ground

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“without your Father’s knowledge.

00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:51.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But even the hairs of your head
are all numbered.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So have no fear;

00:07:53.292 --> 00:07:58.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are worth more than many sparrows.”

00:07:58.964 --> 00:08:02.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus represented Jehovah’s view

00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:06.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those
who have dedicated themselves to him

00:08:06.514 --> 00:08:10.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are trying to remain faithful.

00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:11.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah likely notices
when an indigo bunting,

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:20.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
a cardinal, or a Baltimore oriole
falls to the ground.

00:08:21.445 --> 00:08:24.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus made a significant point

00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:29.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he chose to use
a sparrow in his illustration.

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:32.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is not impressed

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:36.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the beauty of one’s physical appearance.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves us as much as he loves

00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of his faithful servants

00:08:42.258 --> 00:08:45.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our appearance.

00:08:45.178 --> 00:08:49.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus went a step further and said:

00:08:49.724 --> 00:08:54.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are worth more than many sparrows.”

00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:58.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not just a bird.

00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:01.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are a precious human

00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:04.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has come to know and love Jehovah.

00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:09.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves you, not because of your appearance

00:09:09.953 --> 00:09:13.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being handsome, drab-looking,

00:09:13.123 --> 00:09:15.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
short, heavy,

00:09:15.542 --> 00:09:17.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
skinny, bald,

00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:21.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautiful, less-than-beautiful,

00:09:21.173 --> 00:09:25.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
having warts or a limp or missing limbs,

00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:30.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
being cross-eyed
or having a different skin color

00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:32.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
or shape of your eyes.

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:35.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah loves you

00:09:35.729 --> 00:09:39.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of who you are at heart.

00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:45.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what Jehovah told Samuel?

00:09:45.989 --> 00:09:49.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:53.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah looks at you and sees

00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:00.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the secret person of the heart”

00:10:00.838 --> 00:10:03.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
that came to love your God,

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:05.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Universal Sovereign.

00:10:05.843 --> 00:10:09.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot take that aspect away
from the attention of Jehovah.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you love him like Jesus indicates you can,

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loves you

00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:20.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite any external appearances.

00:10:22.777 --> 00:10:26.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll likely remember what Jesus said
at Mark 12:30:

00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:29.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:33.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your whole heart

00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:35.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with your whole soul

00:10:35.915 --> 00:10:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with your whole mind

00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:40.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with your whole strength.”

00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:43.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s it!

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:46.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not add

00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:49.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your good looks.”

00:10:49.137 --> 00:10:53.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, your appearance is not a factor

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:58.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your love for Jehovah or his love for you.

00:10:59.814 --> 00:11:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you say: “I’m crippled in both feet.

00:11:04.152 --> 00:11:06.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have trouble walking.

00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:08.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel dead inside.”

00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:13.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not the first servant of Jehovah
to feel that way.

00:11:13.995 --> 00:11:17.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth evidently felt that way.

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
He too was crippled in both feet.

00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:23.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
King David had just honored him

00:11:23.713 --> 00:11:26.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
by promising to give him property

00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the privilege
of eating his meals with the king.

00:11:30.595 --> 00:11:32.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Mephibosheth

00:11:32.597 --> 00:11:34.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt about himself

00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:37.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel 9:8:

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:40.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What is your servant,

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have turned your attention
to a dead dog like me?”

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:49.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not have a high opinion of himself.

00:11:49.698 --> 00:11:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sounds like low self-esteem, doesn’t it?

00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:59.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a physical impairment
or a defect,

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:01.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re not dead

00:12:01.585 --> 00:12:05.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
but very much alive in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to what Jehovah tells you

00:12:07.842 --> 00:12:10.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Malachi 4:2:

00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:14.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But on you who honor my name,

00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:17.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the sun of righteousness will shine,

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:20.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with healing in its rays;

00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:24.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will skip about
like fattened calves.”

00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:28.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do what you can
with what you have to work with

00:12:28.988 --> 00:12:30.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing Jehovah loves you

00:12:30.698 --> 00:12:34.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ultimately will correct
any physical problem.

00:12:35.369 --> 00:12:38.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll then be able to live for all eternity

00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:42.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
without any concerns about your appearance.

00:12:43.252 --> 00:12:46.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s talk about Jehovah’s love for us

00:12:46.214 --> 00:12:49.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our imperfections.

00:12:51.094 --> 00:12:55.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a human, you’re imperfect.

00:12:55.431 --> 00:12:58.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, that’s just the way it is.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:01.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam passed imperfection on to all of us.

00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:08.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being imperfect, we will all make mistakes.

00:13:08.403 --> 00:13:10.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all do without exception.

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:17.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll be embarrassed
at your imperfect reaction at times.

00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:19.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it happens.

00:13:19.414 --> 00:13:22.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows our condition.

00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:26.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows what Adam handed down to us.

00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:31.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he still loves us despite imperfection.

00:13:32.636 --> 00:13:35.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really is not our fault.

00:13:37.891 --> 00:13:41.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can Jehovah still love us
when we make mistakes,

00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
use poor judgment on occasion,

00:13:44.773 --> 00:13:48.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at times fall into serious sin

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:51.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
(though we’re sorry and repentant afterward)?

00:13:53.282 --> 00:13:56.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:13:57.745 --> 00:14:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Mark 10:45 from the screen:

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:06.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For even the Son of man came,

00:14:06.086 --> 00:14:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not to be ministered to,

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:11.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but to minister and to give his life

00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:15.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a ransom in exchange for many.”

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:20.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus absorbs our mistakes.

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is possible
because he gave his perfect human life for us

00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:27.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
in exchange for what Adam lost

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and passed on to us.

00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:36.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look with me at 1 Corinthians 15:22:

00:14:36.868 --> 00:14:40.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For just as in Adam all are dying,

00:14:40.872 --> 00:14:45.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
so also in the Christ
all will be made alive.”

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s beautiful.

00:14:48.004 --> 00:14:52.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not hold
our imperfections against us.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as we acknowledge our imperfections

00:14:56.763 --> 00:15:00.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel remorse and are repentant,

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loves us despite the issue.

00:15:06.147 --> 00:15:08.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:1-5

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:13.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that in time humans will experience

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:16.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
the removal of tears,

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:18.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
mourning, outcry,

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:21.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
pain, and even death.

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:24.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these painful situations

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:28.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
are based on the sin of Adam.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:31.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will then be gone.

00:15:33.008 --> 00:15:35.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
For obedient humans,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
this means a return

00:15:37.387 --> 00:15:40.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the perfect state enjoyed by man

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the beginning of human history

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:44.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the garden of Eden.

00:15:44.937 --> 00:15:47.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
So humans will be able to enjoy

00:15:47.064 --> 00:15:51.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only perfection as to faith and love

00:15:51.193 --> 00:15:55.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
but perfection as to sinlessness.

00:15:56.699 --> 00:16:01.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, they’ll measure up
fully and faultlessly

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:04.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s righteous standards for humans.

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:08.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine that glorious time?

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:12.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, perfection at that time

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:16.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not mean an end to variety,

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:19.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
as some persons often assume.

00:16:19.722 --> 00:16:21.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
The animal kingdom,

00:16:21.724 --> 00:16:25.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the product
of Jehovah’s perfect activity,

00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:27.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
contains enormous variety.

00:16:29.273 --> 00:16:33.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our perfect earth
is likewise filled with variety,

00:16:33.903 --> 00:16:36.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
change, and contrast.

00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:41.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows for the simple and the complex,

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:44.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
the plain and the fancy,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sour and the sweet,

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:51.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rough and the smooth,

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:55.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
the meadows and the woods,

00:16:55.425 --> 00:16:58.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mountains and the valleys.

00:16:58.428 --> 00:17:02.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
It embraces the stimulating freshness

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
of early spring,

00:17:04.517 --> 00:17:07.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
the warmth of summer,

00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:10.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
the loveliness of autumn colors,

00:17:10.482 --> 00:17:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the pure beauty

00:17:13.068 --> 00:17:16.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
of freshly fallen snow.

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:20.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perfect humans will not be stereotypes

00:17:20.617 --> 00:17:25.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
with identical personalities,
talents, and abilities.

00:17:25.956 --> 00:17:27.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the beauty is that

00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all of the variety of appearances,

00:17:32.212 --> 00:17:34.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
talents, and personalities,

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:39.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfection will be no more.

00:17:40.387 --> 00:17:42.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please be assured that,

00:17:42.598 --> 00:17:45.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ve considered from the Scriptures,

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves each one of us

00:17:48.604 --> 00:17:53.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our appearances or imperfections.

00:17:53.817 --> 00:17:56.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all fully love

00:17:56.487 --> 00:17:59.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adore Jehovah

00:17:59.073 --> 00:18:03.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son, Christ Jesus, in return!

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Herd,
for those encouraging reminders.

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:12.086 line:10% position:50% align:center
We know our young people want to look good,

00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:14.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
but how do you avoid becoming obsessed

00:18:14.422 --> 00:18:16.424 line:10% position:50% align:center
with how you look?

00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:20.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the topic of the next episode
of the series <i>My Teen Life.</i>

00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:29.437 line:10% position:50% align:center
Oh, most definitely I felt awkward.

00:18:29.437 --> 00:18:32.315 line:10% position:50% align:center
I didn’t wear my clothes a certain way,

00:18:32.315 --> 00:18:36.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
or I didn’t have my hair kept a certain way.

00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:38.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t wear the latest shoes.

00:18:38.488 --> 00:18:40.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
It can be really easy to get caught up

00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:41.199 line:10% position:50% align:center
on social media,

00:18:41.199 --> 00:18:43.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to see what the new trends are

00:18:43.534 --> 00:18:45.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to see how others look.

00:18:45.244 --> 00:18:46.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Should I look like that?

00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:49.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t I look like that?
What can I do to look like that?’

00:18:49.332 --> 00:18:51.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I paid such a high price

00:18:51.626 --> 00:18:54.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the body I was going after.

00:18:56.172 --> 00:18:58.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was going
after unrealistic beauty standards.

00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:02.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
It lead me to being diagnosed
with an eating disorder.

00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:06.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
My focusing on my appearance too much
affected me spiritually.

00:19:06.683 --> 00:19:10.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was in service,
even though I was at a meeting,

00:19:10.979 --> 00:19:15.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though I was present for family worship
—I wasn’t focused.

00:19:15.275 --> 00:19:17.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thinking more
of what I’m going to wear tomorrow.

00:19:17.861 --> 00:19:20.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents were a great help.

00:19:20.697 --> 00:19:23.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took time
to actually listen to my feelings

00:19:23.825 --> 00:19:26.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what I was going through.

00:19:26.077 --> 00:19:28.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not necessarily a formal setting.

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:31.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was actually in informal settings

00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:33.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
—where we could be in the car
and we were just talking

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we were sitting on the couch
and watching TV—

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my dad would just talk to me

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind of see how I was doing,
how my day went.

00:19:41.009 --> 00:19:43.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father, he kind of sat me down,

00:19:43.303 --> 00:19:47.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he shared
two really important scriptures with me:

00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 3:3, 4, where it says:

00:19:50.727 --> 00:19:53.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not let your adornment be external.”

00:19:54.398 --> 00:19:57.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t want to focus too much
on how you look,

00:19:57.401 --> 00:19:59.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your outer appearance,

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reason being found at Proverbs 31:30,

00:20:03.532 --> 00:20:06.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says: “Beauty may be fleeting.”

00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:12.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though we may put so much effort
into how we look,

00:20:12.249 --> 00:20:15.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our outer appearance,
eventually that’s going to go away.

00:20:15.795 --> 00:20:18.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that has really helped me is

00:20:18.714 --> 00:20:20.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving myself time in the day

00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get off of social media
—getting off the Internet

00:20:24.387 --> 00:20:27.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving time (dedicating time) to Jehovah.

00:20:27.265 --> 00:20:30.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
I unfollowed models and influencers

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:33.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made me feel more insecure about myself,

00:20:33.688 --> 00:20:37.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would study
Bible characters of the past,

00:20:37.692 --> 00:20:38.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Abigail,

00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:40.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah,

00:20:40.278 --> 00:20:41.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ruth.

00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:45.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Letting myself be influenced by them

00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:47.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a game changer for me.

00:20:47.368 --> 00:20:50.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
What made them more beautiful
in the eyes of Jehovah

00:20:50.622 --> 00:20:54.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
were their qualities,
how they treated others, their personality,

00:20:54.918 --> 00:20:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they served Jehovah with loyalty.

00:20:56.961 --> 00:21:01.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I examined those scriptures,
I feel like something clicked in my head.

00:21:01.257 --> 00:21:04.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being attractive physically

00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:08.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it just didn’t really make
much of a difference to me anymore.

00:21:08.973 --> 00:21:12.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
By making sure I prayed
before my day started,

00:21:12.352 --> 00:21:15.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned to really let Jehovah in

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make my prayers meaningful.

00:21:17.774 --> 00:21:19.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were a few elders—

00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:23.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even became almost as close
as best friends to me.

00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:26.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders really helped me

00:21:26.908 --> 00:21:31.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it came to how I could take
more attention off of myself

00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:34.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how I could focus on helping others.

00:21:36.043 --> 00:21:38.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that I’m making Jehovah happy

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:41.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping others get to know him
and making disciples

00:21:41.882 --> 00:21:43.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what makes me happy now.

00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:47.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a pioneer,
I finally was able to attend

00:21:47.095 --> 00:21:50.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
my first pioneer school
in March of 2021,

00:21:50.474 --> 00:21:53.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was an amazing blessing from Jehovah.

00:21:53.185 --> 00:21:56.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work on being more open with people,

00:21:56.563 --> 00:22:00.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
on being more present,
on being more available.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
And trust me, it’s paid off for me,

00:22:06.782 --> 00:22:10.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
because eventually I received

00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:13.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
many more privileges in the congregation.

00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:18.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to serve in different capacities
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:22.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
And above all, I was more happy.

00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:46.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Tony and Samantha,
for those candid experiences.

00:22:46.072 --> 00:22:48.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cultivating kindness and goodness

00:22:48.574 --> 00:22:51.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make us happy
and draw us closer to our friends

00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:53.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and closer to Jehovah.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:56.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a recent Morning Worship program,

00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:59.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother William Turner explains
that these inner qualities

00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:02.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t just make us beautiful to Jehovah

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they also make us valuable to him.

00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:08.803 line:10% position:50% align:center
What do you think makes us valuable

00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:11.014 line:10% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah?

00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:14.809 line:10% position:50% align:center
Is it our natural ability?

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:18.813 line:10% position:50% align:center
our many years of faithful service?

00:23:18.813 --> 00:23:20.815 line:10% position:50% align:center
Is it our Bethel assignment?

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:26.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, turn with me in your Bibles
to 1 Peter chapter 3,

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:31.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll let Jehovah answer this for us
through his Word.

00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:36.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 3 and we’ll read verse 4:

00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:43.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But let it be the secret person of the heart

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:48.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the incorruptible adornment
of the quiet and mild spirit,

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:52.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is of great value in the eyes of God.”

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course,
we know in the full context

00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:58.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the opening verses
here in 1 Peter chapter 3,

00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:01.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter is referring to Christian women.

00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:05.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we isolate this phrase in verse 4,

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:09.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the secret person of the heart,”

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:13.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
that applies to all of us,
brothers and sisters,

00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:17.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’s referring to who we are
on the inside

00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:21.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our thoughts, our beliefs, our emotions.

00:24:22.837 --> 00:24:26.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why David prayed at Psalm 51:10

00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:31.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah to create within him
“a pure heart,”

00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:34.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that’s what Jehovah sees
and examines,

00:24:34.724 --> 00:24:39.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is what is valuable to him,

00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:43.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s what all of us are striving to do
—to serve him in that way.

00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:47.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the beautiful thing
is that when Jehovah sees

00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:49.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re trying to serve him this way,

00:24:49.864 --> 00:24:53.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only does that make us valuable to him

00:24:53.868 --> 00:24:57.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he will also give us whatever we need

00:24:57.747 --> 00:25:01.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
in whatever assignment we happen to have.

00:25:02.544 --> 00:25:06.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just to prove this,
let’s look at three different occasions

00:25:06.506 --> 00:25:09.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
in various stages of David’s life,

00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:14.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
all related to his assignment in warfare.

00:25:14.055 --> 00:25:18.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll start with the account
in 1 Samuel chapter 17.

00:25:20.103 --> 00:25:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was determined
that David was going to fight Goliath,

00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:28.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll recall that he was clothed
with Saul’s armor.

00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, likely that was quite the privilege

00:25:31.531 --> 00:25:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to fight with the king’s armor.

00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:37.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice the middle of verse 39.

00:25:37.496 --> 00:25:40.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
After David tries it on,
look at what happens:

00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:42.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David said to Saul:

00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:45.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am unable to go in these things,

00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:48.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I am not used to them.’

00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:51.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
So David took them off.”

00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was valuable armor,

00:25:53.887 --> 00:25:58.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
but David wasn’t equipped to use it.

00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:03.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t fit him or his circumstances
at the time.

00:26:03.522 --> 00:26:08.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you notice
David didn’t let that stop him.

00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:12.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he used what worked for him.

00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:14.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looked for five smooth stones,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with Jehovah’s help,

00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:20.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was more than enough
for him to carry out his assignment.

00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:24.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we know of brothers and sisters,

00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:27.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe here at Bethel or in the field,

00:26:27.129 --> 00:26:31.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
who at one time may have been hesitant
to have a Bible study

00:26:31.342 --> 00:26:35.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to engage
in some other aspect of the ministry,

00:26:35.346 --> 00:26:39.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe because they felt they didn’t have
the skill of a seasoned pioneer.

00:26:40.643 --> 00:26:43.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet they excelled,

00:26:43.354 --> 00:26:45.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed their efforts.

00:26:45.648 --> 00:26:48.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, they didn’t let that stop them.

00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:50.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just worked with what they had

00:26:50.486 --> 00:26:54.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their love for Jehovah, their sincerity—

00:26:54.324 --> 00:26:56.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed them.

00:26:56.868 --> 00:26:59.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is, because of our circumstances

00:26:59.746 --> 00:27:04.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may not all have
the experience, the training

00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:08.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the figurative king’s armor, so to speak—

00:27:08.004 --> 00:27:10.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a particular assignment,

00:27:10.548 --> 00:27:13.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we still should not let that stop us

00:27:13.093 --> 00:27:15.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our efforts to serve Jehovah.

00:27:15.804 --> 00:27:18.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find what works for us.

00:27:18.556 --> 00:27:23.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it may be that for a time
we may feel that we’re just working

00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:26.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a couple of figurative smooth stones.

00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah says that is more than enough

00:27:29.651 --> 00:27:32.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to carry out our assignment.

00:27:33.488 --> 00:27:36.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider the second occasion.

00:27:36.324 --> 00:27:41.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, now David is trained,
he’s skilled, and he’s quite the warrior.

00:27:41.246 --> 00:27:46.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 1 Samuel 18:4,
he gets another privilege.

00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:51.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time it’s to use
the armor of Saul’s son, Jonathan.

00:27:51.256 --> 00:27:53.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s successful.

00:27:53.258 --> 00:27:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wins many battles.

00:27:55.344 --> 00:28:00.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the point where, in verse 7,
the women are celebrating:

00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Saul has struck down his thousands,

00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:05.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David his tens of thousands.”

00:28:06.397 --> 00:28:10.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what makes David so successful?

00:28:10.234 --> 00:28:12.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
One <i>Watchtower</i>  noted

00:28:12.236 --> 00:28:15.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that David’s “fighting
was a matter of courage”

00:28:15.948 --> 00:28:19.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he “repeatedly . . .
inquired of Jehovah

00:28:19.493 --> 00:28:21.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as to his moving into battle,

00:28:21.996 --> 00:28:25.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
“showing that he was being guided
by [Jehovah]

00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:28.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not merely love of conquest.”

00:28:30.004 --> 00:28:32.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we take away from this?

00:28:33.174 --> 00:28:38.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we’re privileged
to do many things in the organization,

00:28:38.137 --> 00:28:40.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should never let our intellect,

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:45.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
our privilege, our position,
our natural abilities stop us

00:28:45.478 --> 00:28:49.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
from seeking Jehovah’s direction first.

00:28:49.482 --> 00:28:51.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can help us to maintain humility

00:28:51.985 --> 00:28:55.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to keep us valuable to Jehovah.

00:28:55.697 --> 00:28:57.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it was interesting
that <i>The Watchtower</i>  also mentioned

00:28:57.865 --> 00:29:01.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the reasons
that the women were able to sing

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and celebrate David

00:29:03.413 --> 00:29:08.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
was because of how David
inspired his men in battle.

00:29:08.418 --> 00:29:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, clearly, David must have worked well
along with others.

00:29:13.423 --> 00:29:16.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
He encouraged his men.
He motivated them.

00:29:16.134 --> 00:29:18.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brought out the best in them.

00:29:18.845 --> 00:29:21.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
And together,

00:29:21.473 --> 00:29:26.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were able to have many victories
in behalf of Jehovah.

00:29:27.437 --> 00:29:32.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, isn’t that a nice reminder
for family heads, congregation elders,

00:29:32.025 --> 00:29:35.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
our overseers and crew leaders
here at Bethel?

00:29:35.028 --> 00:29:38.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we maintain the right disposition,

00:29:38.198 --> 00:29:42.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can use us to inspire
—to motivate—

00:29:42.244 --> 00:29:45.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to encourage
those whom we work with.

00:29:45.622 --> 00:29:49.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then,
together we can accomplish much

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s praise.

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:54.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
One final occasion,

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time in 2 Samuel.

00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:02.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this point, David is now older.

00:30:02.514 --> 00:30:04.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s won many battles.

00:30:04.975 --> 00:30:09.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in yet another war with the Philistines,
notice what happens to him.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice 2 Samuel chapter 21.

00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Samuel 21, we’ll read verse 15.

00:30:23.327 --> 00:30:27.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Once again there was war
between the Philistines and Israel.

00:30:27.915 --> 00:30:31.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So David and his servants went down
and fought the Philistines,

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:35.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
but David became exhausted.”

00:30:37.174 --> 00:30:41.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time, David, even with his armor,

00:30:41.554 --> 00:30:45.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
was in a situation
that almost got him killed.

00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:48.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the courage was still there,

00:30:48.227 --> 00:30:50.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his strength wasn’t.

00:30:50.605 --> 00:30:53.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was exhausted.

00:30:53.107 --> 00:30:58.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in verse 17,
how grateful he must have been

00:30:58.029 --> 00:31:02.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
that men like Abishai
had kept an eye on him

00:31:02.575 --> 00:31:05.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and quickly came to his aid.

00:31:05.662 --> 00:31:09.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you go back a couple of chapters
to chapter 18,

00:31:09.582 --> 00:31:13.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 3 and 4,
this matter of David going out to fight

00:31:13.044 --> 00:31:15.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
had come up before.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you notice when you look at those verses,

00:31:17.424 --> 00:31:20.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was not as if the men were stopping David

00:31:20.343 --> 00:31:22.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
from doing anything.

00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:25.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just wanted him to do work

00:31:25.432 --> 00:31:28.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fit his circumstances.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 4,
we see the wisdom of David

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
in agreeing to do so.

00:31:34.858 --> 00:31:39.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t this make us think
of our dear, faithful older ones

00:31:39.237 --> 00:31:41.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the family?

00:31:41.281 --> 00:31:43.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love all of you so dearly.

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:46.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hold you in high esteem,

00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:49.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know that Jehovah treasures

00:31:49.122 --> 00:31:52.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and values you as well

00:31:52.084 --> 00:31:54.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he sees your heart.

00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:56.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he knows that your strength

00:31:56.463 --> 00:32:00.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not be as it once was,

00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:02.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
but your faith, your love,

00:32:02.886 --> 00:32:05.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
your courage, your zeal

00:32:05.848 --> 00:32:10.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s all there,
and it’s as strong as ever.

00:32:10.185 --> 00:32:15.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re so appreciative
of our brotherhood and this Bethel family,

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:17.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we have members like Abishai

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where it’s such a privilege
for them and us

00:32:21.071 --> 00:32:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to your aid
and support you when we can.

00:32:25.701 --> 00:32:29.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah certainly appreciates
your willingness to do

00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:34.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever work you’re able to do
as it fits your circumstances.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what a reminder it is to know

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:41.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s not our strength or natural ability

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
that draws us closer to Jehovah.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s that “secret person of the heart”

00:32:47.682 --> 00:32:49.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a pure heart—

00:32:49.684 --> 00:32:51.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
that makes us valuable to God.

00:32:51.978 --> 00:32:54.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we serve him in that way,

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will give us whatever we need,

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:59.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of our situation,
or circumstances,

00:32:59.527 --> 00:33:04.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always serve him
in a way that he approves.

00:33:04.991 --> 00:33:07.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Brother Turner said is true.

00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:09.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah values us

00:33:09.204 --> 00:33:12.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will give us what we need
to fulfill our commission to preach,

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:16.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we feel
we lack strength or natural abilities.

00:33:18.046 --> 00:33:20.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our music video this month is entitled

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:22.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>He Knows Us.</i>

00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reassures us
that when we are discouraged

00:33:25.428 --> 00:33:28.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
or tired or afraid,

00:33:28.098 --> 00:33:30.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows how we feel.

00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:45.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were woven
in the depths of the earth,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:51.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we even came
into this world,

00:33:52.539 --> 00:33:59.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw
right from the start

00:33:59.797 --> 00:34:05.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep down
inside our beating heart.

00:34:06.512 --> 00:34:11.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just stop and think
what that means.

00:34:11.892 --> 00:34:18.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:34:18.774 --> 00:34:25.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:34:25.614 --> 00:34:32.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:34:32.705 --> 00:34:39.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:34:39.045 --> 00:34:42.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows.

00:34:47.553 --> 00:34:54.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a father
wants his child to succeed,

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how he feels
about you and me.

00:35:01.526 --> 00:35:08.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sifts through us
and sees where we shine

00:35:08.158 --> 00:35:13.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who we can be
in Paradise.

00:35:14.873 --> 00:35:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
So always know
that he cares.

00:35:20.503 --> 00:35:27.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:35:27.552 --> 00:35:34.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:35:34.476 --> 00:35:41.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:35:41.608 --> 00:35:47.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows.

00:35:55.622 --> 00:36:04.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must look up above
and never forget about his love and pray—

00:36:04.465 --> 00:36:08.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pray.

00:36:09.219 --> 00:36:15.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell him when life is hard
and fear’s got a grip on our heart.

00:36:15.684 --> 00:36:22.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, we’re okay;
we don’t have to be afraid.

00:36:23.818 --> 00:36:30.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:36:30.783 --> 00:36:37.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:36:37.623 --> 00:36:44.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:36:44.714 --> 00:36:50.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:36:51.345 --> 00:36:58.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we feel, what we see,

00:36:58.603 --> 00:37:05.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we try hard to give our best,
The joys we feel, and our regrets.

00:37:05.068 --> 00:37:12.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead.

00:37:12.242 --> 00:37:18.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we can’t find the words to say,
we’re not alone.

00:37:18.957 --> 00:37:23.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows.

00:37:31.845 --> 00:37:33.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful!

00:37:33.263 --> 00:37:34.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you hear the line,

00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:39.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He knows you; he knows me—
What we need, what we plead”?

00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:41.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so catchy and uplifting.

00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:46.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we’ll all be singing <i>He Knows Us </i>
for days to come.

00:37:47.819 --> 00:37:50.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Discouragement can be a powerful enemy.

00:37:50.697 --> 00:37:54.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the April 22, 2001, issue of <i>Awake!,</i>

00:37:54.827 --> 00:37:59.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Janice Adams told how Jehovah
helped her overcome discouragement

00:37:59.456 --> 00:38:04.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain a positive attitude
despite many trials.

00:38:05.212 --> 00:38:07.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out how she’s doing now.

00:38:09.383 --> 00:38:13.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born deaf,
and I attended a school for the deaf.

00:38:15.097 --> 00:38:17.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, I attended college.

00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:20.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I was there,

00:38:20.394 --> 00:38:25.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that my vision was deteriorating,
and I couldn’t understand why.

00:38:25.941 --> 00:38:28.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was informed that I was going blind.

00:38:28.277 --> 00:38:30.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was stunned.

00:38:30.529 --> 00:38:32.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was also given an article,

00:38:32.698 --> 00:38:37.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the article,
I noticed one sentence that said: 

00:38:37.578 --> 00:38:41.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Deaf-blind people] are the loneliest people
in the world.”

00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:45.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was devastated.

00:38:48.798 --> 00:38:51.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being both deaf and blind is challenging.

00:38:53.845 --> 00:38:56.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had to learn how to live independently.

00:38:58.683 --> 00:39:02.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the most important thing
that I’ve learned

00:39:02.395 --> 00:39:06.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
is learning about Jehovah—the true God.

00:39:13.531 --> 00:39:15.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might imagine

00:39:15.575 --> 00:39:20.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a deaf-blind person would be too limited
to serve Jehovah fully.

00:39:20.372 --> 00:39:22.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s far from the truth.

00:39:22.832 --> 00:39:26.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me give you some examples of my service.

00:39:26.294 --> 00:39:29.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the ways
that I support the congregation

00:39:29.422 --> 00:39:32.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
are by attending meetings

00:39:32.551 --> 00:39:35.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being regular in service.

00:39:35.887 --> 00:39:37.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I can be helpful

00:39:37.931 --> 00:39:41.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
in training others how
to be more effective teachers.

00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:45.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often join others on their Bible studies.

00:39:45.647 --> 00:39:48.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been able to pioneer for many years,

00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is something that I really enjoy.

00:39:53.572 --> 00:39:55.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years, 

00:39:55.949 --> 00:40:00.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
my husband and I have had the opportunity
to preach in many countries.

00:40:00.788 --> 00:40:05.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some of the countries,
the deaf ministry was just getting started.

00:40:05.584 --> 00:40:10.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we went to Honduras in Central America.

00:40:10.381 --> 00:40:13.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
They only had two small groups.

00:40:13.842 --> 00:40:16.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
We first went for a few months,

00:40:16.512 --> 00:40:19.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
then returned and stayed for a year.

00:40:19.223 --> 00:40:23.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great experience to participate
and see the growth in the field!

00:40:25.855 --> 00:40:28.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:40:28.357 --> 00:40:31.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was accustomed
to being a self-sufficient person.

00:40:31.861 --> 00:40:36.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, I could go out on my own
with my guide dog.

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:40.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could go to the Kingdom Hall
to meet the brothers and sisters.

00:40:41.913 --> 00:40:45.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then COVID-19 hit, and I was 

00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
stuck at home—isolated.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s true that we still had meetings

00:40:54.509 --> 00:40:58.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and service arrangements on Zoom,
it wasn’t easy.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only person who could interpret for me

00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:07.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
was my husband, no one else.

00:41:07.605 --> 00:41:09.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was tough.

00:41:09.607 --> 00:41:11.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was exhausted.

00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:13.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both were.

00:41:13.653 --> 00:41:15.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was something we had to endure.

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:21.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, when it became safe enough,

00:41:21.536 --> 00:41:26.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few of the brothers and sisters volunteered
to come and help interpret.

00:41:27.334 --> 00:41:30.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really built me up.

00:41:30.253 --> 00:41:34.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could finally have direct contact
with my friends.

00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:37.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thrilled.

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also receive a lot of support
from the congregation.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:46.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many willing volunteers
to tactile interpret for me at the meetings.

00:41:46.853 --> 00:41:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gives me joy.

00:41:49.189 --> 00:41:50.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always know

00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:55.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if I have a problem, I can share
my thoughts and feelings with others.

00:41:55.445 --> 00:41:57.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will listen and support me.

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:03.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what the future brings,

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:08.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember the scripture at Isaiah 41:10.

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:10.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:42:10.711 --> 00:42:14.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.”

00:42:15.174 --> 00:42:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that Jehovah encourages me.

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help me.

00:42:20.596 --> 00:42:22.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t have to worry.

00:42:26.393 --> 00:42:31.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s true
that I’m deaf and blind, I’m not

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of “the loneliest people in the world.”

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a happy person
because I have many friends,

00:42:39.073 --> 00:42:43.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have the joy of helping others
to learn about God,

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:47.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have the best Friend ever

00:42:47.123 --> 00:42:49.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah.

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:03.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith grows strong

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:06.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we imitate the faith
of fellow Christians like Janice

00:43:06.726 --> 00:43:10.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those in the Bible who loved Jehovah.

00:43:10.104 --> 00:43:12.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we read God’s Word,
we want to visualize

00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:16.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
what life was like
for these people of faith.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to see what they saw,

00:43:19.531 --> 00:43:23.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
hear what they heard,
and feel what they felt.

00:43:23.576 --> 00:43:26.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must immerse ourselves in their stories.

00:43:26.746 --> 00:43:30.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to debut a new series

00:43:30.625 --> 00:43:34.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we hope will help you do just that.

00:43:34.337 --> 00:43:37.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the first episode of the series 

00:43:37.841 --> 00:43:40.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Imitate Their Faith.</i>

00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:49.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram, dinner is almost ready.

00:43:49.686 --> 00:43:50.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please tell Shem.

00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:52.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be right there, Mom.

00:43:52.898 --> 00:43:54.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Abram, before we go in,

00:43:54.274 --> 00:43:56.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
let me tell you the rest.

00:43:57.152 --> 00:43:59.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just a young man back then.

00:44:00.948 --> 00:44:02.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Jehovah gave my father

00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:04.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
the command to build the ark,

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
it took decades to complete.

00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we had to gather food and all the animals.

00:44:15.504 --> 00:44:18.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had no idea how long we would be inside.

00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:25.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Jehovah closed the ark’s door,

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were ready.

00:44:31.812 --> 00:44:33.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
So were you scared?

00:44:33.731 --> 00:44:36.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram, I know you’re just a boy,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
but things have happened to you

00:44:37.652 --> 00:44:38.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have scared you, right?

00:44:38.903 --> 00:44:39.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was older than you, but I was still scared.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were building the ark,

00:44:45.993 --> 00:44:48.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
people thought we were crazy.

00:44:49.288 --> 00:44:52.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, just like Jehovah said it would,

00:44:52.458 --> 00:44:54.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
it happened.

00:45:27.118 --> 00:45:29.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only eight were saved

00:45:29.537 --> 00:45:32.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my parents, my brothers, and our wives.

00:45:32.833 --> 00:45:36.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were living proof that Jehovah’s word never fails.

00:45:36.628 --> 00:45:38.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised my father

00:45:38.672 --> 00:45:41.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He would never again destroy all life

00:45:41.174 --> 00:45:43.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a global Flood.

00:45:43.218 --> 00:45:45.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to know I was scared,

00:45:45.429 --> 00:45:47.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I know to trust Jehovah.

00:45:47.764 --> 00:45:49.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah promises something

00:45:49.433 --> 00:45:51.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve never seen,

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:54.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
it takes a special quality to believe it.

00:45:54.938 --> 00:45:56.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know what that quality is?

00:45:57.691 --> 00:45:59.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faith.

00:46:19.547 --> 00:46:23.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram and Sarai lived in Ur,

00:46:23.008 --> 00:46:26.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
a city full of people who worshipped pagan gods.

00:46:28.097 --> 00:46:30.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Noah and Shem,

00:46:30.099 --> 00:46:32.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram and Sarai worshipped Jehovah.

00:46:39.108 --> 00:46:41.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram.

00:46:46.157 --> 00:46:50.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram, go out from your land

00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:53.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from your relatives

00:46:53.664 --> 00:46:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come into the land that I will show you.

00:47:33.455 --> 00:47:35.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where will we live?

00:47:36.541 --> 00:47:38.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be so far away from our family.

00:47:38.835 --> 00:47:40.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have every confidence

00:47:40.545 --> 00:47:42.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we do what Jehovah asks,

00:47:42.798 --> 00:47:44.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
things will turn out fine.

00:47:45.425 --> 00:47:46.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:47:48.428 --> 00:47:52.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever it is, I will be by your side.

00:47:52.766 --> 00:47:55.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing I wouldn’t sacrifice for Jehovah.

00:47:57.062 --> 00:47:59.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know. I know.

00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:06.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram and Sarai left Ur.

00:48:06.947 --> 00:48:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lived in Haran for some time,

00:48:09.658 --> 00:48:12.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah told Abram to keep moving.

00:48:14.371 --> 00:48:16.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living in tents was not easy,

00:48:18.334 --> 00:48:20.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the caravan gradually settled

00:48:20.127 --> 00:48:22.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a routine of travel.

00:48:28.594 --> 00:48:31.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram’s nephew Lot was like a brother to him.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as their flocks grew large,

00:48:36.727 --> 00:48:39.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
tension grew between their groups.

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:47.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, there should be

00:48:47.572 --> 00:48:49.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
no quarreling between me and you,

00:48:49.574 --> 00:48:51.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
for we are brothers.

00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:53.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is not the whole land available to you?

00:48:53.953 --> 00:48:56.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, separate from me.

00:48:56.622 --> 00:48:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you go to the left,

00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:00.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
then I will go to the right.

00:49:02.253 --> 00:49:04.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though it must have hurt their hearts,

00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:07.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
they agreed to part ways.

00:49:09.177 --> 00:49:12.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lot moved east to the district of the Jordan

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:16.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
were located.

00:49:19.104 --> 00:49:21.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Lot had gone,

00:49:21.231 --> 00:49:24.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made a promise about Abram’s future.

00:49:26.319 --> 00:49:28.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Raise your eyes, please,

00:49:28.738 --> 00:49:31.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look from the place where you are,

00:49:31.324 --> 00:49:33.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the north and south,

00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:37.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
east and west,

00:49:37.205 --> 00:49:40.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all the land that you see,

00:49:40.083 --> 00:49:42.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give to you and your offspring

00:49:42.627 --> 00:49:44.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a lasting possession.

00:49:44.755 --> 00:49:46.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will make your offspring

00:49:46.882 --> 00:49:49.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the dust particles of the earth.

00:50:32.928 --> 00:50:34.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram.

00:50:35.514 --> 00:50:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abram.

00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not fear, Abram.

00:50:40.102 --> 00:50:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am a shield for you.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your reward will be very great.

00:50:46.567 --> 00:50:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sovereign Lord Jehovah,

00:50:49.237 --> 00:50:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will you give me,

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:53.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing that I continue childless?

00:50:53.741 --> 00:50:55.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go outside.

00:50:55.493 --> 00:50:58.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look up, please,

00:50:58.413 --> 00:51:01.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the heavens and count the stars,

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:04.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you are able to do so.

00:51:07.088 --> 00:51:10.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
So your offspring will become.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Jehovah changed Abram’s name

00:51:16.222 --> 00:51:18.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Abraham,

00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:21.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “Father of a Multitude.”

00:51:21.936 --> 00:51:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also changed Sarai’s name to Sarah,

00:51:24.939 --> 00:51:27.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “Princess.”

00:51:28.818 --> 00:51:31.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day, these new names

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:33.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
would remind them of Jehovah’s promise.

00:51:38.036 --> 00:51:41.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah didn’t stop there.

00:51:42.541 --> 00:51:45.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sent three angels to reassure Abraham

00:51:45.085 --> 00:51:47.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
with even more good news.

00:51:51.633 --> 00:51:54.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within the year, he and Sarah would have a son.

00:52:03.604 --> 00:52:06.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they also brought other news.

00:52:07.608 --> 00:52:10.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through one of the angels, Jehovah said:

00:52:10.986 --> 00:52:12.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah

00:52:12.988 --> 00:52:14.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
is indeed great,

00:52:14.615 --> 00:52:16.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their sin is very heavy.

00:52:33.342 --> 00:52:35.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

00:52:36.554 --> 00:52:39.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose there are 50 righteous men within the city.

00:52:40.016 --> 00:52:42.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you, then, sweep them away

00:52:42.476 --> 00:52:44.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not pardon the place for the sake

00:52:44.312 --> 00:52:46.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 50 righteous who are inside it?

00:52:48.608 --> 00:52:50.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s unthinkable of you.

00:52:51.235 --> 00:52:53.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?

00:52:56.282 --> 00:52:59.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I find in Sodom 50 righteous men in the city,

00:52:59.827 --> 00:53:02.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will pardon the whole place for their sake.

00:53:03.539 --> 00:53:05.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, here I presume to speak to Jehovah,

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas I am dust and ashes.

00:53:09.671 --> 00:53:12.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose the 50 righteous should lack five.

00:53:13.299 --> 00:53:16.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the five will you destroy the whole city?

00:53:17.178 --> 00:53:19.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham knew that the Judge of all the earth

00:53:19.931 --> 00:53:22.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
always does what is right.

00:53:22.267 --> 00:53:25.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
But knowing and trusting

00:53:25.103 --> 00:53:26.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
are two different things.

00:53:26.771 --> 00:53:29.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not destroy it for the sake of the 20.

00:53:29.899 --> 00:53:32.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, please, do not become hot with anger,

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:34.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let me speak just once more:

00:53:34.779 --> 00:53:37.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose only ten are found there.

00:53:40.368 --> 00:53:42.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.

00:53:52.464 --> 00:53:56.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have seen in my life that everything

00:53:56.176 --> 00:53:59.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah promises always comes true.

00:54:00.013 --> 00:54:03.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout your life have full confidence

00:54:03.183 --> 00:54:06.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will always do what is right.

00:54:16.405 --> 00:54:20.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to see Part 2
of the story of Abraham?

00:54:21.076 --> 00:54:22.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too!

00:54:22.536 --> 00:54:25.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have to wait till next month,

00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:27.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
so be sure to tune in.

00:54:28.918 --> 00:54:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Imitate Their Faith</i>
has been a beloved series

00:54:33.089 --> 00:54:37.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the <i>Watchtower</i>  magazine
since 2008.

00:54:37.176 --> 00:54:41.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more recently,
it’s been online at jw.org.

00:54:42.682 --> 00:54:47.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note this excerpt
from the introduction to the printed edition:

00:54:48.604 --> 00:54:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are they that real to you?

00:54:51.607 --> 00:54:56.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imagine what it would be like
to walk and talk with them,

00:54:56.571 --> 00:54:59.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to spend time getting to know

00:54:59.115 --> 00:55:03.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“such men and women
as Noah, Abraham, Ruth,

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Elijah, and Esther.

00:55:06.706 --> 00:55:10.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Think of the influence
they might have on your life

00:55:10.752 --> 00:55:14.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the precious words of advice
and encouragement

00:55:14.672 --> 00:55:16.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might offer!”

00:55:17.175 --> 00:55:20.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s our earnest prayer
that you’ll use this new series

00:55:20.595 --> 00:55:25.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a faith that’s equal
to any test that comes your way.

00:55:28.019 --> 00:55:31.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve enjoyed a delightful program.

00:55:31.439 --> 00:55:36.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned that Jehovah’s love
is not based on appearance or imperfection.

00:55:37.153 --> 00:55:41.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we serve him as best we can,
we are beautiful in his eyes.

00:55:42.742 --> 00:55:46.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our <i>My Teen Life</i>  segment reminded us

00:55:46.538 --> 00:55:49.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
that striving
for the world’s beauty standards

00:55:49.916 --> 00:55:53.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
can rob us of our self-esteem,

00:55:53.003 --> 00:55:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
but building
the inner qualities Jehovah values

00:55:56.173 --> 00:55:59.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make us truly happy.

00:55:59.801 --> 00:56:02.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our music video reassured us

00:56:02.554 --> 00:56:06.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
that through hard times and hard feelings,

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:10.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah understands us

00:56:10.062 --> 00:56:12.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and knows what we need.

00:56:14.024 --> 00:56:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Herd,

00:56:16.026 --> 00:56:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and please thank the Governing Body

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
for providing
the new <i>Imitate Their Faith</i>  series.

00:56:24.159 --> 00:56:27.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our video postcard this month
comes from a land

00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:30.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
of sweeping vistas and dramatic scenery

00:56:30.666 --> 00:56:32.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Japan.

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Japan’s largest island of Honshu,

00:56:35.796 --> 00:56:37.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find the Tohoku region,

00:56:37.882 --> 00:56:40.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
renowned for its hot springs,

00:56:40.051 --> 00:56:43.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
cold and snowy winters,

00:56:43.512 --> 00:56:46.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
delicious rice, and fresh seafood.

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:51.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Facing the Pacific Ocean
is the stunning Sanriku Coast,

00:56:51.312 --> 00:56:53.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
with over 250 kilometers (155 mi)

00:56:53.773 --> 00:56:55.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
of zigzagging granite cliffs

00:56:55.942 --> 00:56:58.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some rising 200 meters (656 ft)
out of the sea.

00:56:59.529 --> 00:57:02.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tourists can ride the Sanriku Railway
along the coast

00:57:02.782 --> 00:57:04.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see the spectacular views.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who want to stretch their legs

00:57:07.996 --> 00:57:10.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate the natural splendor on foot

00:57:10.665 --> 00:57:15.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
can walk the more than 1,000-kilometer
(621 mi) Michinoku Coastal Trail,

00:57:15.587 --> 00:57:18.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
which stretches from Aomori Prefecture

00:57:18.173 --> 00:57:20.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Fukushima Prefecture.

00:57:21.426 --> 00:57:23.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fukushima was the site

00:57:23.511 --> 00:57:27.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a nuclear disaster that followed
the terrible earthquake and tsunami

00:57:27.223 --> 00:57:29.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
in March of 2011.

00:57:29.768 --> 00:57:34.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thousands lost their loved ones,
homes, their livelihood.

00:57:34.397 --> 00:57:36.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
The devastation
was felt throughout the country.

00:57:36.983 --> 00:57:39.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
One hundred and fifty-five congregations

00:57:39.945 --> 00:57:42.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in the area affected by the tsunami.

00:57:42.989 --> 00:57:45.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the difficult conditions,

00:57:45.033 --> 00:57:48.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
277 elders moved in

00:57:48.245 --> 00:57:52.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
to comfort and assist the congregations.

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:55.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Japanese brothers and sisters
wanted to comfort others

00:57:55.419 --> 00:57:58.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were eager to resume
organized preaching.

00:57:58.755 --> 00:58:00.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within a month,
publishers were sharing

00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:02.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible’s message of hope
with their neighbors.

00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:06.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
As they went out,
they contacted many inactive ones

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have since resumed associating
with the congregation.

00:58:11.602 --> 00:58:13.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twelve years later,

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:16.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people continue searching
for sheeplike ones.

00:58:16.774 --> 00:58:19.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s visit three congregations

00:58:19.568 --> 00:58:21.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Sanriku area.

00:58:21.612 --> 00:58:25.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
These congregations,
each with fewer than 60 publishers,

00:58:25.199 --> 00:58:28.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
still deliver a mighty shout of praise.

00:58:28.702 --> 00:58:31.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tsunami and resulting disaster

00:58:31.247 --> 00:58:34.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a big effect on those in the territory.

00:58:34.375 --> 00:58:35.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many began to realize

00:58:35.793 --> 00:58:39.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
that spiritual things are more important

00:58:39.672 --> 00:58:41.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
than what we can see.

00:58:41.674 --> 00:58:43.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers have done their best

00:58:43.801 --> 00:58:46.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fill the void that many are feeling

00:58:46.971 --> 00:58:49.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Bible’s message of hope.

00:58:50.474 --> 00:58:53.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the 2011 disaster,

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:56.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
20 Bible students
have dedicated themselves to Jehovah

00:58:56.439 --> 00:58:58.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have gotten baptized.

00:58:59.192 --> 00:59:03.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kamaishi, Ofunato,
and Rikuzentakata congregations

00:59:03.863 --> 00:59:06.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their Christian love and affection.

00:59:07.784 --> 00:59:11.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
