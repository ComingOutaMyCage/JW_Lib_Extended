00:00:01.647 --> 00:00:06.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®
for June 2023!

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
Over the past few years,

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.842 line:10% position:50% align:center
because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.677 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Gilead classes were limited

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:33.888 line:10% position:50% align:center
to 24 students.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:38.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now on the 80th anniversary of the school,

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:42.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
48 special full-time servants
from around the world

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:45.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
were once again together in one class!

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:50.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 11, a program
of specifically crafted talks

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:54.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
was presented
as a parting gift to the graduates.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s our pleasure
to share these talks with you.

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:00.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is Part 1

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:03.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 153rd Gilead graduation program.

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:09.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, would some power the gift give us

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:14.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to see ourselves as others see us!

00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:18.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would from many a blunder free us.”

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that famous quote
from the Scottish poet Robert Burns

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:27.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
acknowledges that it is impossible

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:32.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always see ourselves as others do.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s why we need training.

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:36.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need advice.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:40.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need counsel
to help us to improve

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to work on certain flaws

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:47.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps we just can’t see in ourselves.

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:52.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what a wonderful opportunity
you students at Gilead have had

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:57.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive focused spiritual training

00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:01.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
from brothers who truly love you!

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:06.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, no doubt you’ve come
to see yourself more clearly

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you have ever seen yourself before.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, that quote from Robert Burns

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be understood in a different way too.

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:21.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, maybe what we
cannot see clearly in ourselves

00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all of the good qualities that we possess

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:28.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the potential that we have

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:32.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be used by Jehovah in his service.

00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:35.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Samuel 16:7 says:

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:43.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in seeing into your heart,

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:48.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw fit to draw you

00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:51.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a dedicated relationship with him.

00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:54.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since then, he’s entrusted you

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:56.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
with various assignments in his service.

00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why?
Why did Jehovah do that?

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does he see in you?

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
What qualities
and what spiritual qualifications

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
does he observe?

00:03:08.503 --> 00:03:13.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can’t know
all that Jehovah sees in you

00:03:13.174 --> 00:03:18.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we cannot see ourselves
as Jehovah sees us.

00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:22.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s probably why
so many of God’s servants in Bible times

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:27.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
were reluctant
to accept challenging assignments.

00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:31.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just think of some examples of this

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:36.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
—people who did not see
the fine qualities in themselves

00:03:36.156 --> 00:03:38.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah could see.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, take Gideon.

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:43.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in Judges chapter 6, let’s look at this.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Judges 6:14,

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:52.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Jehovah said to Gideon.

00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:56.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Go with the strength you have,

00:03:56.426 --> 00:04:00.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will save Israel
out of Midian’s hand.

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it not I who send you?”

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:04.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how did Gideon react?

00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:08.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 15, Gideon said:

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:11.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pardon me, Jehovah.
How can I save Israel?

00:04:11.692 --> 00:04:14.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look!
My clan is the least in Manasseh,

00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:19.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am the most insignificant
in my father’s house.”

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:23.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously, Gideon

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:27.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not see himself as Jehovah saw him.

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:29.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Moses?

00:04:29.377 --> 00:04:31.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Exodus chapter 4,

00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:34.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah assigned him
to lead Israel out of Egypt,

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:39.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses was keenly aware
of all of his inadequacies.

00:04:39.053 --> 00:04:41.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when talking with Jehovah,

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
he raised one objection after another.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was Jehovah aware
of the inadequacies that Moses had?

00:04:50.314 --> 00:04:53.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course!
Of course he was!

00:04:53.568 --> 00:04:56.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also knew
that Moses’ brother, Aaron, was older

00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:58.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was a better speaker.

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:05.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah saw in Moses qualities of faith,

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:08.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
unselfishness, and meekness

00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:11.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities that made Moses

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right choice for the job.

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Jeremiah?

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah commissioned him to serve
as a prophet, do you remember what he said?

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:22.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at it.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 1

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jeremiah chapter 1—

00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:30.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look at verse 6.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah says:

00:05:33.108 --> 00:05:35.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not know how to speak,
for I am just a boy.”

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Jehovah say?

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh. OK. OK, Jeremiah,
I’ll see if I can find someone else.’

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 7:

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:54.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah then said to me:
‘Do not say, “I am just a boy.”

00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For you must go to all those
to whom I send you,

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:02.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you should say everything
that I command you.’”

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Jehovah so confident

00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:11.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jeremiah was the right choice
for this special assignment?

00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:13.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, if you look in verse 8,

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said: “I am with you.”

00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, that’s the same thing
that Jehovah said to Gideon;

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:22.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s the same thing he said to Moses.

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:25.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
because Jehovah was with them,

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be successful.

00:06:27.872 --> 00:06:29.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s another reason too.

00:06:29.707 --> 00:06:31.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see what it says in verse 5?

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said to Jeremiah:

00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:38.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before I formed you in the womb

00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:43.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I knew [isn’t that interesting? I knew] you,

00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:46.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and before you were born I sanctified you.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made you a prophet to the nations.”

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:53.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew Jeremiah.

00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:55.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw in Jeremiah certain qualities

00:06:55.942 --> 00:07:00.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would make him an effective prophet
with Jehovah’s help.

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:04.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, could Jeremiah see that in himself?

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:06.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:09.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just had to trust in Jehovah’s assessment,

00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:14.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
move forward,
and do what Jehovah asked him to do.

00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:19.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have wonderful examples of this
in our modern day too.

00:07:19.132 --> 00:07:23.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother John Booth
was a faithful, humble brother.

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
He started in full-time service in 1928.

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 1935,

00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:34.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was called to work
at the factory at Bethel.

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, just after working for a few days,

00:07:37.317 --> 00:07:41.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was very surprised
when Brother Knorr invited him

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:44.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go on the road
as a regional service director,

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we would perhaps call
a circuit overseer today.

00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:51.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr explained
there was a great need

00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:53.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Brother Booth could be a big help

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his experience as a pioneer.

00:07:57.754 --> 00:07:59.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Brother Booth replied

00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:02.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had never had
a position in the congregation.

00:08:02.884 --> 00:08:06.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had never given a talk.
Can you imagine?

00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:09.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had no training to do so.

00:08:09.308 --> 00:08:11.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s what Brother Knorr said:

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:16.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Eloquent speakers are not what is needed,

00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:20.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just someone who loves the service
and will take the lead in it

00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:25.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will talk about service at the meetings.”

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:30.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Booth said:
“With misgivings, doubts, and fears,

00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:35.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wanting to do Jehovah’s will,
I agreed to try it.”

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:37.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did it turn out?

00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:39.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Booth moved forward.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spent his whole life in full-time service,

00:08:43.217 --> 00:08:46.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
later serving for more than 20 years

00:08:46.637 --> 00:08:49.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a member of the Governing Body.

00:08:49.014 --> 00:08:51.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he finished his earthly course,

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:53.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> stated:

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[He] was beloved
for his profoundly humble

00:08:57.315 --> 00:09:00.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind Christian personality.”

00:09:01.027 --> 00:09:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, Jehovah saw something good

00:09:05.615 --> 00:09:08.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Brother John Booth.

00:09:08.034 --> 00:09:10.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from these examples?

00:09:10.828 --> 00:09:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Gideon and Moses
and Jeremiah and Brother Booth,

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:19.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might feel inadequate 
for certain assignments.

00:09:19.587 --> 00:09:24.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s good that we’re not overconfident
or too self-reliant.

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:28.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we don’t want to go
to the other extreme either.

00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:30.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you see, we could begin to think:

00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:35.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I could never be a pioneer.
I could never be a ministerial servant.

00:09:35.103 --> 00:09:38.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I could never be an elder.
I could never be a Bethelite.

00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:43.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could never be a construction servant,’
and on and on and on.

00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:46.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re given one of those assignments
or some other one,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could even hesitate to accept

00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:51.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
—give in to fear.

00:09:51.703 --> 00:09:56.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact is that we
cannot fully see ourselves

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah does.

00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:02.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much better to make ourselves available

00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:06.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then move forward with the work
that we’re given to do,

00:10:06.551 --> 00:10:11.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking to Jehovah to make up 
for whatever we may lack!

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:15.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, you students,
who are soon-to-be graduates,

00:10:15.978 --> 00:10:19.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
will no doubt have a variety of assignments

00:10:19.314 --> 00:10:21.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the coming years.

00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:23.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever those assignments are,

00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:28.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
move forward with full confidence in Jehovah.

00:10:28.407 --> 00:10:30.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be with you.

00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:34.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll give you everything that you need
to be successful

00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:36.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
in accomplishing the work.

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:39.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the question:

00:10:39.627 --> 00:10:43.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?

00:10:43.213 --> 00:10:48.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps to some extent, yes,
but not completely.

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be ready to listen to counsel

00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:54.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to make adjustments.

00:10:54.683 --> 00:10:58.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
But also, when your good qualities

00:10:58.646 --> 00:11:01.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your good potential are noticed

00:11:01.232 --> 00:11:04.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you receive new assignments,

00:11:04.485 --> 00:11:09.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
grab hold and move forward.

00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:12.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may our wonderful God, Jehovah,

00:11:12.368 --> 00:11:16.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
always be with you
and bless you as you do so.

00:11:25.048 --> 00:11:26.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we’re looking forward
to the first talk

00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Gilead graduation program.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to be from a member
of the United States Branch Committee,

00:11:32.513 --> 00:11:36.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Jesse Morris, and his theme is
“What Will You Be Called?”

00:11:51.324 --> 00:11:55.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest honor anyone can have

00:11:55.996 --> 00:11:59.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to be called a servant
of the Most High God, Jehovah.

00:12:01.209 --> 00:12:05.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you’ve seen
from your deep study of God’s Word,

00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:10.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
servants of Jehovah also have
distinct personality traits, or qualities,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are called to mind
when their names are mentioned.

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:17.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, what qualities, or traits,

00:12:17.684 --> 00:12:21.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you think of
when we mention the following names?

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:27.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ruth, Gideon,

00:12:27.152 --> 00:12:31.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
David, Martha

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, the name of a servant of Jehovah

00:12:34.827 --> 00:12:38.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
can call to mind
certain qualities, certain traits,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are worthy of imitation.

00:12:42.042 --> 00:12:46.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will you be called?

00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:48.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you begin your new assignment,

00:12:48.549 --> 00:12:53.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
what quality, or trait, would you like
your fellow workers to think about

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
when your name is mentioned?

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Proverbs provides

00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:02.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
a very reachable goal in this regard.

00:13:02.062 --> 00:13:06.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open to Proverbs chapter 16,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read together verse 21.

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:12.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Proverbs 16:21:

00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:19.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wise in heart
will be called understanding.”

00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:23.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a worthy goal that is

00:13:23.084 --> 00:13:25.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be called a person of understanding!

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, from your studies,
you know understanding

00:13:28.714 --> 00:13:31.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the ability to put the facts together

00:13:31.175 --> 00:13:34.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to grasp the full,
complete picture of a matter.

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:38.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how is understanding demonstrated?

00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it revealed in a test score?

00:13:42.145 --> 00:13:47.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it revealed
by being the first to provide a solution

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a group setting or perhaps at a meeting?

00:13:51.654 --> 00:13:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s keep reading verse 21:

00:13:55.074 --> 00:14:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the one kind in speech
adds persuasiveness.”

00:14:01.456 --> 00:14:05.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s how understanding is demonstrated:

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
in kind speech or, as the footnote indicates,

00:14:08.922 --> 00:14:12.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“appealing speech,” “sweetness of lips.”

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:18.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a person who’s called understanding
puts the facts together,

00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
grasps the full picture

00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:24.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to find good in a matter.

00:14:24.146 --> 00:14:27.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is reflected through kind,

00:14:27.107 --> 00:14:30.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
positive, persuasive speech.

00:14:30.861 --> 00:14:34.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is more than just being optimistic

00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:37.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the power of positive thinking.

00:14:37.784 --> 00:14:40.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding has a source.

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Proverbs,
this time chapter 9,

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:46.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verse 10.

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:48.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Proverbs 9:10:

00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:53.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fear of Jehovah
is the beginning of wisdom,

00:14:53.717 --> 00:14:58.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
and knowledge of the Most Holy One
is understanding.”

00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is the Source

00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:05.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“the Most Holy One,” Jehovah God.

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:08.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s both the Source of understanding,

00:15:08.232 --> 00:15:12.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s the supreme example
in how to use it.

00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:17.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think for a moment
of what happened after the tragic,

00:15:17.408 --> 00:15:20.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
painful rebellion in the garden of Eden.

00:15:20.327 --> 00:15:22.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:26.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately, he put the facts together;
he saw the complete picture.

00:15:27.043 --> 00:15:29.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he uttered the Edenic promise

00:15:29.754 --> 00:15:33.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a positive promise—
that gives us hope,

00:15:33.174 --> 00:15:36.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
even right after that painful tragedy.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:41.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
And hundreds of years later
with the nation of Israel,

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:44.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would repeatedly abandon Jehovah.

00:15:44.685 --> 00:15:46.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would he do?

00:15:46.896 --> 00:15:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would hear their groanings,

00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:52.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would hear their cries,
he would see their changed attitude,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would raise up judges

00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:58.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save them time after time.

00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:00.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah God shows us

00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:03.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
what real understanding is.

00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because we trust in him,

00:16:06.082 --> 00:16:08.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
we too can find the good,

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:12.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
speak and act kindly and positively.

00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:16.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how refreshing it is
to see this in your class!

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:20.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your kind, positive speech and actions
with one another

00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:23.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with those that you come in contact with

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been very refreshing to see.

00:16:25.644 --> 00:16:29.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a result
of your deep trust in God’s Word

00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:32.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your deep trust in Jehovah himself.

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:35.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
And your studies
have just further enhanced that

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:37.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
over these past few months.

00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:40.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, much of the world’s education

00:16:40.742 --> 00:16:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
fosters critical thinking.

00:16:43.412 --> 00:16:45.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what <i>The Watchtower </i> says about this:

00:16:45.998 --> 00:16:49.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be fooled by the mistaken notion

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:53.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that a cynical, critical,
pessimistic attitude

00:16:53.463 --> 00:16:55.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the same as intelligence.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, negative thinking
demands little of the intellect.”

00:17:02.848 --> 00:17:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what a privilege to know,
as you dear students do,

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:08.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
what real understanding is!

00:17:08.687 --> 00:17:12.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not just the ability
to identify what’s wrong with a situation.

00:17:12.024 --> 00:17:17.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the ability
to identify how good can address it.

00:17:17.071 --> 00:17:20.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this will encourage
your brothers and sisters.

00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Bethel family member
observed understanding

00:17:24.453 --> 00:17:27.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the assistant overseer of a department.

00:17:27.206 --> 00:17:29.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion, the department overseer

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:31.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
scheduled a meeting with several brothers

00:17:31.711 --> 00:17:34.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other departments,
but he forgot to inform his assistant.

00:17:36.132 --> 00:17:40.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then on the day of the meeting,
the overseer was away.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
So several brothers arrived for a meeting

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the assistant knew nothing about.

00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:49.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would he do?

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:52.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was observed
that he said a brief, silent prayer;

00:17:52.732 --> 00:17:55.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
came out;
welcomed the group;

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
addressed the points for discussion;
and at the end said:

00:17:57.904 --> 00:18:00.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you brothers
for coming to this meeting

00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and allowing me to fill in for the overseer.

00:18:02.825 --> 00:18:05.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ll update him when he returns.”

00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just covered for him
—beautiful example.

00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:10.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew this man
had shouldered responsibility for decades.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not his pattern.

00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:14.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he just applied the good.

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:16.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed understanding.

00:18:16.673 --> 00:18:21.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, realistically,
there will be days when it will be hard

00:18:21.428 --> 00:18:24.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be known as a person of understanding.

00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:27.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if, though,
there’s a prolonged period of time

00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:31.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we’re finding it
difficult to find the good,

00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:35.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak and act kindly and positively?

00:18:35.942 --> 00:18:39.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe our mate or a trusted friend
even speaks with us and says,

00:18:39.821 --> 00:18:44.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your kind, positive speech
and actions are changing.”

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do?

00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:52.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, each person and their relationship
with Jehovah is unique.

00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:56.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s consider the example
of the writer of Psalm 73

00:18:56.505 --> 00:18:59.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learn a valuable principle.

00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:02.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer of this inspired psalm
was struggling

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
with even whether or not to serve Jehovah.

00:19:04.429 --> 00:19:06.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the turmoil he’s in

00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:10.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 73:14:

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I was troubled all day long;

00:19:16.108 --> 00:19:19.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
every morning I was chastised.”

00:19:20.613 --> 00:19:22.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it can be difficult

00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:26.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be known as a person of understanding
when we’re in this frame of mind.

00:19:26.577 --> 00:19:30.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in verse 22,
the psalmist honestly admits:

00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:34.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was unreasoning and lacked understanding.”

00:19:34.335 --> 00:19:36.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would he do?

00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:40.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could he ever be called understanding again?

00:19:41.258 --> 00:19:43.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 15:

00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:47.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But if I had said these things,

00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:49.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would have betrayed your people.”

00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:52.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first, the psalmist held back

00:19:52.854 --> 00:19:55.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
from making his perplexing thoughts public.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that that kind of negative speech
would affect God’s people.

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:02.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
He likened it to a betrayal,

00:20:02.238 --> 00:20:06.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if he were releasing the names
of his fellow worshippers to the enemy.

00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:10.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he likened negative speech to.

00:20:10.538 --> 00:20:14.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he kept
to his spiritual routine and waited.

00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then a powerful moment
took place in verse 26:

00:20:24.093 --> 00:20:27.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My body and my heart may fail,

00:20:27.388 --> 00:20:31.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but God is the rock of my heart

00:20:31.393 --> 00:20:34.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my portion forever.”

00:20:36.022 --> 00:20:39.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is—understanding.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist knew he was not alone.

00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:47.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God, the immovable Rock,

00:20:47.784 --> 00:20:52.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
was keeping him stable
in the midst of this violent windstorm

00:20:52.622 --> 00:20:55.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he found himself in.

00:20:55.625 --> 00:21:00.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
That powerful realization plugged him back
into the Source of understanding,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was once again able
to put the facts together,

00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
find good in a matter,

00:21:06.428 --> 00:21:11.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speak and act kindly and positively.

00:21:11.266 --> 00:21:13.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:21:13.977 --> 00:21:17.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are in turmoil
and feel lacking in understanding,

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are in good company.

00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:23.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many faithful servants of Jehovah
have felt this way.

00:21:23.821 --> 00:21:26.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do like the psalmist,

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:31.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hold back from negative speech,
which can affect those around us.

00:21:31.954 --> 00:21:35.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we speak privately
with a trusted friend,

00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:38.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
we keep to our spiritual routine,
and we wait.

00:21:40.087 --> 00:21:43.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wait for our powerful moment

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:47.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the realization that Jehovah God

00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:49.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the Rock of our heart.

00:21:51.098 --> 00:21:55.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one final point:
Demonstrating understanding

00:21:55.978 --> 00:21:59.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
includes demonstrating it with ourself.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will make mistakes, and when you do,

00:22:03.361 --> 00:22:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
your trust in Jehovah

00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:09.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
will allow you to find the good in yourself,

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Brother Sanderson mentioned
in the opening comments.

00:22:12.912 --> 00:22:17.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that will help you
to keep a positive frame of mind.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know Jehovah God
is going to be with you in your assignments.

00:22:21.754 --> 00:22:25.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
May your trust in him
—the Source of understanding—

00:22:25.216 --> 00:22:27.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to deepen.

00:22:27.468 --> 00:22:32.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will allow you to address situations
by putting the facts together,

00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
finding good in a matter,

00:22:34.517 --> 00:22:39.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speaking and acting kindly,
positively, persuasively.

00:22:39.189 --> 00:22:43.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you do this,
you’ll be showing that you are wise in heart

00:22:43.651 --> 00:22:47.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will be called understanding.

00:22:59.584 --> 00:23:01.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank you so much, Brother Morris,

00:23:01.586 --> 00:23:04.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that very, very encouraging talk.

00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:08.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we’re interested to hear
from a helper with the Writing Committee,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Nicholas Ahladis.

00:23:10.303 --> 00:23:14.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
His theme for us today is “There Is a River.”

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:20.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, earthquakes
have been in the news quite a bit recently.

00:23:20.439 --> 00:23:24.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re going to read
about an earthquake in Psalm 46,

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:29.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
which describes one
that has never happened in recorded history

00:23:30.824 --> 00:23:34.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 46, starting with verse 1.

00:23:37.915 --> 00:23:41.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says there:
“God is our refuge and strength,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a help that is readily found
in times of distress.

00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:50.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why we will not fear,
though the earth undergoes change

00:23:50.219 --> 00:23:54.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or, some translations say,
“though the earth quakes”],

00:23:54.098 --> 00:23:58.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“though the mountains topple
into the depths of the sea,

00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:01.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“though its waters roar and foam over,

00:24:01.272 --> 00:24:05.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
though the mountains rock
on account of its turbulence.”

00:24:06.152 --> 00:24:09.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s no evidence
that this poetic description

00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
of mountains toppling into the sea

00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally happened in ancient Israel.

00:24:15.077 --> 00:24:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
But clearly the world around the psalmist

00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:20.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
seemed to be collapsing somehow.

00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:24.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
What catastrophic situation
is being referred to?

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i>
has explained that this psalm

00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:30.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to fit the time of King Hezekiah

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:34.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jerusalem
was being threatened by Sennacherib,

00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:36.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king of Assyria.

00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know those threats were not empty.

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sennacherib had conquered
surrounding nations.

00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:47.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had also conquered
the fortified cities around Jerusalem

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:49.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were protecting the city.

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:53.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’d actually overrun the villages
right up to Nob,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Nob was within sight of Jerusalem
—one mile (1.5 km) away.

00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:03.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, as you know,
Assyria was famous for its cruelty.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:08.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve found palace walls
from Sennacherib’s time

00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:11.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
that show shocking scenes of brutality

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward conquered peoples.

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:15.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can understand why

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:18.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
the psalmist felt the world was collapsing.

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:21.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
The description is so ominous and bleak.

00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:25.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suddenly, in verse 4,

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:28.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tone of the psalm changes completely.

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is a river the streams of which

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:35.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“make the city of God rejoice,

00:25:35.117 --> 00:25:38.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the holy grand tabernacle of the Most High.

00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:42.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is in the city; it cannot be overthrown.

00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:46.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
God will come to its aid
at the break of dawn.”

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:50.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the psalmist’s thoughts
go from catastrophe and chaos

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:53.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
to peace and confidence.

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:57.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 4 speaks
about “a river” in “the city of God.”

00:25:57.723 --> 00:26:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no river flowing in Jerusalem.

00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:02.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is this referring to?

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:06.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, some suggest that it refers
to Hezekiah’s Tunnel,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was built
in order to bring water into the city.

00:26:10.361 --> 00:26:13.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the poetic structure of the psalm

00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:15.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually parallels the river

00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:18.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the holy tabernacle of Jehovah

00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:23.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the holy tabernacle of the Most High—
and the pure worship carried on there.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s interesting that when Hezekiah

00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:29.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
received the threats from Sennacherib,

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:32.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Scriptures say in 2 Kings 19

00:26:32.842 --> 00:26:36.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Hezekiah
took the letters from the Assyrians,

00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:40.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
he went into the temple,
he spread them out before Jehovah,

00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:42.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he prayed fervently.

00:26:42.977 --> 00:26:47.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Jehovah
sent a reassuring message through Isaiah:

00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:52.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have heard your prayer to me
concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria. . . .

00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:54.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will not come into [the] city

00:26:54.322 --> 00:26:56.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or shoot an arrow there or [bring] a shield

00:26:56.908 --> 00:26:59.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
or . . . siege rampart against it.”

00:27:00.495 --> 00:27:03.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the sons of Korah,
who recorded this psalm,

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:07.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have seen Hezekiah going into the temple

00:27:07.085 --> 00:27:10.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then heard
Jehovah’s response through Isaiah.

00:27:10.922 --> 00:27:15.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this would give them
complete confidence in the outcome.

00:27:15.427 --> 00:27:17.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all know what happened next.

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:19.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
The huge Assyrian army

00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:23.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
was vanquished overnight by an angel.

00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:25.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it could be that verse 5 alludes to this,

00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:30.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says: “God will come to its aid
at the break of dawn.”

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does this psalm teach us?

00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:36.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the psalmist’s example

00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:39.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
of focusing on pure worship and His Word,

00:27:39.618 --> 00:27:42.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is likened to a river in this psalm,

00:27:42.454 --> 00:27:45.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows that we can experience peace

00:27:45.082 --> 00:27:48.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when the world around us
seems to be collapsing.

00:27:49.253 --> 00:27:53.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist declared: “God is in the city.”

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was its Ruler—not Sennacherib!

00:27:56.135 --> 00:27:58.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades, Judah had been wayward

00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:01.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and God was not in Jerusalem.

00:28:01.557 --> 00:28:03.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Hezekiah renovated the temple

00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:07.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restored pure worship there.

00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:10.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
That pure worship
was like a river of blessing

00:28:10.191 --> 00:28:12.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
that connected the people to Jehovah

00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:16.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave powerful evidence
that God was in the city.

00:28:17.948 --> 00:28:21.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our <i>Pure Worship</i>  book
associates the river of Psalm 46

00:28:21.911 --> 00:28:23.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the river that flowed

00:28:23.913 --> 00:28:27.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s sanctuary in Ezekiel’s vision.

00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:29.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you might recall that that river

00:28:29.835 --> 00:28:34.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
became wider and deeper
the further it flowed.

00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:36.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Pure Worship</i>  book says about it:

00:28:36.884 --> 00:28:40.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like the visionary river that Ezekiel saw,

00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:44.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
the flow of pure truths
has expanded rapidly.”

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:47.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today the flow of that river
includes Bibles,

00:28:47.812 --> 00:28:50.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible-based publications, and videos

00:28:50.648 --> 00:28:53.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
in over a thousand languages.

00:28:53.526 --> 00:28:56.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezekiel said that the river got so deep

00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:58.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a person had to swim.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the last five months,

00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:04.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
you students have felt like Ezekiel.

00:29:04.078 --> 00:29:08.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your course has immersed you
and sometimes taken you underwater.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was
from the flood of Bible knowledge

00:29:14.297 --> 00:29:17.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
you received
through your study, your lectures,

00:29:17.258 --> 00:29:19.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also the interaction

00:29:19.511 --> 00:29:23.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the students and your instructors.

00:29:23.265 --> 00:29:27.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you may have felt
like you were even drowning sometimes.

00:29:27.018 --> 00:29:29.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Hezekiah and those with him,

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve also been
in the confines of a secure city

00:29:34.109 --> 00:29:37.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s worship prevails.

00:29:37.487 --> 00:29:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
During these months,
the world has been dealing

00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:44.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the aftermath of the pandemic
and wars and other disasters.

00:29:44.786 --> 00:29:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you were like the psalmist:

00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:50.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
The earth could quake,
the mountains could topple;

00:29:50.584 --> 00:29:53.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you enjoyed a special period of peace

00:29:53.003 --> 00:29:55.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you were focused on that river.

00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:00.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re going back out into the trenches

00:30:00.344 --> 00:30:02.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the rest of us, so to speak.

00:30:02.679 --> 00:30:07.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you will serve
where there’s economic turmoil

00:30:07.434 --> 00:30:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
or violence or other disasters,

00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:14.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you may personally face health trials,
even persecution.

00:30:14.858 --> 00:30:18.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the lesson of Gilead
and the lesson of Psalm 46

00:30:18.863 --> 00:30:20.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
can serve you well.

00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:25.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you stay focused on “the river,”
Jehovah’s pure worship,

00:30:25.244 --> 00:30:28.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can remain confident and joyful

00:30:28.581 --> 00:30:31.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of what challenges life brings.

00:30:32.793 --> 00:30:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
An ancient Greek writer said:

00:30:34.837 --> 00:30:38.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No man ever steps in the same river twice.

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:43.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
For it’s not the same river,
and he’s not the same man.”

00:30:43.054 --> 00:30:46.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it true that our lives
are constantly changing

00:30:46.307 --> 00:30:50.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and new challenges suddenly crop up?

00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:52.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s river of blessings

00:30:52.647 --> 00:30:55.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
just keeps flowing and is constantly renewed.

00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:57.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It supplies life-giving water

00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:00.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all circumstances.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:04.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is so even when
the figurative mountains of this world

00:31:04.284 --> 00:31:07.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
are toppling and the world is in chaos.

00:31:08.788 --> 00:31:12.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister in the war zone
in eastern Ukraine wrote:

00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:16.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What we needed most was spiritual food.

00:31:16.963 --> 00:31:21.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were overwhelmed with joy
when we received the JW Boxes

00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:23.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(after the Internet failed)
and spiritual food

00:31:23.928 --> 00:31:26.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
“became available again.

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:29.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Despite many challenges and difficulties,

00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:31.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when we meet with fellow believers,

00:31:31.353 --> 00:31:35.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our problems
are not the main subject of discussion.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:39.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“More often, we share
how Jehovah supports us,

00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:43.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
what has strengthened us,
and what we’re thankful for.”

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can sense her calmness.

00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:48.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
These friends are living examples

00:31:48.203 --> 00:31:50.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how focusing on “the river”

00:31:50.455 --> 00:31:55.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
can preserve our peace
even in times of disaster.

00:31:56.587 --> 00:31:59.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, returning to Psalm 46,

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can paraphrase verses 8 and 9,

00:32:02.342 --> 00:32:05.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
which may have occurred when the angel

00:32:05.137 --> 00:32:08.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
destroyed the Assyrian army.

00:32:08.182 --> 00:32:12.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: ‘Jehovah has done
astonishing things on the earth

00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:14.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—bringing an end to wars,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
breaking the bow and the spear,
and burning the military wagons.’

00:32:19.652 --> 00:32:22.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can just imagine the astonishing scene:

00:32:22.988 --> 00:32:25.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
going out into the Assyrian camp

00:32:25.074 --> 00:32:28.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing the entire army devastated.

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:31.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean for us?

00:32:31.038 --> 00:32:34.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we hate the war and violence
that plagues this world

00:32:34.375 --> 00:32:38.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and affects our dear brothers,
and we long for it to end.

00:32:38.796 --> 00:32:43.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
But until then, understanding that Jehovah
is still in the city

00:32:43.175 --> 00:32:48.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
—still in control of his people—
gives us complete confidence.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
No humans, no attack
of an Assyrianlike government,

00:32:52.518 --> 00:32:56.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
can stop the flow of that river
or shake the city.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the psalmist concludes in verse 11

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the reassuring echo of verse 1:

00:33:06.366 --> 00:33:08.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies is with us;

00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:13.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of Jacob is a secure refuge for us.”

00:33:13.665 --> 00:33:18.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know what
your individual future holds after Gilead

00:33:18.461 --> 00:33:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what assignments you’ll receive,

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you can be confident
that Jehovah “is in the city.”

00:33:24.551 --> 00:33:26.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s in control.

00:33:26.261 --> 00:33:29.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember the lesson of Gilead:

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay focused on “the river”

00:33:31.766 --> 00:33:35.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the river
that “make[s] the city of God rejoice,”

00:33:35.812 --> 00:33:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
the river that will flow throughout eternity.

00:33:51.328 --> 00:33:53.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Ahladis.

00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:55.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is absolutely
one of my favorite scriptures

00:33:55.874 --> 00:34:00.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so reassuring
during such challenging times.

00:34:00.545 --> 00:34:03.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we’re going to begin
a series of three talks

00:34:03.423 --> 00:34:05.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
by instructors from the Gilead School.

00:34:05.884 --> 00:34:09.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first of all, we’re going to start
with Brother Trent Lippold,

00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his theme for us is “The Under-Rower.”

00:34:14.893 --> 00:34:17.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is famously the object

00:34:17.396 --> 00:34:21.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the subject of a Bible account.

00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:25.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
We easily sympathize with him

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:30.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we can understand
his emotions and feelings at the time.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, his response

00:34:33.954 --> 00:34:37.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that which provides a powerful life lesson

00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:39.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our service to God.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re introduced to him
in the book of Mark chapter 14

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:49.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark chapter 14, beginning in verse 50.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 50 picks up the account

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:34:57.979 --> 00:35:01.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we read of the 11 faithful apostles:

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they all abandoned him and fled.

00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:09.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, a certain young man

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:11.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wearing only a fine linen garment
over his naked body

00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:14.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“began to follow him nearby,

00:35:14.454 --> 00:35:16.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they tried to seize him,

00:35:16.873 --> 00:35:19.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he left his linen garment behind
and got away naked.”

00:35:21.127 --> 00:35:23.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young man in this verse

00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:26.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
is understood to be John Mark,

00:35:26.799 --> 00:35:30.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice John Mark’s outstanding quality.

00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:34.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostles all fled,

00:35:34.682 --> 00:35:38.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says John Mark followed “nearby.”

00:35:39.979 --> 00:35:43.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
What tremendous courage of this young man!

00:35:43.233 --> 00:35:46.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the great men, the apostles, fled,

00:35:46.528 --> 00:35:50.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark stayed and he followed nearby.

00:35:50.824 --> 00:35:55.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, interestingly,
we know that Peter eventually also followed.

00:35:55.078 --> 00:35:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice this about Peter in verse 54:

00:35:59.082 --> 00:36:03.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Peter, from a good distance, followed.”

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:07.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark followed nearby.

00:36:07.007 --> 00:36:10.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this we see
not only the courage of John Mark,

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we also see his devotion to Jesus.

00:36:13.931 --> 00:36:15.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what extent he knew Jesus

00:36:15.766 --> 00:36:18.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
or had interactions with Jesus,
we don’t know.

00:36:18.644 --> 00:36:21.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he did have some.

00:36:21.146 --> 00:36:25.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his devotion and courage for his Master
is unquestionable here.

00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:29.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures also describe Mark, John Mark,

00:36:29.822 --> 00:36:32.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a strengthening aid”
and “a great comfort.”

00:36:32.449 --> 00:36:35.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were the observations of him
later in his life.

00:36:35.703 --> 00:36:38.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do know from the Scriptures
that John Mark

00:36:38.163 --> 00:36:42.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked in the background
for some very big personalities

00:36:42.876 --> 00:36:46.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the apostle Paul, the apostle Peter,

00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:48.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Barnabas.

00:36:48.966 --> 00:36:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark initially caught the attention
of the apostles

00:36:51.635 --> 00:36:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
—of Paul and Barnabas—
when he was in Jerusalem.

00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:59.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul, or Saul at the time, and Barnabas

00:36:59.977 --> 00:37:03.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
came there in 46 C.E.

00:37:03.439 --> 00:37:08.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they took John Mark with them
to the exciting assignment of Antioch,

00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:10.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Christianity was beginning to flourish,

00:37:10.988 --> 00:37:14.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and John Mark was brought along with them.

00:37:14.283 --> 00:37:16.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, in the year 47 C.E.,

00:37:16.494 --> 00:37:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark was selected
to go with Barnabas and Saul

00:37:20.123 --> 00:37:22.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the first missionary tour.

00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:25.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s described for us
in the book of Acts chapter 13.

00:37:28.423 --> 00:37:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 13:4, 5, it says:

00:37:32.135 --> 00:37:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So these men [that is, Barnabas and Saul],

00:37:35.138 --> 00:37:39.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sent out by the holy spirit,
went down to Seleucia,

00:37:39.058 --> 00:37:42.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.

00:37:42.228 --> 00:37:45.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they arrived in Salamis,
they began proclaiming the word of God

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the synagogues of the Jews.

00:37:47.275 --> 00:37:51.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also had John as an attendant.”

00:37:51.029 --> 00:37:53.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark

00:37:53.198 --> 00:37:55.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he is described here as “an attendant.”

00:37:55.867 --> 00:37:58.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote says “an assistant.”

00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:02.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer of Acts used
a very interesting word here for “attendant,”

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:06.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s a Greek word that literally means
“an under-rower.”

00:38:06.586 --> 00:38:10.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
An under-rower was a man
who worked below the decks

00:38:10.674 --> 00:38:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a large Roman naval vessel.

00:38:14.803 --> 00:38:18.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would be below deck,
he would have to row in unison

00:38:18.807 --> 00:38:21.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in cooperation) with his fellow rowers,

00:38:21.143 --> 00:38:25.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would have to follow the pace
set by the captain.

00:38:25.606 --> 00:38:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would this term be used
for John Mark in this instance?

00:38:29.318 --> 00:38:32.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a clue comes from verse 4,
where it says:

00:38:32.404 --> 00:38:35.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They sailed away to Cyprus.”

00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:38.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the metaphor of an under-rower

00:38:38.243 --> 00:38:40.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
now takes on greater meaning.

00:38:40.788 --> 00:38:43.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Incidentally, the same term
is used by the apostle Paul

00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:46.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he refers to himself
as a servant of God,

00:38:46.835 --> 00:38:50.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an attendant, in 1 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:52.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would that be significant?

00:38:52.049 --> 00:38:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why use it in 1 Corinthians?

00:38:54.093 --> 00:38:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in one of the bays next to Corinth,

00:38:56.804 --> 00:39:01.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
the large ships of the Roman navy
took port there.

00:39:01.434 --> 00:39:03.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, again, the metaphor

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the under-rower
would take on great meaning.

00:39:07.898 --> 00:39:10.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the infamous event

00:39:10.318 --> 00:39:13.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
occurred in Acts chapter 15

00:39:13.904 --> 00:39:18.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the event John Mark was an object of.

00:39:19.744 --> 00:39:22.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in Acts chapter 15,

00:39:22.872 --> 00:39:25.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning in verse 37, it says:

00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Barnabas was determined
to take along John, who was called Mark.

00:39:30.379 --> 00:39:34.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul, however, was not in favor
of taking him along with them,

00:39:34.217 --> 00:39:37.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seeing that he had departed
from them in Pamphylia

00:39:37.512 --> 00:39:40.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and had not gone with them to the work.

00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:43.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this there was a sharp burst of anger,

00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:45.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they separated from each other;

00:39:45.478 --> 00:39:49.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Barnabas took Mark along
and sailed away to Cyprus.”

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:55.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Denied an opportunity, denied a privilege,

00:39:55.155 --> 00:39:57.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does Mark do?

00:39:57.574 --> 00:40:02.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says he “sailed away
[with Barnabas] to Cyprus.”

00:40:02.245 --> 00:40:06.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark kept active in Jehovah’s service.

00:40:06.958 --> 00:40:08.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do that?

00:40:09.544 --> 00:40:12.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark was not so concerned

00:40:12.631 --> 00:40:14.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a lost privilege

00:40:14.799 --> 00:40:19.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he failed to appreciate
the opportunities that were in front of him.

00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:26.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, while he’s sailing away and working,
what’s Paul doing?

00:40:26.144 --> 00:40:29.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 40 says: “Paul selected Silas.”

00:40:29.982 --> 00:40:32.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 41 says:
“He went through Syria and Cilicia,

00:40:32.943 --> 00:40:34.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthening the congregations.”

00:40:36.154 --> 00:40:39.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you carry on in chapter 16,
we find him arriving

00:40:39.783 --> 00:40:42.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Derbe and Lystra,

00:40:42.202 --> 00:40:44.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 1 says

00:40:44.955 --> 00:40:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
he met Timothy, a disciple.

00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:49.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 3, what happens?

00:40:49.376 --> 00:40:53.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul expressed a desire
for Timothy to join him

00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:58.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark’s replacement.

00:40:59.845 --> 00:41:03.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, as Paul now begins
to travel with Timothy,

00:41:03.557 --> 00:41:06.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that the apostle Paul writes

00:41:06.143 --> 00:41:09.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Thessalonians within a year.

00:41:09.271 --> 00:41:11.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at 1 Thessalonians 1:1,

00:41:11.816 --> 00:41:16.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s greeting is
from Paul, Silas, and Timothy.

00:41:16.779 --> 00:41:18.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Thessalonians too is

00:41:18.948 --> 00:41:22.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Paul, Silas, and Timothy.

00:41:22.243 --> 00:41:26.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how Mark is feeling at this point.

00:41:26.622 --> 00:41:28.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Five years later,
he writes to the Corinthians.

00:41:28.833 --> 00:41:32.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, again,
now it’s from Paul and Timothy.

00:41:33.546 --> 00:41:38.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
During all this time,
where Timothy is rising, what’s Mark doing?

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s rowing.

00:41:41.304 --> 00:41:44.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark is continually,
faithfully serving Jehovah.

00:41:44.057 --> 00:41:47.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eleven years later,
in the years 60 C.E. to 61 C.E.,

00:41:47.393 --> 00:41:50.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul was in Rome, who was with him?

00:41:50.063 --> 00:41:51.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
John Mark.

00:41:52.482 --> 00:41:54.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Paul
wrote letters to various congregations,

00:41:54.692 --> 00:41:58.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
he describes John Mark.

00:41:58.404 --> 00:42:02.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in one of the letters
in sending greetings (this is in Colossians),

00:42:02.075 --> 00:42:06.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
he makes reference to the fact
that he had wanted to send John Mark

00:42:06.204 --> 00:42:09.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a personal representative
to the congregations.

00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:14.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that indicates to us
what kind of man Mark was

00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:16.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what reputation he had.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
A personal representative
was someone who was deeply trusted,

00:42:21.303 --> 00:42:26.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would have to represent Paul
before the congregations that he would visit.

00:42:26.057 --> 00:42:29.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the reputation of John Mark.

00:42:29.019 --> 00:42:33.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, there’s no record in the Scriptures
of the challenges

00:42:33.065 --> 00:42:35.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
that John Mark faced in his ministry.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no shipwrecks, no beatings,
no hunger, no left-for-dead for John Mark.

00:42:39.655 --> 00:42:44.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is one challenge that he faced
that is shared with us.

00:42:44.034 --> 00:42:47.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is his difficulty, or the challenge,

00:42:47.037 --> 00:42:51.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the apostle Paul—his brother.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:55.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, clearly, there were no hard feelings
between these two men,

00:42:55.212 --> 00:42:57.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though there was a difference.

00:42:57.381 --> 00:42:59.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
in Paul’s final words chronologically

00:42:59.842 --> 00:43:04.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the book of 2 Timothy chapter 4
in reference to John Mark,

00:43:04.513 --> 00:43:06.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
he tells Timothy: ‘Bring Mark.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:08.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is helpful’

00:43:10.185 --> 00:43:13.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the under-rower, John Mark.

00:43:13.314 --> 00:43:16.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly,
for all that we know about Timothy,

00:43:16.442 --> 00:43:18.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are no words recorded

00:43:18.903 --> 00:43:21.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Timothy’s in the Scriptures.

00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:25.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, John Mark wrote a Gospel.

00:43:25.576 --> 00:43:27.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a typical under-rower,

00:43:27.828 --> 00:43:30.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
he never mentioned his name.

00:43:30.915 --> 00:43:33.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we put the pieces together

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what is shared
of John Mark in the Scriptures,

00:43:36.212 --> 00:43:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
we get a portrait of a man

00:43:38.214 --> 00:43:42.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was (1) zealous for promoting
the good news in the worldwide field

00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:46.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (2) happy to serve others.

00:43:46.597 --> 00:43:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
This alone is worthy of our imitation.

00:43:50.727 --> 00:43:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is more.

00:43:53.563 --> 00:43:57.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your future, you may be the object

00:43:57.233 --> 00:44:01.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
caught up in a Paul-and-Barnabas moment.

00:44:01.112 --> 00:44:04.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may face changed circumstances

00:44:04.198 --> 00:44:08.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of health or family issues.

00:44:08.077 --> 00:44:12.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may be the one who has to work
in the shadow of a Timothy.

00:44:12.874 --> 00:44:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
A door may close for you

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:18.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be closed for you.

00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:23.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Mark, do not be so concerned
about lost privileges

00:44:23.176 --> 00:44:26.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you fail to appreciate the opportunities

00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:28.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are right in front of you.

00:44:28.765 --> 00:44:31.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you, like Mark,
keep your heart

00:44:31.893 --> 00:44:34.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your hands strong.

00:44:34.187 --> 00:44:36.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep them on the oars.

00:44:36.398 --> 00:44:37.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work in unison.

00:44:37.816 --> 00:44:42.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cooperate with your brothers and sisters
for the Master.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you, like Mark, be the under-rower.

00:44:55.751 --> 00:44:56.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:44:56.627 --> 00:45:00.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Lippold,
for that very practical counsel.

00:45:00.881 --> 00:45:03.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we’ll hear
from another one of the instructors

00:45:03.509 --> 00:45:06.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Gilead School,
Brother Richard Chilton.

00:45:06.512 --> 00:45:11.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his theme for us today is
“Where You Go I Will Go.”

00:45:13.227 --> 00:45:15.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do the following have in common?

00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:18.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Build an ark.

00:45:18.691 --> 00:45:21.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Choose 300 men.

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:24.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
March around the city seven times.

00:45:24.947 --> 00:45:27.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow this route to the Red Sea.

00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:31.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you figure it out?

00:45:31.078 --> 00:45:35.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was providing
his people with direction.

00:45:35.791 --> 00:45:38.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the case of these examples,

00:45:38.294 --> 00:45:42.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes that direction could appear to be,

00:45:42.298 --> 00:45:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s say, a bit unusual.

00:45:45.968 --> 00:45:49.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not too hard for us
to imagine Noah responding,

00:45:49.764 --> 00:45:52.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you want me to build a massive ark?”

00:45:53.476 --> 00:45:55.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Gideon asking,

00:45:55.102 --> 00:45:57.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just 300 men

00:45:57.313 --> 00:46:01.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against an army of 135,000

00:46:01.192 --> 00:46:02.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
—are you sure?”

00:46:03.903 --> 00:46:06.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Joshua replying:

00:46:06.114 --> 00:46:09.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“March around Jericho seven times

00:46:09.409 --> 00:46:12.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and just blow our horns?

00:46:12.203 --> 00:46:13.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s it?”

00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:16.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Moses saying,

00:46:16.624 --> 00:46:19.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are we headed to the Red Sea

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I believe
there is a much more direct route

00:46:22.422 --> 00:46:24.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Promised Land?”

00:46:25.633 --> 00:46:30.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all could have responded in such ways,

00:46:30.472 --> 00:46:32.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
but did they?

00:46:32.474 --> 00:46:35.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s allow the Bible
to help us find the answer

00:46:35.268 --> 00:46:38.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Genesis chapter 6.

00:46:38.605 --> 00:46:42.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Genesis 6:22,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that “Noah did according

00:46:45.946 --> 00:46:49.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to all that God had commanded him.

00:46:49.324 --> 00:46:53.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did just so.”

00:46:53.537 --> 00:46:56.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in the examples we’ve mentioned,

00:46:56.289 --> 00:47:00.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
they all “did just so.”

00:47:01.336 --> 00:47:05.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
The direction might not have been
what they expected,

00:47:05.048 --> 00:47:09.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they humbly made the mental turn,
so to speak,

00:47:09.261 --> 00:47:13.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they followed the divine guidance
wherever it was taking them.

00:47:15.267 --> 00:47:17.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because they did,

00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:20.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
they saved not only themselves

00:47:20.022 --> 00:47:23.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all those that were with them.

00:47:23.067 --> 00:47:28.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, the one leading them was Jehovah.

00:47:29.657 --> 00:47:32.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by their responsive actions,

00:47:32.535 --> 00:47:36.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were, in effect, saying to him:

00:47:36.372 --> 00:47:39.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where you go I will go.”

00:47:40.668 --> 00:47:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what about you dear graduates
here before us today?

00:47:45.715 --> 00:47:48.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like those faithful ones of old,

00:47:48.843 --> 00:47:53.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are not alone in navigating your way.

00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:57.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is where he has always been

00:47:57.685 --> 00:48:02.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
—at the helm, guiding his people.

00:48:02.148 --> 00:48:05.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only difference is that today

00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:07.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is providing direction

00:48:07.904 --> 00:48:11.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his “faithful and discreet slave,”

00:48:11.574 --> 00:48:15.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is
because of our limited understanding

00:48:15.078 --> 00:48:19.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at times the direction may appear to be

00:48:19.374 --> 00:48:22.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
a bit unusual.

00:48:22.377 --> 00:48:26.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nonetheless,
you have followed that direction,

00:48:26.506 --> 00:48:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what it was,
no matter where it was taking you.

00:48:31.636 --> 00:48:35.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for that we want to say, “Thank you.”

00:48:35.974 --> 00:48:40.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we want to thank
all of you in our listening audience

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being responsive
toward the direction provided.

00:48:45.358 --> 00:48:50.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we thank, especially,
you dear Gilead graduates before us today.

00:48:50.405 --> 00:48:52.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why?

00:48:52.407 --> 00:48:56.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because during the five months
that we have spent with you,

00:48:56.286 --> 00:48:58.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw you.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:03.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw how you closely followed
the direction of the faithful slave.

00:49:03.168 --> 00:49:06.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
You “did just so.”

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
when presenting your student assignments,

00:49:11.593 --> 00:49:13.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
you did so in English,

00:49:13.971 --> 00:49:18.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though, for most of you,
that was not your mother tongue.

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when COVID protocols were set in place,

00:49:21.562 --> 00:49:24.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw you follow all of them,

00:49:24.398 --> 00:49:27.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they might
have been inconvenient,

00:49:27.234 --> 00:49:30.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to keep you
and your classmates healthy.

00:49:31.405 --> 00:49:33.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you were given counsel,

00:49:33.824 --> 00:49:38.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only from your instructors
but from each other,

00:49:38.037 --> 00:49:40.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
you expressed gratitude for it

00:49:40.915 --> 00:49:44.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and immediately went to work at applying it.

00:49:45.628 --> 00:49:49.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw you grow in your love for one another,

00:49:49.673 --> 00:49:51.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God’s organization,

00:49:51.926 --> 00:49:55.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah, and for his Son, Jesus.

00:49:55.429 --> 00:49:58.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this was a direct result

00:49:58.974 --> 00:50:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your sensitivity

00:50:01.978 --> 00:50:04.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the direction of the faithful slave.

00:50:06.065 --> 00:50:09.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about after you leave this place?

00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:14.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if you are assigned back
to your country of origin,

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
you won’t be the same person that left

00:50:19.662 --> 00:50:24.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and things may not be the way
you remember them either.

00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we have full confidence

00:50:27.712 --> 00:50:32.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
that whatever future changes come your way,

00:50:32.425 --> 00:50:36.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will continue echoing the sentiments

00:50:36.179 --> 00:50:38.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Moabitess Ruth.

00:50:38.765 --> 00:50:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall when she was faced with numerous,
intimidating changes

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
what she said to Naomi.

00:50:46.147 --> 00:50:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her words are recorded for us
in Ruth chapter 1, the book bearing her name,

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 16 and 17:

00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:55.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ruth said:

00:50:56.908 --> 00:50:59.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not plead with me to abandon you,

00:50:59.953 --> 00:51:03.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to turn back from accompanying you;

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for where you go

00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:09.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will go,

00:51:09.254 --> 00:51:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and where you spend the night,
I will spend the night.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:18.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Your people will be my people,
and your God my God.

00:51:18.347 --> 00:51:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Where you die I will die,

00:51:21.558 --> 00:51:24.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and there I will be buried.

00:51:24.811 --> 00:51:29.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘May Jehovah do so to me
and add to it if anything but death

00:51:29.816 --> 00:51:34.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
should separate me from you.’”

00:51:36.073 --> 00:51:40.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what did all of this
actually mean for Ruth?

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant leaving what was familiar to her.

00:51:44.999 --> 00:51:47.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant adopting a people

00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:50.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
with beliefs different from hers.

00:51:50.671 --> 00:51:52.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant following customs

00:51:52.882 --> 00:51:56.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could result in her becoming
the wife of someone

00:51:56.302 --> 00:52:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
she did not choose or did not even know,
for that matter.

00:52:00.556 --> 00:52:05.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant never returning
to what she had left behind.

00:52:06.604 --> 00:52:08.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Ruth said to Naomi:

00:52:08.814 --> 00:52:11.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where you go I will go,”

00:52:11.484 --> 00:52:16.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
she meant with no clauses,
no exceptions, no bargaining.

00:52:16.489 --> 00:52:19.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was without question.

00:52:19.408 --> 00:52:22.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Ruth, these were not just words;

00:52:22.453 --> 00:52:25.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was her mindset.

00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:28.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the same mindset that Noah,

00:52:28.876 --> 00:52:33.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon, Joshua, and Moses had.

00:52:33.548 --> 00:52:37.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like them, if we endeavor

00:52:37.302 --> 00:52:41.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always see the one behind the direction,

00:52:41.806 --> 00:52:46.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be able to move
in heart harmony with the chariot

00:52:46.394 --> 00:52:51.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not under it,
not behind it, right alongside it.

00:52:52.317 --> 00:52:55.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, this thought brings back to my mind

00:52:55.862 --> 00:52:58.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fond memory.

00:52:58.156 --> 00:53:01.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall that when my wife and I
lived in South Africa,

00:53:01.076 --> 00:53:06.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I once observed a flock of birds in motion.

00:53:06.039 --> 00:53:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
What species?
I do not know.

00:53:09.292 --> 00:53:12.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m sure
they numbered into the thousands.

00:53:12.838 --> 00:53:15.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as they swirled and turned

00:53:15.799 --> 00:53:17.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a group in unison,

00:53:17.884 --> 00:53:22.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was a beautiful,
magnificent sight to behold.

00:53:23.265 --> 00:53:26.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s interesting is that scientists think

00:53:26.893 --> 00:53:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
that each bird focuses,
not on the entire flock,

00:53:31.481 --> 00:53:36.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on just a few
of its most nearest neighbors in flight.

00:53:37.029 --> 00:53:40.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
When those near them turn,

00:53:40.282 --> 00:53:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
they turn.

00:53:42.409 --> 00:53:47.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one does this,
creating a sort of harmonious wave effect.

00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:51.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:53:51.752 --> 00:53:56.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we display
by our speech and actions the mindset:

00:53:57.633 --> 00:54:02.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah,
where you and your slave go I will go,’

00:54:03.764 --> 00:54:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
we motivate others near us to do the same.

00:54:09.103 --> 00:54:13.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a change in theocratic direction comes

00:54:13.023 --> 00:54:15.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we make the turn,

00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
then our spiritual brothers and sisters
make the turn with us.

00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:26.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Jehovah’s people turn in sync,
in mid-flight, so to speak,

00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:31.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a beautiful thing
in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:54:31.459 --> 00:54:34.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Noah, Gideon,

00:54:34.545 --> 00:54:38.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua, Moses, and Ruth

00:54:38.633 --> 00:54:42.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
set the pattern for all of us,

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:45.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
now dear graduates,

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:47.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is your turn

00:54:47.892 --> 00:54:51.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set the pattern for others.

00:54:51.604 --> 00:54:54.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you continue to follow closely

00:54:54.941 --> 00:54:57.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
the direction provided by Jehovah

00:54:57.485 --> 00:55:00.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his faithful slave,

00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:04.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
others will see his blessing upon you.

00:55:04.492 --> 00:55:09.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see how
he is keeping you safe and secure.

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:13.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see your joy and contentment.

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:17.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And out of a keen desire
to have that same experience,

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:21.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
they too will be motivated to say:

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:24.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where you go I will go.”

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Chilton.

00:55:36.942 --> 00:55:41.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very, very practical advice
for the students and for all of us.

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:44.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate it so much.

00:55:44.032 --> 00:55:47.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll hear now
from the third and final instructor

00:55:47.286 --> 00:55:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Gilead School,
Brother James Cauthon.

00:55:49.872 --> 00:55:54.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his theme for us today is
“Counselor or Shepherd?”

00:55:56.754 --> 00:55:59.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which has greater appeal

00:55:59.214 --> 00:56:03.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an effective counselor or a loving shepherd?

00:56:03.469 --> 00:56:06.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re to be effective,
brothers and sisters,

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:10.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
in strengthening the organization
and building up the brotherhood,

00:56:10.768 --> 00:56:12.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a good subject to consider.

00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:15.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it includes you sisters too.

00:56:17.483 --> 00:56:21.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
A counselor can be defined
as one who gives advice.

00:56:21.153 --> 00:56:23.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the world has a lot of counselors.

00:56:23.572 --> 00:56:27.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve got marriage counselors
and financial counselors

00:56:27.201 --> 00:56:31.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bereavement counselors
and all kinds of counselors.

00:56:31.497 --> 00:56:35.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll find that their counsel varies

00:56:35.209 --> 00:56:38.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to their experience and education.

00:56:39.088 --> 00:56:43.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahithophel
is a Biblical example of a counselor,

00:56:43.718 --> 00:56:45.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible says what he advised

00:56:45.803 --> 00:56:49.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
was “considered as the word of the true God.”

00:56:50.308 --> 00:56:54.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, a person might feel
that he’s a good counselor,

00:56:54.103 --> 00:56:57.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he may freely offer advice,

00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:58.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of which

00:56:58.608 --> 00:57:05.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
may or may not be accepted.

00:57:07.867 --> 00:57:10.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe a solution-oriented husband

00:57:10.662 --> 00:57:13.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
counsels his emotionally distraught wife

00:57:13.873 --> 00:57:16.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just quit worrying.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or a well-versed elder
quickly reads a Bible text,

00:57:20.005 --> 00:57:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he advises
an extremely anxiety-filled publisher

00:57:23.633 --> 00:57:25.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just get over it.

00:57:27.304 --> 00:57:29.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
How effective is such counsel?

00:57:30.515 --> 00:57:34.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a saying,
People don’t care how much you know

00:57:34.227 --> 00:57:37.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they know how much you care.

00:57:38.857 --> 00:57:43.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Counsel is more effective
when the counselor is also a shepherd.

00:57:43.904 --> 00:57:47.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
A shepherd is one
who comforts, nourishes, listens,

00:57:47.824 --> 00:57:52.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
and does not ignore
the emotional needs of the distraught one.

00:57:52.704 --> 00:57:57.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives counsel, or advice,
but he always does more.

00:57:57.709 --> 00:58:00.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, he also shepherds.

00:58:00.754 --> 00:58:02.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he counsels,

00:58:02.756 --> 00:58:06.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
he tends to the person’s emotional needs

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:09.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he provides the needed follow-up.

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:11.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider how he dealt

00:58:11.473 --> 00:58:15.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an emotionally depressed prophet

00:58:15.602 --> 00:58:17.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the name of Elijah.

00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m turning to 1 Kings 19,

00:58:22.067 --> 00:58:24.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to consider just briefly

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
the interaction he had with Elijah.

00:58:27.573 --> 00:58:30.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you will recall
that he was driven by fear.

00:58:30.785 --> 00:58:34.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah was driven by fear of Jezebel.

00:58:34.288 --> 00:58:36.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah fled southward

00:58:36.499 --> 00:58:40.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 95 miles (150 km) to Beer-sheba,

00:58:40.086 --> 00:58:43.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he walked for about another
200 miles (320 km) to Mount Horeb.

00:58:45.174 --> 00:58:48.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now notice in verse 5, it says:

00:58:48.803 --> 00:58:51.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he [that is, Elijah]

00:58:51.305 --> 00:58:54.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“lay down and fell asleep
under the broom tree.

00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:58.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But suddenly an angel
touched him and said to him:

00:58:58.771 --> 00:59:00.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Get up and eat.’

00:59:00.815 --> 00:59:05.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he looked, there at his head
was a round loaf on heated stones

00:59:05.486 --> 00:59:07.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a jug of water.

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:10.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He ate and drank and lay down again.

00:59:10.867 --> 00:59:14.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Later the angel of Jehovah
came back a second time

00:59:14.746 --> 00:59:16.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and touched him and said:

00:59:16.623 --> 00:59:21.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Get up and eat,
for the journey will be too much for you.’

00:59:21.294 --> 00:59:23.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he got up and ate and drank,

00:59:23.463 --> 00:59:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in the strength of that nourishment

00:59:26.174 --> 00:59:30.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he went on for 40 days and 40 nights

00:59:30.553 --> 00:59:34.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
until he reached Horeb,
the mountain of the true God.”

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice,

00:59:38.687 --> 00:59:43.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angel awakened Elijah;

00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:46.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
ministered to him;

00:59:46.945 --> 00:59:51.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Elijah went back to sleep,
like depressed ones often do.

00:59:51.116 --> 00:59:53.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe the angel waited all night

00:59:53.452 --> 00:59:56.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he touched Elijah again

00:59:56.788 --> 00:59:59.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then gave him more nourishment

00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:04.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nourishment that would take him
40 days and 40 nights

01:00:04.087 --> 01:00:07.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his journey to Mount Horeb.

01:00:08.217 --> 01:00:11.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a question
you have to ask yourself:

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:15.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that that angel agreed

01:00:15.516 --> 01:00:17.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the way Elijah was acting?

01:00:19.061 --> 01:00:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think the angel
might have wanted to give a little counsel

01:00:23.273 --> 01:00:28.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tell Elijah:
“Look, Elijah, just get over it.

01:00:29.488 --> 01:00:33.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just trust God
and get back to your assignment”?

01:00:34.159 --> 01:00:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he didn’t.

01:00:36.203 --> 01:00:40.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think Jehovah
knew how Elijah was thinking?

01:00:40.499 --> 01:00:42.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think he agreed with it?

01:00:42.793 --> 01:00:44.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, definitely not.

01:00:44.795 --> 01:00:47.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, a counselor may have handled it one way,

01:00:47.798 --> 01:00:51.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah
—“the God of all comfort”—

01:00:51.218 --> 01:00:56.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
would first address Elijah’s emotional needs.

01:00:56.224 --> 01:01:01.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when Elijah finally entered
the cave at Mount Horeb,

01:01:01.229 --> 01:01:03.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you remember what Jehovah did?

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a calm, low, gentle voice,

01:01:07.902 --> 01:01:11.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: ‘Eijah, what is your business here?’

01:01:12.365 --> 01:01:16.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was a warm invitation
for Elijah to express himself.

01:01:16.452 --> 01:01:19.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Just talk to me,’ you see.

01:01:19.205 --> 01:01:20.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Elijah did.

01:01:20.623 --> 01:01:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 10,
and see what it was that Elijah said.

01:01:24.294 --> 01:01:28.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I have been absolutely zealous
for Jehovah the God of armies;

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:32.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the people of Israel
have forsaken your covenant.”

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elijah felt like his work was in vain.

01:01:35.555 --> 01:01:37.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he said: “I’m the only one left.”

01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:39.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah felt alone.

01:01:39.851 --> 01:01:44.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said: “They are seeking
to take [me away, take] my life away.”

01:01:44.856 --> 01:01:47.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elijah was also afraid.

01:01:48.151 --> 01:01:50.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah heard what he said,

01:01:50.153 --> 01:01:54.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he addressed all of Elijah’s concerns.

01:01:54.407 --> 01:01:56.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then afterward,

01:01:56.409 --> 01:01:58.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gave Elijah the encouragement

01:01:58.912 --> 01:02:02.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow him
to continue on in Jehovah’s service

01:02:02.582 --> 01:02:05.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
with boldness.

01:02:05.085 --> 01:02:07.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we learn
from this brief experience?

01:02:08.797 --> 01:02:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we learned that Jehovah
validated the man’s emotions

01:02:12.426 --> 01:02:15.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
without agreeing with his thinking.

01:02:15.637 --> 01:02:18.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we also learned
that it’s often not necessary

01:02:18.807 --> 01:02:21.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer a quick solution.

01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply allowing a person
to express themselves

01:02:24.605 --> 01:02:27.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
without feeling judged

01:02:27.608 --> 01:02:29.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
can bring tremendous relief.

01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:32.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, friends,

01:02:32.946 --> 01:02:36.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
being heard is so close to being loved

01:02:36.951 --> 01:02:40.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
that for the average person,
it’s indistinguishable.

01:02:41.705 --> 01:02:46.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jehovah, we’ll be more effective
if we’re patient shepherds that listen

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give thoughtful consideration

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the feelings of those
that we’re seeking to help.

01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:57.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here are four takeaway points, OK?

01:02:57.471 --> 01:02:58.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

01:02:59.974 --> 01:03:02.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be a listener, not a lecturer.

01:03:02.727 --> 01:03:04.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show empathy.

01:03:04.729 --> 01:03:09.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember,
empathy is seeing with the eyes of another,

01:03:09.734 --> 01:03:11.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
hearing with the ears of another,

01:03:11.986 --> 01:03:15.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feeling with the heart of another.

01:03:16.032 --> 01:03:18.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easy, friends, for imperfect humans

01:03:18.951 --> 01:03:22.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take themselves too seriously,

01:03:22.538 --> 01:03:26.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when they’re given
a position of responsibility.

01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:28.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at times

01:03:28.878 --> 01:03:33.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may even be best to refrain
from offering counsel too soon

01:03:33.925 --> 01:03:38.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that creates an air of superiority.

01:03:40.098 --> 01:03:43.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Conversely, a willingness to hear

01:03:43.017 --> 01:03:45.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
even “wild talk” from another

01:03:45.979 --> 01:03:49.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reveal the depth of our own humility.

01:03:50.483 --> 01:03:52.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point number two:

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Validate people’s emotions,
and don’t just dismiss them.

01:03:57.282 --> 01:03:58.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feelings are real,

01:03:58.909 --> 01:04:03.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
so know the difference between
validating and invalidating statements.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can see why you would feel that way.

01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:10.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
That must be really hard.”

01:04:10.253 --> 01:04:13.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, when we listen with empathy,

01:04:13.006 --> 01:04:15.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’re really saying is:

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You matter to me.

01:04:19.513 --> 01:04:23.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re important, and I care how you feel.”

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:27.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally,
when you validate the other person,

01:04:27.479 --> 01:04:30.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
they become significantly more likely

01:04:30.232 --> 01:04:33.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen to advice or counsel later.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:38.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, there is a difference between—

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:41.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the way, let me just say this:

01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:48.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Counsel is not necessarily good
just because it’s accurate.

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:52.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frankly, how you give it
and when you give it is important.

01:04:52.796 --> 01:04:54.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
So try to remember that.

01:04:54.798 --> 01:04:57.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because it’s accurate,
doesn’t make it good.

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:02.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a difference too between
validating and devastating.

01:05:03.557 --> 01:05:07.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know, you’re too sensitive.”

01:05:07.311 --> 01:05:09.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What’s the big deal?”

01:05:09.313 --> 01:05:11.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t want to hear it.”

01:05:11.315 --> 01:05:13.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t have time for this.”

01:05:13.401 --> 01:05:15.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You need to work on your spirituality.”

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, although we may not mean it,

01:05:19.824 --> 01:05:24.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
this can translate into:
“You’re not important.

01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:26.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your feelings aren’t important.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
And frankly, I don’t really care.”

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point number three:

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acknowledge a vulnerability.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:39.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing personal thoughts
and emotions can be difficult,

01:05:39.052 --> 01:05:41.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
uncomfortable, and even scary.

01:05:42.388 --> 01:05:47.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I think that we’re encouraged
 to develop fellow feeling.

01:05:48.186 --> 01:05:50.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, point number four:

01:05:50.396 --> 01:05:53.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offering counsel is entirely optional.

01:05:53.566 --> 01:05:56.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many of us, brothers,
have been on a shepherding call,

01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:58.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve said virtually nothing?

01:05:58.196 --> 01:06:02.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the publisher, the brother or sister,
afterward says:

01:06:02.701 --> 01:06:03.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know what?

01:06:03.702 --> 01:06:06.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the best
shepherding call I ever had.”

01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:12.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what some may need
is not some solution for the problem

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
but simply to talk to a good listener

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:17.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone who will not tell them
how they’re supposed to feel,

01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:21.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will listen without being judgmental.

01:06:22.095 --> 01:06:25.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
The saying is, friends, Time is life.

01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:28.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we won’t give a brother our time,

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:32.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you really think
we would give our life for him?

01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:37.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we ‘show favor to the lowly one’
by giving him time and attention,

01:06:37.986 --> 01:06:40.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are, in fact, “lending to Jehovah.”

01:06:40.614 --> 01:06:45.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Bible says
that “he will repay” us in our time of need.

01:06:45.494 --> 01:06:48.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
So weave counsel and shepherding together,

01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:52.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ll be treasured by all those
around you and, most of all,

01:06:52.793 --> 01:06:54.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

01:07:06.265 --> 01:07:08.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Cauthon,

01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:12.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that very wise and practical counsel.

01:07:12.146 --> 01:07:14.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure elders all around the world

01:07:14.648 --> 01:07:17.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
will benefit so much from hearing that talk

01:07:17.443 --> 01:07:20.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it goes up on JW Broadcasting.

01:07:20.071 --> 01:07:24.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed Part 1 of the graduation.

01:07:24.116 --> 01:07:26.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parts 2 and 3 will be available

01:07:26.661 --> 01:07:29.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org later this month.

01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:31.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,

01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:35.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s visit the island of Greenland.

01:07:35.128 --> 01:07:38.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the world’s largest island.

01:07:38.172 --> 01:07:40.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
What picture comes to your mind?

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
White sandy beaches?

01:07:42.301 --> 01:07:43.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Warm sunny weather?

01:07:43.803 --> 01:07:45.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:07:45.096 --> 01:07:48.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greenland is among the closest countries

01:07:48.516 --> 01:07:52.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the North Pole
and is almost entirely covered by ice.

01:07:52.645 --> 01:07:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
The northern lights dance on the night sky,

01:07:56.399 --> 01:08:01.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
arctic foxes and polar bears roam the tundra,

01:08:01.112 --> 01:08:05.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and icebergs dot
the turquoise waters of the fjords.

01:08:05.658 --> 01:08:10.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greenland is the birthplace of the kayak,
as Eskimo hunters

01:08:10.372 --> 01:08:14.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed a narrow vessel
to navigate these icy waterways.

01:08:15.877 --> 01:08:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most locals travel by boat,
since roadways are limited.

01:08:19.756 --> 01:08:22.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters
use their boats to reach

01:08:22.342 --> 01:08:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
remote communities
scattered around the island.

01:08:26.221 --> 01:08:28.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
The preachers of God’s Word in Greenland

01:08:28.807 --> 01:08:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a rich history
of using inventive transportation.

01:08:33.645 --> 01:08:36.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first publishers on the island,

01:08:36.148 --> 01:08:39.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kristen Lauritsen and Arne Hjelm,

01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
even used dogsleds to complete
their 1,600-kilometer,

01:08:43.572 --> 01:08:46.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 1,000-mile, preaching tour.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, publishers here are still resourceful.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:53.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
They find interested ones in businesses,

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:57.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
at fishing docks,
and through telephone witnessing.

01:09:00.255 --> 01:09:03.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greenlandic language
can be complex with its long,

01:09:03.133 --> 01:09:05.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
multisyllabic words,

01:09:05.844 --> 01:09:09.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet great care is taken
to translate publications and videos

01:09:09.765 --> 01:09:13.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the 57,000 who speak the language.

01:09:13.394 --> 01:09:15.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
On October 30, 2021,

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:19.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures</i>

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:22.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released in Greenlandic, a delight

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:25.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those on the island who love God’s Word.

01:09:25.698 --> 01:09:28.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
All 120 publishers of Greenland

01:09:28.617 --> 01:09:32.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their warm love and greetings
to the worldwide brotherhood.

01:09:32.496 --> 01:09:35.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:09:35.833 --> 01:09:38.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
